45,If the amount of food wasted around the world were reduced by just 25 there would be enough food to feed all the people who are malnourished according to the UN Each year 13bn tonnes of food about a third of all that is produced is wasted including about 45 of all fruit and vegetables 35 of sh and seafood 30 of cereals 20 of dairy products and 20 of meat Meanwhile 795 million people suffer from severe hunger and malnutrition Wellpublicized attempts to combat the loss of food such as recent laws in France that require supermarkets to distribute unsold food to charities have highlighted the issue of food waste identi ed by the UN as one of the great challenges to achieving food security Estimates suggest that by 2050 food production will need to have increased by 60 on 2005 levels to feed a growing global population Reducing food wastage would ease the burden on resources as the world attempts to meet future demand The problem is global but manifests itself in very different ways In developing countries there are high levels of what is known as food loss which is unintentional wastage often due to poor equipment transportation and infrastructure In wealthy countries there are low levels of unintentional losses but high levels of food waste which involves food being thrown away by consumers because they have purchased too much or by retailers who reject food because of strict aesthetic standards In developed countries consumers and retailers throw away between 30 and 40 of all food purchased whereas in poorer countries only 5 to 16 of food is thrown away According to a 2011 report in Europe and North America each person wasted 95 to 115kg of otherwise edible food annually whereas in subSaharan Africa and south and southeast Asia the equivalent waste was just 6 to 11kg In the developing world food waste is virtually nonexistent says Robert van Otterdijk coordinator of the UN Food and Agriculture Organizations Save Food programme Food waste is happening in countries where people can afford to throw away food One statistic is that the amount of food wasted by consumers in industrialized countries 222m tonnes a year is almost the same as the total net food production of subSaharan Africa 230m tonnes But food losses on the other hand are really rampant in developing countries because of the underdeveloped conditions they have from management of production to transportation and distribution The environmental impact of food loss and waste is high The carbon footprint of food produced and not eaten is estimated at 33 gigatonnes of CO2 meaning that if food waste were a country it would rank as the third highest national emitter of greenhouse gases after the US and China About 14bn hectares or close to 30 of available agricultural land is used to grow or farm food that is subsequently wasted And more surface and groundwater or blue water is used to produce wasted food around the globe than is used for agriculture by any single country including India and China The whole issue of climate change has to do with our economy of production and consumption being out of balance with what the Earth can provide says van Otterdijk Production of food is one of the biggest production sectors in the world and if onethird of all this is just produced in vain you can imagine what a huge impact this has on the natural resources on land water energy and greenhouse gas emissions The worst food waste offenders are the US Canada Australia and New Zealand where consumers waste 39 of all food purchased followed by Europe where about 31 of all food purchased by consumers is thrown away In the UK 15m tonnes of food is lost or wasted each year British consumers throw away 42m tonnes of edible food each year This means that 117 of all food purchased is avoidably wasted at an estimated cost to each family of 700 a year or almost 60 a month The foods most commonly found in British bins are bread vegetables fruit and milk According to a nationwide analysis of food waste in UK households the most wasted food in the UK by weight is bread with consumers throwing away 414000 tonnes 224 of all bread purchased By percentage the most wasted food is lettuce and leafy salads of which consumers throw away 38 64000 tonnes of all they buy The most wasted meat by both percentage and weight is poultry of which 13 of all edible parts not including bones is wasted and the most wasted fruit by percentage is melon with the equivalent of more than a quarter of each melon thrown in the bin The UK has made progress in the past ten years after a concerted campaign to reduce wastage It is singled out by van Otterdijk as one of the great successes in combating food waste Between 2007 and 2012 the amount of avoidable food waste produced by UK households decreased by 21 from 53m tonnes to 42m tonnes largely due to greater awareness Of the food that is not eaten less is ending up in land ll In 200001 only 14 of household waste was recycled or composted but by 201112 the amount of composted food had risen to 43 Van Otterdijk says there has been a very encouraging unexpected continuing interest in the subject of food waste enabling grassroots campaigns around the world to gain momentum We have to do much more and it needs the participation of public and private sectors he says But if it continues like this with the same momentum maybe after ten years well have globally signi cant results,If the amount of food wasted around the world were reduced by just 25 there would be enough food to feed all the people who are

113,We may not yet be living in an age of ying cars as predicted in the 1985 lm Back to the Future II but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is arguably as exciting and almost as farfetched Experts agree that economic and demographic changes technological advances and environmental concerns are fundamentally altering the transportation landscape Its a very dynamic time said Robert Puentes of the Brookings Institutions Metropolitan Policy Program think tank Theres a focus on a tighter connection between the role of transportation and the economic health of cities and its impact on people As the average US commute lengthens and the countrys infrastructure ages badly cities across the US are being forced to rede ne what transportation is Increasingly urban planners transportation experts and scientists are realizing that old autocentric models focused on easing traf c congestion arent enough to tackle issues like population growth and carbon emissions and transportation is now more than ever an integral component of a citys larger sustainability efforts Big US cities like Los Angeles Seattle and Chicago are working to make better use of their streets by adding more bus lanes augmenting pedestrian walkways and expanding their rail options while at the same time working with the private sector on advanced technologies that will allow a vehicle to drive itself and communicate with other vehicles and its environment essentially making transportation intelligent The most sustainable places to live are those places that have multimodal transport systems Puentes said You cant be a global competitive city if you dont have a robust transportation network Here are three of the key trends that experts predict will shape the transportation industry over the coming years Connectivity The rise of ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft essentially taxis booked at the click of a smartphone button and apps like Waze which uses realtime traf c data to nd the quickest routes for drivers are dramatically changing how people get around and affecting the very way in which traf c moves through a city Communication between riders and drivers between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era according to Allan Clelland an expert on transportation technology According to a recent study from the UCLAs Institute of Transportation Studies vehicle travel has declined among millennials individuals born roughly between the early 1980s and early 2000s compared to previous generations According to the study those born in the 1990s are making 4 fewer car trips and travelling 18 fewer miles per year on average than members of previous generations did at the same stage in their lives Meanwhile those still driving cars are dealing with less traf c thanks to Waze Experts say the traf c app has eased congestion on motorways and reduced travel times for drivers but also led to a problematic rise in cars moving through residential neighbourhoods This has angered residents who claim the increased traf c on their quiet roads reduces their quality of life This trend could continue as vehicletovehicle data communication as well as communication between vehicles and the surrounding infrastructure grows Currently a traf c light can detect when a car is approaching but thats about it Companies are working to develop technology that will enable a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling Automation Driverless cars have been in the headlines ever since Google began road testing the vehicles back in 2012 but noone really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace However the partial automation of cars is already underway Alexandre Bayen of the University of California expects automation will progress in stages rst there might be automated buses with their own lanes then perhaps lorries in ports or mining towns essentially vehicles that are connected electronically and travel in single le The idea of a fully automated transportation system is intriguing because it has the potential to improve safety by removing human error and increase the ef ciency of car owners who can get on with other tasks during a long commute It can also help reduce carbon emissions and traf c congestion and allow more people access to cars But even if driverless technology were ready to hit the roads now it would take a long time to get fully automated given the average age of cars on the road is 115 years old To see what driverless cars might look like in action go to the video at vimeocom37751380 Environmental concern As the world races to avoid catastrophic climate change and countries states and cities work to meet ambitious emissions goals these policies could also have a big impact on the future of transportation spurring everything from zero and lowemission vehicles to apps that encourage more walking biking and carpooling Sharon Feigon executive director of the Shared Use Mobility Center envisages a future where a person can use a transit pass that gives them access to numerous modes of transport in a given day If their train is delayed for instance they can access a city bike take a shuttle or rent a vehicle through a car share programme using the same pass Were going to see these systems packaged together and make it as easy as possible to connect them up with each other so people can transfer seamlessly between them she said When considering the future of transportation its also important to keep in mind why people travel they may be going to work to meet friends or family or to do the shopping Technologies and trends that reduce the need for those trips say virtual meetings or telecommuting could also have a big impact on transportation There was a time when the idea of a ying car represented the height of innovation but the technologies being imagined and developed now could be seen as even more sophisticated and more useful in tackling the social and environmental threats that we face over the coming decades,We may not yet be living in an age of ying cars as predicted in the 1985 lm Back to the Future II but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is just as

97,Scientists have connected the brains of a pair of animals and allowed them to share sensory information in a major step towards what the researchers call the worlds first organic computer The US team fitted two rats with devices called braintobrain interfaces that let the animals collaborate on simple tasks to earn rewards such as a drink of water In one radical demonstration of the technology the scientists used the internet to link the brains of two rats separated by thousands of miles with one in the researchers lab at Duke University in Durham North Carolina and the other in Natal Brazil Led by Miguel Nicolelis a pioneer of devices that allow paralyzed people to control computers and robotic arms with their thoughts the researchers say their latest work may enable multiple brains to be hooked up to share information These experiments showed that we have established a sophisticated direct communication linkage between brains Nicolelis said in a statement Basically we are creating what I call an organic computer The scientists first demonstrated that rats can share and act on each others sensory information by electrically connecting their brains via tiny grids of electrodes that reach into the motor cortex the brain region that processes movement The rats were trained to press a lever when a light went on above it When they performed the task correctly they got a drink of water To test the animals ability to share brain information they put the rats in two separate compartments Only one compartment had a light that came on above the lever When the rat pressed the lever an electronic version of its brain activity was sent directly to the other rats brain In trials the second rat responded correctly to the imported brain signals 70 of the time by pressing the lever Remarkably the communication between the rats the rats collaborated on a task that required them to distinguish between narrow and wide openings using their whiskers was twoway If the receiving rat failed at the task the first rat was not rewarded with a drink and appeared to change its behaviour to make the task easier for its partner In further experiments In the final test the scientists connected rats on different continents and beamed their brain activity back and forth over the internet Even though the animals were on different continents with the resulting noisy transmission and signal delays they could still communicate said Miguel PaisVieira the first author of the study This tells us that we could create a workable network of animal brains distributed in many different locations Nicolelis said the team is now working on ways to link several animals brains at once to solve more complex tasks We cannot even predict what kinds of emergent properties would appear when animals begin interacting as part of a brainnet he said In theory you could imagine that a combination of brains could provide solutions that individual brains cannot achieve by themselves The research is published in the journal Scientific Reports Anders Sandberg who studies the ethics of neurotechnologies at the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University said the work was very important in helping to understand how brains encode information But the implications of the technology and its potential future uses are far broader said Sandberg The main reason we are running the planet is that we are amazingly good at communicating and coordinating Without that although we are very smart animals we would not dominate the planet I dont think theres any risk of supersmart rats from this he added Theres a big difference between sharing sensory information and being able to plan Im not worried about an imminent invasion of rat multiborgs Very little is known about how thoughts are encoded and how they might be transmitted into another persons brain so that is not a realistic prospect any time soon And much of what is in our minds is what Sandberg calls a draft of what we might do Often we dont want to reveal those drafts that would be embarrassing and confusing And a lot of those drafts are changed before we act Most of the time I

careful what it wishes for The direct action group UK Uncut plans to turn dozens of the coffee empires UK branches into crches refuges and homeless shelters to highlight the chains tax avoidance tactics The announcement of the action comes on the day a Starbucks executive faces questions from the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee over why the company paid no corporation tax in the UK during the past three years despite senior US management trumpeting the companys profitable operations in Britain In his appearance before the committee Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead will attempt to repair the companys reputation which continues to suffer because of the controversy MPs accused HM Revenue Customs HMRC officials of having cosy relationships with big businesses Speaking about the arrangements with Starbucks the Conservative MP Richard Bacon said It smells And it doesnt smell of coffee it smells bad The campaign group UK Uncut is attempting to draw a link between government cuts in particular those that affect women and tax avoidance by multinational businesses Sarah Greene a UK Uncut activist said funding for refuges and rape crisis centres faced cuts unless companies paid their fair share of tax HMRC estimates around 32bn was lost to tax avoidance in 2011 Greene said the government could easily bring in billions that could fund vital services by clamping down on tax avoidance The group which rose to prominence after staging a sitin at Vodafone stores Topshop and Fortnum Mason turned its attentions to Starbucks last month after an investigation by Reuters discovered the company had paid only 86m in corporation tax since launching in the UK in 1998 despite cumulative sales of 3bn Longstanding Uncut campaigner Anna Walker said Weve chosen to really highlight the impact of the cuts on women So there is going to be a real focus on transforming Starbucks into those services that are being cut by the government such as refuges and crches Starbucks is a really great target because it is on every high street across the country and thats what UK Uncut finds really important people can take action in their local areas she said Several international organizations have faced criticism over their UK accounts with Amazon eBay Facebook Google and Ikea all paying little or no corporation tax despite large British operations However according to pollsters at YouGovs BrandIndex Starbucks has suffered the deepest damage to its image The coffee store chain insists it pays the correct level of taxes The group Chief Executive Howard Schultz has said in a statement Starbucks has always paid taxes in the UK despite recent suggestions to the contrary Over the last three years alone our company has paid more than 160m in various taxes including National Insurance contributions VAT and business rates Margaret Hodge who chairs the Public Accounts Committee told parliament last month that Apple eBay Facebook Google and Starbucks had avoided nearly 900m of tax The Prime Minister David Cameron responded to the claim by saying Im not happy with the current situation I think HMRC needs to look at it very carefully We do need to make sure we are encouraging these businesses to invest in our country as they are but they should be paying fair taxes as well A spokeswoman for Starbucks said While the subject of tax law can be extremely complex Starbucks respects and complies with tax laws and accounting rules in each of the 61 countries where we do business including the UK a market that we remain committed to for the long term Weve posted the facts about our tax practices in the UK on our website Starbucks economic impact in the UK goes far beyond our stores and partners employees We spend hundreds of millions of pounds with local suppliers on milk cakes and sandwiches and on store design and renovations When you take into account the indirect employment created by Starbucks investments in the UK the companys extended economic impact to the UK economy exceeds 80m annually We hope that UK Uncut will respect the wellbeing of our partners and customers and recognize the value that we add to the

153,Scarlett Johansson is suing a French novelist for 50000 in damages alleging that his work of ction makes fraudulent claims about her personal life La Premiere chose quon regarde The First Thing We Look At by Gregoire Delacourt tells the story of a French model who looks so similar to the American actor that the books lead male character thinks it is Johansson herself In the novel the models looks mean that men see her only as a sex object while women are jealous of her She has a series of adventures as Johansson until she is eventually found out and in the end dies in a car crash Johansson herself is not attered by the best selling literary work Her lawyer Vincent Toledano told Le Figaro that Delacourts novel constituted a violation and fraudulent and illegal exploitation of her name her reputation and her image He said the novel contains defamatory claims about her private life and has now gone to court to try to stop the book being translated or adapted for cinema The court case began in Paris on Wednesday afternoon though neither Johansson nor Delacourt was present The freedom of expression that she defends as an artist is not in question Toledano said Such activities for purely mercantile ends have nothing to do with creativity Delacourt has tried explaining that he chose to reference Johansson because she is the archetype of beauty today He said I wrote a work of ction My character is not Scarlett Johansson The author recently hit out against the actor on French radio saying the legal action was rather sad He said It freaks me out to think that when you talk of a character in a novel judges can get involved Delacourt has become one of Frances bestloved authors his previous novel My List of Desires was translated into 47 languages and is now being adapted into a lm But he said he was speechless when he found out Johansson was suing him I thought shed get in contact to ask me to go for a coffee with her I didnt write a novel about a celebrity he said I wrote a real love story and a homage to feminine beauty especially interior beauty If an author can no longer mention the things that surround us a brand of beer a monument an

taking legal action was crazy We have never known anything like it It is all the more surprising for the fact that the novel is not even about Scarlett Johansson It is about a woman who is Scarlett Johanssons double DelacourtslawyerAnneVeilwhoisalso representing publisher JC Latte Ironically the authors legal situation would be far easier had he published the book in Johanssons home country rather than France Lloyd Jassin a New York intellectual property lawyer told Time that the case would be unlikely to be considered in the United States because the book would be protected by the First Amendment The First Amendment doesnt look at most books as commercial uses or commercial propositions he said If her name or likeness is relevant literarily if theres signi cance and literary merit to using her name between the covers the First Amendment steps in However in France the legal position is more complicated and personality rights are taken much more seriously Jassin says I thought she might send me owers as it was a declaration of love for her but she didnt understand Delacourt said Its a strange paradox but a very American one,Scarlett Johansson is suing a French novelist for

Delacourt is one of Frances bestloved authors his previous novel My List of Desires was translated into 47 languages and is now being adapted into a lm But he said he was speechless when he found out Johansson was suing him I thought shed get in contact to ask me to go for a coffee with her I didnt write a novel about a celebrity he said I wrote a real love story about feminine beauty especially interior beauty If an author can no longer mention the things that surround us a brand of beer a monument an actor its going to be complicated to produce ction Im not sure shes even read the novel because it hasnt been translated yet Emmanuelle Allibert spokeswoman for publisher JC Lattes said taking legal action was crazy We have never known anything like it It is all the more surprising because the novel is not even about Scarlett Johansson It is about a woman who is Scarlett Johanssons double Ironically the authors legal situation would be far easier if he had published the book in Johanssons home country rather than France Lloyd Jassin a New York lawyer said that the case would most likely not go to court in the United States because the book would be protected by the First Amendment He said that if theres signi cance and literary merit to using her name in the book the First Amendment would protect the authors right to do so However in France the legal position is more complicated and personality rights are taken much more seriously Jassin says I thought she might send me owers as the book was a declaration of love for her but she didnt understand Delacourt

149,It is hard to tell exactly where the noise is coming from but impossible to miss it from anywhere in Damascus all day and night you can hear the dull thud and boom of artillery rockets or planes pounding rebel positions the sound of war getting closer to Syrias capital But just over two years into the Syrian crisis the longest and bloodiest of the Arab uprisings ignoring the sound of death and destruction nearby has become the new normal for Damascenes Over the weekend men could be seen puffing on water pipes in a palmshaded park children playing between the flowerbeds and couples chatting on benches as the unmistakable thunderclap of high explosive could be heard a few miles away smoke rising between the minarets of a nearby Ottomanera mosque No one seemed to notice Actually you do get used to it after a while said George an IT technician from a village on the coast But you never know exactly what they are hitting That usually becomes clear later from video clips posted by opposition media outlets on YouTube The sinister background noise is doubly disturbing because the government tries so hard to preserve a jaunty air of business as usual As you can see everything here is fine but we have to hit the terrorists these extremists an army officer announced An official whose route home has come under attack from rebels in Daraya said If I was afraid I would just shut my door and stay inside I have to work and I am not afraid If I dont defend my country who will Ordinary citizens in private conversation are less defiant In the centre of town a shopkeeper complained sadly that his baby daughter cries at the sound of shelling Zeina a twentysomething student fears becoming desensitized to suffering and perhaps to danger too In the beginning when there started to be explosions I used to have nightmares she reflected Now I can sleep through anything And the risks are multiplying even closer to home In Sabaa Bahrat Square in what was supposed to be the safest part of Damascus a car bomb detonated leaving a blackened concrete facade broken windows and mangled metal as well as blast damage to the imposing structure of the Syrian Central Bank next

devastating bombing of the national security crisis cell in July 2012 when four of Assads most senior aides were killed Concrete blast barriers often painted in the Syrian flags black red and white now protect official premises not just the military or defence installations that are obvious targets The Iranian Embassy in Mezze its turquoise mosaic front giving an exotic glimpse of Isfahan or

174,A major international row with wideranging 1 implications for global drugs policy has erupted over the right of Bolivias indigenous Indian tribes to chew coca leaves the principal ingredient in cocaine Bolivia has obtained a special exemption from the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs the framework that governs international drugs policy allowing its indigenous people to chew the leaves Bolivia had argued that the convention was 2 in opposition to its new constitution adopted in 2009 which obliges it to protect native and ancestral coca as cultural patrimony and maintains that coca in its natural state is not a narcotic South American Indians have chewed coca 3 leaves for centuries The leaves reputedly provide energy and are said to have medicinal qualities Supporters of Bolivias position praised it for standing up for the rights of indigenous people The Bolivian move is inspirational and groundbreaking said Danny Kushlick Head of External Affairs at the Transform Drug Policy Foundation which promotes drug liberalization It shows that any country that has had enough of the war on drugs can change the terms of its engagement with the UN conventions However the UNs International Narcotics Control 4 Board INCB which monitors implementation of the global drug treaties has accused Bolivia of threatening the integrity of the international drug control regime A number of countries including the UK the US Italy Sweden the Netherlands and Russia opposed Bolivias demands The UKs submission to the UN which oversees 5 the convention said that it acknowledges and respects the cultural importance of the coca leaf in Bolivia but it adds The United Kingdom is concerned that the reservation could lead to increases in coca production and crucially the amount of coca diverted to the cocaine trade As such the reservation would weaken international law as it relates to the global effort to tackle the drugs trade and could weaken the international communitys response to that trade The right of indigenous communities in South 6 Americas Andean region to chew coca leaf was removed in 1964 when Bolivia was under a dictatorship and it signed up to the convention But under the terms of the agreement Bolivia was given 25 years to implement the ban This expired in 1989 and since then the issue has been under dispute In 2011 Bolivia whose President Evo Morales 7 is a former coca producer formally notified the UN of its withdrawal from the convention On Friday it reacceded to the convention but with an exemption from the prohibition on the chewing of coca leaves The move is the first of its kind in the history 8 of UN drugcontrol treaties and has sparked concerns that other countries may apply for amendments The Russian government has argued that the move will lead to an increase in illegal circulation of cocaine and warned that it also sets a dangerous precedent that could be used by other states in creating a more liberal drugcontrol regime The British parliaments Home Affairs Select 9 Committee has recommended that Bolivias request should be backed by the UK government arguing that it was important that countries remained within the single convention Bolivias reaccession could be blocked only if a third or more of the 184 countries that have signed up to the convention opposed its request There are suspicions that the US and UK are frantically lobbying other countries to gain sufficient numbers to block Bolivias request Nancie Prudhomme Projects Director at the 10 International Centre on Human Rights and Drug Policy criticized the coordinated opposition to Bolivias demands These objections are legally questionable she said They support an arbitrary and overbroad provision and apply international drug laws in a vacuum This is not appropriate No state has paid any attention to decades of developing international norms on cultural and indigenous rights which support Bolivias efforts The decision to ban coca chewing was based on 11 a 1950 report produced by the UN Commission of Inquiry on the Coca Leaf which proponents of drug liberalization say was not based on supporting evidence In an interview in 1949 the head of the Commission Howard B Fonda signalled his opposition to the chewing of coca leaves before his inquiry had begun Fonda told an interviewer We believe that the daily inveterate use of coca leaves by chewing is not only thoroughly noxious and therefore detrimental but is also the cause of racial degeneration in many centres of population and of the decadence that visibly shows in numerous Indians Our studies will confirm the certainty of our assertions and we hope we can present a rational plan of action to attain the absolute and sure abolition of this pernicious habit The growing of coca leaves is legal and licensed 12 in Bolivia The policy has been credited with a fall in cocaine production in the country leading some experts to see the Bolivian model as a way forward for other countries,The right of Bolivias indigenous Indian tribes to 1 chew coca leaves the main ingredient in cocaine has caused major international disagreement which could have a significant effect on global drugs policy Bolivia has received a special exemption from the 1961 Convention on Narcotic Drugs which controls international drugs policy The exemption allows Bolivias indigenous people to chew the leaves Bolivia had argued that the convention was in 2 opposition to its new constitution adopted in 2009 which says it must protect native and ancestral coca as part of its cultural heritage and maintains that coca in its natural state is not a narcotic South American Indians have chewed coca 3 leaves for centuries The leaves are said to provide energy and have medicinal qualities Supporters of Bolivias position said that defending the rights of indigenous people was the right thing to do The Bolivian move is inspirational and groundbreaking said Danny Kushlick of the Transform Drug Policy Foundation which supports drug liberalization It shows that any country that is fed up with the war on drugs can change its relations with the UN conventions However the UNs

US Italy Sweden the Netherlands and Russia opposed Bolivias demands The UK told the UN that it respects the cultural 5 importance of the coca leaf in Bolivia but it adds The United Kingdom is worried that the exemption could lead to increases in coca production and most importantly the amount of coca that goes into the cocaine trade As a result the exemption would weaken the global effort to tackle the drugs trade The right of indigenous people in South Americas 6 Andean region to chew coca leaf was removed in 1964 when Bolivia was under a dictatorship and it signed up to the convention But Bolivia was given 25 years to implement the ban This arrangement came to an end in 1989 and since then the issue has been under dispute In 2011 Bolivia whose President Evo Morales 7 is a former coca producer formally told the UN that it did not want to be in the convention any more It has now signed up to the convention again but with an exemption so that its indigenous people can continue chewing coca leaves The exemption is the first of its kind in the 8 history of UN drugcontrol treaties and has led to concerns that other countries may apply for exemptions The Russian government has argued that the exemption will lead to an increase in illegal circulation of cocaine and warned that it also sets a dangerous precedent that could be used by other states in creating a more liberal drugcontrol regime The British parliament has recommended that 9 Bolivias request should be supported by the UK government It argues that it is important that countries stay in the convention Bolivias

121,Some cities have pigeons Lima has black vultures or gallinazos They circle in groups overhead and perch on the citys most emblematic buildings the decrepit colonialera churches and crumbling eighteenthcentury piles in the city centre In many ways with their wrinkly heads and beady eyes they remind Lima residents of the side of their city they would rather ignore the neglect poverty and filth But these carrioneaters natural affinity for dead and decaying things is being turned into a virtue Environmental authorities are giving these muchmaligned birds a PR makeover kitting them out with GoPro action video cameras and GPS trackers and giving them a new mission in the fight against flytipping and illegal dumping Samuel is one of the projects ten certified diseasefree Coragyps atratus that have been charged with doing what they do best sniffing out rubbish Fitted with his tracker he is set free above the city where he identifies clandestine dumps and records the GPS coordinates on a live map His trainer at Limas Huachipa Zoo Alfredo Correa beams with admiration They can eat dead animals because their metabolism protects them from viruses and bacteria he says Theyve got some of the strongest gut flora in the natural world The effort is a collaboration between USAID and the Peruvian Environment Ministry to tackle Limas rubbish problem Samuels other airborne companions have been given more evocative names Capitan Huggin Capitan Fenix named after the mythological creature that rises from the ashes and Capitana Aella Whirlwind A tonguein cheek video adds a melodramatic voiceover in which the noble carthatidae lineage the vultures are pitted against pestilence and disease while humanity is placidly ignoring the danger The project makes a serious point With just four landfills in a city of nearly ten million inhabitants there are countless illegal dumps A fifth of the rubbish ends up there according to the Environment Ministry Runoff from the waste contaminates Limas main water source the Rimac river as well as the Chillon and Lurin rivers which flow into the Bay of Lima The environmental supervision agency OEFA says that three poorer neighbourhoods despite having only 12 of Limas population have by far the most flytipped rubbish Villa Maria del Triunfo 394 Villa El Salvador 253 and El Agustino 183 The problem in part is unpaid taxes Many residents especially in the barrios just dont pay That means some of the 43 district municipalities lack the resources for basic services such as rubbish collection It also means nobody is necessarily going to clean up where the vultures identify illegal rubbish We share the vultures GPS coordinates with the municipalities says Javier Hernandez the project director Its their job to collect the rubbish and to try and change the habits of their residents The project aims to encourage citizens to be vultures on the ground to report flytipping cut back on their own waste and recycle Some residents are responding posting photos of illicit dumps on the Twitter feed and Facebook page The idea was hatched at the 2014 United Nations Climate Change Conference hosted in Lima We were looking for ways to involve not just the authorities but also citizens to generate environmental awareness Hernandez says Artist Cristina Planas had placed huge sculpted vulture heads on top of 25 dead palm trees in a wetland reserve in the south of the city Rich residents hated it as an ugly imposition but Planas invited citizens to adopt a vulture in support of conservation and recycling We are a little scared of the vultures appearance she said But in reality he is out there sacrificing himself for us He is out there recycling in the last place we threw out our rubbish,Some cities have

50,The beginning of the year is probably primetime for feeling glum about work its ages until the next holiday and its dark in the morning and when you get home And if youre stuck in a job you dont like it could be enough to have you reaching for your CV But before you start hunting through the job ads try to put things in perspective So what else could you be doing instead We asked fi ve people doing some unusual jobs how much they are paid what the worst parts are and why they enjoy their work 1 Dogfood taster The job Tasting dog food to make sure it meets a premium brands quality standards What it involves Opening sample tins of each freshly made batch of dog or cat food smelling it and eating it Although dogs palates are different from ours taste is an important quality check to ensure each different ingredient is perfectly balanced in just the right way says Philip Wells the chief taster for Lilys Kitchen pet food Trying the food is also a good way to pick up on the nuances of the cooking this works especially well on the dry food Typical salary 20000 for an entrylevel job in the quality department However Wells says 50000 or more is easily achievable for an experienced technical director who as well as tasting products is also likely to be responsible for developing new recipes and advising the business on technical and regulatory matters Worst part of the job The deadlines for Wells who admits he quite likes the food The meat used in pet food has to be derived from animals passed as fi t for human consumption under the Animal Feed Regulations 2010 and he says the fi rm uses humangrade freshly prepared raw food in its recipes He adds There are some pretty gruesome pet foods out there and although I dont taste them the smell is enough to turn the stomach when I do a bit of market research Job satisfaction No two days are ever the same Its rewarding Wells says that a project he has worked on will help pets to become happier and healthier However he acknowledges that some of the credit must go to another key member of the tasting team Lily the border terrier 2 Hygiene technician The job Disinfecting areas that have potentially been exposed to biohazardous situations What it involves Cleaning up crime scenes road accidents and suicides Clearing hoarders houses full of rubbish rats and excrement among other things The job is about keeping people safe says Richard Lewis a hygiene technician for Rentokil We deal with some very disturbingly dirty sites Typical salary The entrylevel salary is usually around 14500 and a top salary can be up to 22000 Worst part of the job Cleaning up after suicides You get used to the job being disgusting but the emotional side of it is still hard You learn not to take your work home with you he says You also need to have a sense of humour as some days can be tough Job satisfaction Lewis fi nds the variety of tasks exciting One day Im cleaning up after a dead body another day Im in a prison cell or 100 feet in the air being lowered down into a silo to clean it He also takes pride in the transformation he brings about Its satisfying to return a potentially hazardous site back to a safe environment And it benefi ts society 3 Biogas engineer The job Setting up biogas plants in developing countries What it involves Linking a system of digesters which can be fi lled with human excrement animal dung and other waste products to toilets to produce a biogas that can be used for cooking and lighting You have to know what size and shape the mixing pit needs to be how to create the optimum temperature for digestion and where to situate the biogas plant says Baburam Paudel chief technical offi cer in Nepal for the charity Renewable World You also have to convince poor communities that poo can be productive many are repelled by the idea of connecting their toilets to their kitchens Typical salary An entrylevel salary is around 10000 while a typical salary for a chief technical offi cer is 30000 Worst part of the job For Paudel its seeing people struggling to survive on very little income But he admits anyone who wont change a nappy would struggle You have to be willing to get your hands dirty during the build process and inspections Unsurprisingly the anaerobic digestion the process that takes place when bacteria eat the decomposing waste and produce methane smells like rotten eggs It can be disgusting and there is no room for mistakes Job satisfaction I fi nd it immensely satisfying to know that I am helping people to increase their incomes and allowing girls to attend school by replacing the need to collect fi rewood says Paudel My work improves the health and hygiene of whole communities 4 Eel ecologist The job Conserving the critically endangered European eel What it involves To monitor the size of the endangered eels ecologists wade into the Thames and other London rivers and marshes full of eels sometimes up to their armpits and reach into a net fi lled with up to 20 adult eels to grab one with their bare hands Adult eels can be a metre long or even larger and weigh up to 2kg Theyre not at all dangerous but they are almost pure muscle and they can be a little bit slimy says Stephen Mowat an eel conservationist and ecologist for the Zoological Society of London We have to weigh and measure them and they wriggle a lot Its diffi cult to look professional while crawling on the ground chasing an eel across the grass Worst part of the job Eels are really tricky creatures to work with and getting outsmarted by an eel can be quite embarrassing says Mowat You also have to be ready to jump from one project to the next I once had to dissect a tub of dead eels to examine parasites living in them moments before jumping into a suit for a meeting with government offi cials I remembered to wash my hands But for Mowat the worst part of the job is defi nitely not handling the eels he believes baby eels known as elvers are as cute as pandas The worst thing about the job is regularly learning how much damage we the British population are doing to the environment Job satisfaction Getting to work outdoors and seeing British wildlife up close is the best part of the job says Mowat Eels are beautiful creatures and working with eels doesnt just benefi t the eel it helps whole river systems estuaries and coastal habitats That is something worth working on 5 Shopping channel presenter The job Selling and demonstrating a wide range of products on live TV What it involves Presenting hours and hours of monotonous content while simultaneously

wildlife population that showed a dramatic reduction in numbers across countless species The LPI showed the number of vertebrates had declined by 52 over four decades Biodiversity loss has now reached critical levels Some populations of mammals birds reptiles and amphibians have suffered even bigger losses with freshwater species declining by 76 over the same period But its the creatures that provide the most natural capital or ecosystem services that are getting many scientists really worried Three quarters of the worlds food production is thought to depend on bees and other pollinators such as hoverflies Never mind how cute a panda is or how stunning a tiger its worms that are grinding up our waste and taking it deep into the soil to turn into nutrients and bats that are catching mosquitoes and keeping malaria rates down A study in North America has valued the loss of pest control from ongoing bat declines at more than 22bn in lost agricultural productivity Its the loss of the common species that will impact on people not so much the rarer creatures because by the very nature of their rarity were not reliant on them in such an obvious way said Dr Nick Isaac a macroecologist at the Centre for Ecology Hydrology in Oxfordshire He says that recent work he and colleagues have been doing suggests that Britains insects and other invertebrates are declining just as fast as vertebrates with serious consequences for humanity The really interesting thing about this work is that we are learning that it s not just about the numbers of species going extinct but the actual numbers in a population that s the beginning of a fundamental shift in our understanding he says He pointed to the fact that between 23 and 36 of all birds mammals and amphibians used for food or medicine are now threatened with extinction In many parts of the world wildanimal food sources are a critical part of the diet particularly for the poor The blame most agree sits with unsustainable human consumption damaging ecosystems creating climate change and destroying habitats at a far faster rate than previously thought But this time its not just the big cuddly mammals we have to worry about losing but the smaller less visible creatures upon which we depend insects creepycrawlies and even worms They might not be facing immediate extinction but a decline in their numbers will affect us all We are going to feel the impact of those losses With the UK species the pattern is much the same with invertebrates as it is with vertebrates Its not as simplistic as fish die and people starve its more complex said Isaac Humans said TV naturalist Sir David Attenborough in 2013 are a plague on earth but WWF claims there is still time to stop the rot Its UK Chief Executive David Nussbaum said The scale of the destruction highlighted in this report should act as a wakeup call for us all We all politicians business and people have an interest and a responsibility to act to ensure we protect what we all value a healthy future for people and nature Humans are cutting down trees more quickly than they can regrow harvesting more fish than the oceans can restock pumping water from our rivers and aquifers faster than rainfall can replenish them and emitting more carbon than the oceans and forests can absorb he said,We have all become familiar with wildlife emergencies such as the threatened extinction of the tiger in India the orangutan in Indonesia and the panda They are wellloved animals that no one wants to see disappear But now scientists fear the real impact of declining wildlife could be closer to home they believe the threat to creatures such as ladybirds is a much greater danger to biodiversity Climate change falling numbers of animals rising numbers of humans and

106,DNA taken from the wisdom tooth of a European huntergatherer has given scientists an unprecedented glimpse of modern humans before the rise of farming The Mesolithic man who lived in Spain around 7000 years ago had an unusual mix of blue eyes black or brown hair and dark skin according to analyses of his genetic makeup He was probably lactose intolerant and had more difficulty digesting starchy foods than the farmers who transformed diets and lifestyles when they took up tools in the first agricultural revolution The invention of farming brought humans and animals into much closer contact and humans likely evolved more robust immune systems to fend off infections that the animals passed on But scientists may have overestimated the impact farming had in shaping the human immune system because tests on the huntergatherers DNA found that he already carried mutations that boost the immune system to tackle various nasty bugs Some live on in modern Europeans today Before we started this work I had some ideas of what we were going to find said Carles LaluezaFox who led the study at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona Most of those ideas turned out to be completely wrong The Spanish team started their work after a group of cavers stumbled upon two skeletons in a deep and complex cave system high up in the Cantabrian Mountains of northwest Spain in 2006 The human remains which belonged to two men in their early 30s had been extremely well preserved by the cool environment of the cave Carbon dating put the remains at around 7000 years old before farming had swept into Europe from the Middle East The timing fitted with ancient artefacts found at the site including perforated reindeer teeth that were strung and hung from the peoples clothing The scientists focused their efforts on the better preserved of the two skeletons After several failed attempts they managed to reconstruct the mans entire genome from DNA found in the root of a third molar It is the first time researchers have obtained the complete genome of a modern European who lived before the Neolithic revolution The DNA threw up a series of surprises When LaluezaFox looked at the genome he found that rather than having light skin the man had gene variants that tend to produce much darker skin This guy had to be darker than any modern European but we dont know how dark the scientist said Another surprise finding was that the man had blue eyes That was unexpected said LaluezaFox because the mutation for blue eyes was thought to have arisen more recently than the mutations that cause lighter skin colour The results suggest that blue eye colour came first in Europe with the transition to lighter skin ongoing through Mesolithic times On top of the scientific impact artists might have to rethink their drawings of the people You see a lot of reconstructions of these people hunting and gathering and they look like modern Europeans with light skin You never see a reconstruction of a Mesolithic huntergatherer with dark skin and blue eye colour LaluezaFox said The Spanish team went on to compare the genome of the huntergatherer to those of modern Europeans from different regions to see how they might be related They found that the ancient DNA most closely matched the genetic makeup of people living in northern Europe in particular Sweden and Finland The discovery of mutations that bolstered the immune system against bacteria and viruses suggests that the shift to a farming culture in Neolithic times did not drive all of the changes in immunity genes that Europeans carry today At least some of those genetic changes have a history that stretches further back One thing we dont know is what sort of pathogens were affecting these people said LaluezaFox Martin Jones professor of archaeological science at Cambridge University said the immunity genes were the most striking result There is a no doubt oversimplified grand narrative that the move from a huntergatherer lifestyle to settled farming was initially bad for our health A number of factors contributed particularly living closely together with other humans and animals shrinking the food web and crowding out water supplies The authors are drawing attention to the role of pathogens in preagricultural lives and that is interesting,DNA taken from the wisdom tooth of a European

148,The customer next to you in the queue looks innocent enough But instead of a shopping list you notice shes carrying handwritten notes about the appearance and cleanliness of the store Shes been timing the progression of the queue on her phone and is that a tiny camera lens peeking out from her purse The odds are youve just spotted a mystery shopper There are approximately 50000 mystery shopping trips carried out every month in the UK according to the Mystery Shopping Providers Association and as more and more spending takes place online the demand for mystery shoppers is growing Retailers are becoming increasingly aware that shoppers who are prepared to set foot in a physical store want a service and an experience they cant get online says Simon Boydell spokesman for Marketforce which has more than 300000 mystery shoppers on its books Our clients want to measure how well their stores are delivering on that experience We assign different store locations to each shopper and rotate them so that they never go back to the same shop within three months says Jill Spencer of mystery shopping company ABa Each day they typically spend up to eight hours visiting ve to ten stores plus another hour or two ling detailed reports on every aspect of their visit For that the mystery shoppers can earn up to 155 a day They are also reimbursed for their petrol and hotel stays and compensated for their car depreciation the shoppers can be expected to drive as many as 20000 miles a year Meanwhile video mystery shoppers who lm their visits with a hidden camera planted in a buttonhole or handbag can earn even more around 300 a day Shoppers are usually repaid any money they spend in the stores and may also be allowed to keep the products they buy Im typically given between 5 and 20 to spend at each store to assess the service I receive at the till says Laura a 50yearold mystery shopper from Devon who has been paid to visit around 7000 shops since 2001 The purchase usually has to be related to a service or a type of product that the retailer wants her to check Im always given a scenario such as buying something from a speci c department or a new product range but within that framework I can often buy whatever I want and keep it Like most fulltime mystery shoppers Laura is selfemployed taking jobs from ABa and other mystery shopping companies as and when they come up Her income is typically 30000 to 40000 a year and that doesnt include all the freebies she gets on the job With the perks its enough to live on But I dont do it because I love shopping In fact I hate shopping now When Im not working it pains me to have to go out and buy a pint of milk She does however nd it satisfying to return to a store she has previously mystery shopped and see standards have improved I know it must be because of my feedback or why would they pay me to give it Some of the retailers I shop at win awards for customer service and I think that is down to us mystery shoppers I feel Im not just doing a service to my company Im doing a service to all shoppers everywhere Sadly regular mystery shopping assignments that pay like Lauras are few and far between In fact competition is so erce she keeps her job a closely guarded secret and even her friends and family dont know who she works for Laura is not her real name Its estimated that more than 500000 people have registered as mystery shoppers in the UK but just 10 or less manage to get regular work each month and this has led to a dramatic reduction in compensation Where once you got a fee reimbursement for your purchase and mileage you now often just receive a contribution towards a purchase say Val a 51yearold former mystery shopper I worked for 40 different mystery shopping companies for almost 20 years but I gave up entirely three years ago because I had bills to pay and very few assignments paid what I considered to be an acceptable rate Nowadays mystery shopping companies mostly rely on the promise of freebies to incentivize their workers Marketforce shoppers typically get a couple of pounds for a visit as a token gesture for their time and effort says Boydell At the most well pay 15 to 25 plus reimbursement for say a meal for two or a hotel stay We dont directly employ any shoppers so we dont have to pay them the minimum wage Id go on a cruise for nothing says Laura But I think mystery shopping companies that pay you a nominal fee to travel to a restaurant and eat a meal are exploiting people I wont touch those jobs anymore There are plenty of people however that would Hannah a 41yearold City lawyer has conducted nearly 500 visits for the Mystery Dining Company in her spare time without receiving remuneration or travel expenses As a prestigious

Ascot and overnight stays at boutique hotels But theres no such thing as a free lunch even if you work for a mystery dining company Hannah says she typically spends two to four hours after each visit writing detailed reports on everything from the quality of the food to speci c interactions with staff whom she always needs to be able to name or subtly describe Trickiest of all she must memorize all these details while eating her meal unable of course to openly write anything down Theres lots to remember and sometimes it can detract from the experience Youre expected to give feedback while

21,The Moroccan city of Ouarzazate is used to big productions On the edge of the Sahara Desert and at the centre of the North African countrys Ouallywood lm industry it has played host to bigbudget location shots in Lawrence of Arabia The Mummy The Living Daylights and even Game of Thrones Now the trading city nicknamed the door of the desert is the location for another blockbuster a complex of four linked solar megaplants which alongside hydro and wind will help provide nearly half of Moroccos electricity from renewables by 2020 with it is hoped some spare to export to Europe The project is a key plank in Moroccos ambitions to use its untapped deserts to become a global solar superpower When the full complex is complete it will be the largest concentrated solar power plant in the world and the rst phase called Noor 1 will go live in November 2015 The mirror technology it uses is less widespread and more expensive than the photovoltaic panels that are now familiar on roofs the world over but it will have the advantage of being able to continue producing power even after the sun goes down The potential for solar power from the desert has been known for decades In the days after the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986 the German particle physicist Gerhard Knies calculated that the worlds deserts receive enough energy in a few hours to provide for humanitys power needs for a whole year The challenge though has been capturing that energy and transporting it to the population centres where it is required As engineers put the nishing touches to Noor 1 its 500000 crescentshaped solar mirrors glitter across the desert skyline The 800 rows follow the sun as it tracks across the heavens whirring quietly every few minutes as their shadows slip further east When they are nished the four plants at Ouarzazate will occupy a space as big as Moroccos capital city Rabat and generate 580 megawatts MW of electricity enough to power a million homes Noor 1 itself has a generating capacity of 160MW Moroccos Environment Minister Hakima elHaite believes that solar energy could have the same impact on the region this century that oil production had in the last But the 9bn project to make her countrys deserts boom was triggered by more immediate concerns she said We are not an oil producer We import 94 of our energy as fossil fuels from abroad and that has big consequences for our state budget elHaite told the Guardian We also used to subsidize fossil fuels which have a heavy cost so when we heard about the potential of solar energy we thought Why not Solar energy will make up a third of Moroccos renewable energy supply by 2020 with wind and hydro taking the same share each We are very proud of this project elHaite said I think it is the most important solar plant in the world Each parabolic mirror is 12 metres high and focused on a steel pipeline carrying a heat transfer solution HTF that is warmed to 393C as it snakes along the trough before coiling into a heat engine There it is mixed with water to create steam that turns energy generating turbines The HTF is made up of a synthetic thermal oil solution that is pumped towards a heat tank containing molten sands that can store heat energy for three hours allowing the plant to power homes into the night The mirrors are spaced in tier formations to minimize damage from sand blown up by desert winds Technicians say that the Noor 2 and 3 plants due to open in 2017 will store energy for up to eight hours opening the prospect of 247 solar energy in the Sahara and the surrounding region The biggest challenge we faced was being able to nish the project on time with the performance level we needed to achieve said Rashid alBayad the project director But even as the rst phase of the project nears completion Morocco is eyeing grander international ambitions We are already involved in high tension transportation lines to cover the full south of Morocco and Mauritania as a rst step says Ahmed Baroudi manager of Societe dInvestissements Energetiques the national renewable energy investment rm But he says the projects ultimate impact will go far wider even as far as the Middle East The ultimate objective given by his majesty the king is Mecca Whether that ambition is achieved remains to be seen but exporting solar energy could have stabilizing effects within and between countries according to the Moroccan solar energy agency Masen Talks are ongoing with Tunisia and energy exports northwards across the Mediterranean remain a key goal We believe that its possible to export energy to Europe but rst we would have to build the interconnectors which dont yet exist said Maha elKadiri a Masen spokeswoman Speci cally we would have to build interconnections which would not go through the existing one in Spain and then start exporting Spain has itself prohibited new solar projects because of a lack of interconnectors to transmit the energy to France The EU has set a target of ensuring that 10 of each member countrys power can be transported abroad by cable by 2020 In the meantime Morocco is focused on using solar to meet its own needs for resource independence This could one day include water desalination in a country that is increasingly being hit by drought as the climate warms Of cials are keenly aware of the running they are making in what is the most advanced renewable energy programme in the Middle East and North African region We are at the avantegarde of solar elKadiri says About 9bn has been invested in the Noor Complex much of it from international institutions such as the European Investment Bank and World Bank and backed by Moroccan government guarantees Undisclosed energy subsidies from Moroccos unelected ruler King Mohammed VI

92,At Addis Ababa airport visitors are greeted by pictures of golden grains minute ochrered seeds and a group of men gathered around a giant pancake Billboards boast Teff the ultimate glutenfree crop Ethiopia is one of the worlds poorest countries well known for its precarious food security situation But it is also the native home of teff a highly nutritious ancient grain increasingly finding its way into healthfood shops and supermarkets in Europe and America Teffs tiny seeds the size of poppy seeds are high in calcium iron and protein and boast an impressive set of amino acids Naturally gluten free the grain can substitute for wheat flour in anything from bread and pasta to waffles and pizza bases Like quinoa the Andean grain teffs superb nutritional profile offers the promise of new and lucrative markets in the west In Ethiopia teff is a national obsession Grown by an estimated 63 million farmers fields of the crop cover more than 20 of all land under cultivation Ground into flour and used to make injera the spongy fermented flatbread that is basic to Ethiopian cuisine the grain is central to many religious and cultural ceremonies Across the country and in neighbouring Eritrea diners gather around large pieces of injera which doubles as cutlery scooping up stews and feeding one another as a sign of loyalty or friendship a tradition known as gursha Outside diaspora communities in the west teff has flown under the radar for decades But a growing appetite for traditional crops and booming healthfood and glutenfree markets are breathing new life into the grain increasingly touted as Ethiopias second gift to the world after coffee Sophie Kebede a Londonbased entrepreneur who owns a UK company specializing in the grain says she was flabbergasted when she discovered its nutritional value I didnt know it was so sought after I am of Ethiopian origin Ive been eating injera all my life Growing demand for socalled ancient grains has not always been a straightforward win for poor communities In Bolivia and Peru reports of rising incomes owing to the nowglobal quinoa trade have come alongside those of malnutrition and conflicts over land as farmers sell their entire crop to meet western demand Ethiopias growing middle class is also pushing up demand for teff and rising domestic prices have put the grain out of reach of the poorest Today most small farmers sell the bulk of what they grow to consumers in the city This may have helped boost incomes in some rural areas but it has had nutritional consequences says the government as teff is the most nutritionally valuable grain in the country Estimates suggest that while those in urban areas eat up to 61kg of teff a year in rural areas the figure is 20kg The type consumed differs too the wealthy almost exclusively eat the more expensive magna and white teff varieties less welloff consumers tend to eat lessvaluable red and mixed teff and more than half combine it with cheaper cereals such as sorghum and maize The Ethiopian government wants to double teff production by 2015 Its strategy published in 2013 argues that the grain could play an important role in school meals and emergency aid programmes and help reduce malnutrition particularly among children and adolescents Though Ethiopia has a fastgrowing economy it remains on the UNs list of leastdeveloped countries An estimated 20 of underfives are malnourished or suffer stunted growth The governments Agricultural Transformation Agency aims to boost yields by developing improved varieties of the grain along with new planting techniques and tools to reduce postharvest losses Government restrictions instituted in 2006 forbid the export of raw teff grain only allowing shipments of injera and other processed products But this could change the goal is to produce enough teff for domestic consumption and a strong export market according to the governments strategy Mama Fresh is a family firm that has been selling injera to top restaurants and hotels in the Ethiopian capital for years It also ships the flatbread to Finland Germany Sweden and the US primarily for consumption by diaspora communities But the company has its eye on the glutenfree market It aims to double exports to America in 2014 and will soon start producing teffbased pizzas bread and cookies Typically these products are going to go through many hands before they reach the shelves of Sainsburys or wherever There are profit margins at every step and small farmers are not necessarily well placed to bargain with the bigger traders says David Hallam trade and markets director at the UNs Food and Agriculture Organization He sees quinoas popularity as a cautionary tale of how export opportunities can be a mixed blessing for poor countries Regassa Feyissa an Ethiopian agricultural scientist and former head of the National Institute for Biodiversity warns that without careful planning increased teff production for export may displace other important crops for farmers And efforts to boost production could benefit business interests at the expense of small farmers With little Ethiopian teff on the international market farmers in the US have started planting the crop Farmers in Europe Israel and Australia have also experimented with it Kebede says she gets her grain from farms in southern Europe though she would prefer to source it from Ethiopia Teff is second nature to an Ethiopian so who better to supply it We have this soughtafter grain being grown in the country so why cant an Ethiopian farmer benefit from this,At Addis Ababa airport visitors are greeted by pictures of golden grains tiny red seeds and a group of men around a giant pancake The words say Teff the ultimate glutenfree crop Ethiopia is one of the worlds poorest countries well known for its difficult food situation But it is also the home of teff a highly nutritious ancient grain that is now being sold in healthfood shops and supermarkets in Europe and America Teffs tiny seeds the size of poppy seeds are high in calcium iron and protein and also amino acids Naturally gluten free the grain can be used instead of wheat flour in anything from bread and pasta to waffles and pizza bases Like quinoa the Andean grain teffs superb nutritional profile offers the promise of new and lucrative markets in the west In Ethiopia teff is a national obsession Grown by around 63 million farmers fields of the crop cover more than 20 of all farmland It is ground into flour and used to make injera the flatbread that is basic to Ethiopian cooking The grain is also central to many religious and cultural ceremonies Across the country and in neighbouring Eritrea people gather around large pieces of injera which is also used as cutlery scooping up stews and feeding one another as a sign of loyalty or friendship a tradition known as gursha The growing appetite for traditional crops and the booming healthfood and glutenfree markets are breathing new life into the grain which is increasingly being called Ethiopias second gift to the world after coffee Sophie Kebede a Londonbased businesswoman who owns a UK company specializing in the grain says she was flabbergasted when she discovered its nutritional value I didnt know it was so sought after I am of Ethiopian origin Ive been eating injera all my life Growing demand for socalled ancient grains has not always been a simple positive for poor communities In Bolivia and Peru there are reports of rising incomes from the nowglobal quinoa trade but also malnutrition and conflicts over land as farmers sell their entire crop to meet western demand Ethiopias growing middle class is also increasing demand for teff and rising prices have made the grain too expensive for the poorest people Today most small farmers sell most of what they grow to people in the city This may have helped boost incomes in some rural areas but it has had nutritional consequences says the government as teff is the most nutritionally valuable grain in the country In urban areas people eat up to 61kg of teff a year In rural areas the figure is 20kg The type of teff people eat is different too the rich eat the more expensive magna and white teff varieties poorer people usually eat lessvaluable red and mixed teff and more than half combine it with cheaper cereals such as sorghum and maize The Ethiopian government wants to double teff production by 2015 It says that the grain could play an important role in school meals and emergency aid programmes and help reduce malnutrition particularly among children and adolescents Though Ethiopia has a fastgrowing economy it remains on the UNs list of leastdeveloped countries An estimated 20 of underfives are malnourished The governments Agricultural Transformation Agency aims to boost crops by developing improved varieties of the grain and introducing new planting techniques and tools The government does not allow the export of raw teff grain only of injera and other processed products But this could change the goal is to produce enough teff for Ethiopia and for export Mama Fresh is a family company that has been selling injera to top restaurants and hotels in the Ethiopian capital for years It also exports the flatbread to Finland Germany Sweden and the US mostly for Ethiopians who live there But the company wants to double exports to America in 2014 and will soon start producing teffbased pizzas bread and cookies Regassa Feyissa an Ethiopian agricultural scientist and former head of the National Institute for Biodiversity warns that without careful planning increased teff production for export may mean that farmers do not grow other important crops With not much Ethiopian teff on the

126,The roof is plastic held up by a crooked tree trunk and the desks just a jumble of castoff chairs but the students inside the Chemin des Dunes school are studying with the same intensity you would find in a seminar at Oxford University At stake is the hope of a new life in France The French language is very difficult but we try hard If we come every day maybe we can touch our dreams says Kamal a refugee from Sudans wartorn Darfur district who comes to three or four hours of classes every day Its a good thing to keep your brain active The 29yearold electrical engineer is one of dozens perhaps hundreds of refugees living in the jungle camp outside Calais who have applied for asylum in France and are eager to learn the language of what they hope will be their new home Like many of his fellow students he is frustrated that media coverage of the sprawling tentvillage has focused only on those who use it as a staging post for risky nightly bids to sneak on board crossChannel lorries or trains I need to tell people in the UK they think that everyone wants to go there But there are a lot of people here who want to stay in France Kamal said France is already home to more than a quarter of a million refugees according to United Nations data the country has taken in more than twice as many as the UK even though the countries have similar populations There are a further 56000 asylum seekers waiting for their claim to a French safe haven to be processed the second highest number in Europe while in the UK there are 36000 While the applicants wait for an answer though France does not provide them with any financial support or allow them to work and the slow process can take many months The jungle camp offers a free meal a day and a plastic roof over their heads so many decide to endure the basic conditions for a few extra months rather than potentially jeopardize their asylum bid by working illegally The idea for the school was first touted by some of that group at the start of the summer when they were bored with sitting around waiting and nervous about starting a new life in France totally unable to communicate It was a reality within weeks opening on 11 July We did it to reunite the brothers and at the same time they can learn French said Zimarco Jones the schools Nigerian founder who arrived in Calais in 2013 and is still waiting for his asylum claim to be processed Now we need to build another one he says with a grin At its busiest the tiny classroom holds 30 pupils crammed into five rows of desks in front of a big green chalkboard and pictures of cartoon animals for each letter of the French alphabet There are also classes in English art and tai chi but the biggest draw is the French lessons provided by volunteers from Calais and beyond French is not as easy as English but two weeks ago I decided there was no way to get to the UK says George another Darfur refugee and dedicated student He wanted to cross the Channel because he speaks fluent English but with language classes he says he is happy to settle in France Anywhere there is peace I can stay no problem he says already waiting at the classroom more than half an hour before his teachers arrive He admits he doesnt know much about France but says that the classes are slowly helping him understand the country as well as the language Many of the volunteers at the jungle school are local teachers who are giving up their summer holidays Jenny Flahaut 33 who works at a childrens home was inspired to volunteer after seeing an advertisement on Facebook I saw these people in Calais every day and I wanted to do something for them she said She is particularly frustrated by the depiction of migrants in the media and by politicians who have never visited the camp most recently David Cameron the British prime minister who in a much criticized speech talked about swarms of people trying to reach the UK They dont know them and have a bad vision but they are not like that Flahaut said as she prepared for an afternoon lesson Most of them are very good people They are welcoming and friendly They want to improve their life and make it better and learning is part of that The teachers and Zimarco are focused now on setting up a separate classroom to serve around 200 women and two dozen children The women are outnumbered around ten to one by men in the Calais encampment and most feel uncomfortable attending classes with male students they dont know the volunteers say When that is finished the former hotel worker whose work getting the school off the ground is remembered in its unofficial name everyone in the camp just calls it Zimarcos school has more dreams for making the camp a place to live not just survive He wants to set up a football team for migrants he explains over an instant cappuccino in the immaculate tent he calls home and even dreams of changing the camp name He hates the jungle because he says it implies the residents arent people We have a discotheque a house a mosque a school shops he says We are not animals,The roof is plastic and the desks are just old chairs but the students inside the Chemin des Dunes school are studying

66,They may not know who Steve Jobs was or even how to tie their own shoelaces but the average sixyearold child understands more about digital technology than a 45yearold adult according to an authoritative new report The advent of broadband in the year 2000 has created a generation of digital natives Ofcom which checks standards in the UK communications industries says in its annual study of British consumers Born in the new millennium these children have never known the dark ages of dialup internet and the youngest are learning how to operate smartphones or tablets before they are able to talk These younger people are shaping communications said Jane Rumble Ofcoms media research head As a result of growing up in the digital age they are developing fundamentally different communication habits from older generations even compared to what we call the early adopters the 16to24 age group Ofcom devised a digital quotient or DQ test to put 800 children and 2000 adults through their paces which rather than measuring intelligence as an IQ test would attempts to gauge awareness of and selfcon dence around gadgets from tablets to smart watches knowledge of superfast internet 4G mobile phone networks and mobile apps Among 6 to 7yearolds who have grown up with YouTube Spotify music streaming and online television the average DQ score was 98 higher than for those aged between 45 and 49 who scored an average of 96 Digital understanding peaks between 14 and 15 years of age when the average is a DQ of 113 and then drops gradually throughout adulthood before falling rapidly in old age People are now being invited to test their digital knowledge with an abbreviated version of the questionnaire that will give any member of the public a DQ score along with advice on how to improve their understanding and protect themselves and their families online The ways in which millennial children contact each other and consume entertainment are so different from previous generations that forecasters now consider their preferences a better indication of the future than those of trendsetting young adults The most remarkable change is in time spent talking on the phone Two decades ago teenagers devoted their evenings to monopolizing the home telephone line dissecting love affairs and friendships in conversations that lasted for hours For those aged 12 to 15 phone calls account for just 3 of time spent communicating through any device For all adults this rises to 20 and for young adults it is still three times as high at 9 Todays children do the majority of their remote socializing by sending written messages or through shared photographs and videos The millennium generation is losing its voice Ofcom claims Over 90 of their devicetime is

other social sites The rest of their viewing is shared between DVDs streamed content through Net ix or iTunes and recorded television programmes Young adults aged 16 to 24 are voracious consumers of almost all media However live radio and printbased media have all but disappeared from their daily diet Younger people are moving away from live television and moving to streaming and catch up

and simple touchbased interfaces tablets are being credited with a jump in internet access among the over65s For years there has been a very stubborn resistance by the over65s to accessing the internet said James Thickett Research Director at Ofcom In the last three years we have seen that change and we think thats down to tablets Britain is embracing internetenabled devices across the generations to the extent that the balance between sleep and screenbased activities has now tipped The typical adult spends eight hours and 41 minutes each day communicating or consuming media

43,Europe is to become the first place in the world to force realworld emissions tests on car makers opening up a new front in the fight to tackle air pollution New regulations will introduce the tests to reveal what cars emissions are like when driving on roads and in traffic rather than in ideal laboratorylike conditions as is currently the case Green lit by European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans the tests are designed to enforce a limit of 80mg of nitrogen oxide per kilometre a level met by only one car out of 16 according to researchers Other countries such as China and Korea which are also considering realworld emissions tests will be watching what happens next closely Pollutants from diesel engines such as nitrogen oxide carbon monoxide and particulates are thought to be responsible for at least one quarter of the 29000 annual pollutionrelated deaths in the UK alone That figure is likely to rise when the committee on the medical effects of air pollutants publishes what it calls strengthening evidence of damage to public health from nitrogen oxide emissions later in 2015 But the current New European Drive Cycle laboratory test for measuring these emissions is a quarter of a century old and has been outpaced by technological developments in the car industry Studies have shown that the results of lab techniques to measure car emissions can easily be fixed by using techniques such as taping up doors and windows to minimize air resistance driving on unrealistically smooth roads and testing at improbably high temperatures Campaigners say that car makers also use tricks such as programming vehicles to go into a low emissions mode when their front wheels are spinning and their back wheels are stationary as happens in such lab experiments The Commission is finalizing a proposal to introduce a new emissions testing procedure that will allow proper assessment of the vehicles in real driving said Lucia Caudet a Commission spokesperson The proposal still needs approval from other commissioners and a technical committee but we dont expect any major internal hurdles a European Union EU source added One key reason why air pollution kills 400000 citizens annually is that car makers cheat the tests for diesel cars causing many times more pollution on the road said Greg Archer the clean vehicles manager for Transport and Environment The development of a new realworld driving emission test is an important step forward in tackling urban air pollution EU states should now support the Commissions proposals and ignore the whingeing from car makers that the rules are too tough According to research by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2014 actual nitrogen oxide emissions from cars are seven times higher than the 80mgkm standard with some models running at 22 times above the recommended limit Only one car out of 16 met the 80g target Around one third of all nitrogen oxide pollution comes from road transport mostly diesel and in urban areas concentrations can rise as high as 64 European Environment Agency figures indicate Campaigners say that the car industry has tried to delay reforms to car test cycles but industry groups deny this arguing that a fiveyear leadtime is necessary for technical and economic reasons Real Driving Emissions RDE is a totally new regulation that will force significant emission control hardware changes that may be demanded in the middle of a vehicles production lifetime said Cara McLaughlin a spokesperson for the European Automobile Manufacturers Association ACEA However ACEA fully accepts that RDE will apply to new types of cars from September 2017 In an unusual move the car association sent Timmermans a draft regulation of their own for him to consider after EU representatives finally agreed a regulation to implement the nitrogen oxide limits with beefedup road trials and strict monitoring of exhaust fumes ACEAs draft regulation would have covered fewer pollutants and further delayed the regulations phased introduction until 2020 Test distances would have been shortened from 1300m to below 700m minimum temperatures would have been raised from 7C to 3C and more rural roads would have been used The lobbyists were all over this Archer said This was a real attempt at subversion of the legislative process After Timmermans apparent rejection of the ACEA proposal the regulation will now pass to commissioners for a rubber stamp and member states for final amendments before an expected introduction in September By 2017 the first realworld car emissions tests are expected to begin in earnest With a similar battle already looming over the testing of CO2 emissions for cars at the end of 2015 and with comparable debates in other countries the introduction of the EUs new emissions tests will be watched closely,In an attempt to reduce air pollution Europe will become the first part of the world to force car makers to use realworld emissions tests New regulations will introduce the tests to reveal what cars emissions are like when driving on roads and in traffic not in ideal laboratorylike conditions which is what happens at the moment The tests which have been approved by the European Commission are designed to enforce a limit of 80mg of nitrogen oxide per kilometre a level that only one car in 16 meets Other

high temperatures The Commission wants to introduce a new emissions testing procedure that will allow proper assessment of the vehicles in real driving said Lucia Caudet a Commission spokesperson One

117,James Hamblin senior editor of American magazine The Atlantic recently joined the unwashed masses As part of his series If Our Bodies Could Talk Hamblin a relatively sane looking man took on a noshowering challenge to examine the effect of overcleansing the body He reduced the number of showers he had and eliminated shampoo and soap when he did In doing so he discovered what thousands of others have the more we fervently try to clean ourselves with soaps body washes and those silly little body polishers the harder our skin works to restore equilibrium encouraging us to begin the whole bewildering process again Showering strips the skin of its own oil and bacteria which many would argue is the whole point of showering but apparently this sometimes works a little too well especially when you add hot water and cleansing products to the mix You know that feeling after a shower when you feel like youre stuck in a skin suit two sizes too small Thats because much of your skins natural moisture has been washed down the drain Additionally our skin much like our gut plays host to millions of bene cial bacteria Showering destroys these happy bacterial colonies theyre completely wiped out by all of our frequent rubbing and scrubbing And when the bacteria washed off by soap repopulate they tend to favour microbes which produce an odour yes toofrequent showering may actually make you smell more When you stop showering and using soap however your skin goes through an initial likely gross adjustment period after which the skin typically restores balance oil production slows and healthy bacteria ourish After everything was said and done Hamblin realized what other nosoapnoshower devotees have known for years that the human body functioning on its own is actually quite lovely Its not just scent or aesthetics either although dermatologists suggest that slowing down on soap use can improve acne and eczema Reducing the frequency of showers and the number of cleansing products used has very real implications for our environment The average shower lasts seven minutes and uses 65 litres of water Thats 65 litres of clean drinkable water that were infusing with soap and washing down the drain each and every day sometimes more than once The vital importance of clean water is becoming harder and harder to ignore as California enters another summer of drought Its becoming clear that clean water is one of the worlds most valuable commodities and one that will soon be in short supply Add in the environmental effect of all those body wash bottles and youve got yourself a handful of very compelling reasons to let your body go au naturel If this whole thing is giving you the heebiejeebies as you recall the last time you were cheek by jowl with those who evidently already skimp on the showers and have clearly not reached the scentfree stage yet relax Many cleansing reduction enthusiasts still use deodorant if they nd it necessary everyones natural scent varies in intensity and can be affected by a host of factors including diet hydration and exercise and handwashing with soap is still recommended as a vital way to reduce the spread of infectious diseases

came to be listed for sale through his gallery announced that the piece along with a second work by the secretive British street artist had been withdrawn He would not give a reason but community leaders in Haringey who led a vocal campaign to stop the sale of the artwork that was prised from the wall of a Poundland in Wood Green were jubilant One of our two demands was that it doesnt sell and the other was that we get it back again so were halfway there said Alan Strickland a Haringey councillor I will be writing to the auction house as a matter of urgency to clarify what happened and what will happen next but for now we are really pleased that because of the pressure and the strong views of the people of Wood Green a community campaign in London has had an impact in the US Its a real victory for the people Claire Kober Leader of Haringey Council wrote to Arts Council England and the Mayor of Miami Toms Regalado to ask them to intervene to stop the sale but it appears the decision to withdraw the item came from the gallery owners in consultation with their lawyers The FBI refused to confirm reports they were asked to investigate Several hours after the conclusion of the auction the auction house issued a brief statement claiming it had persuaded the owners of the two Banksys to pull them from the sale Although there are no legal issues whatsoever regarding the sale of lots six and seven by Banksy FAAM convinced its sellers to withdraw these lots from the auction About 30 potential buyers attended the sale of 106 lots listed in the catalogue for the modern contemporary and street art sale in Miamis trendy Wynwood neighbourhood The threehour auction continued with other early lots selling in excess of their asking prices Critics have accused the auction house of dealing in stolen property but Thut insisted earlier in the week that the seller who he described as a well known collector was the rightful owner and that the sale was legal He added that his gallery had been inundated with emails and phone calls from the UK saying that many of them were abusive or offensive but said he supported the inclusion of the pieces in the sale because it would preserve them The second Banksy due to be auctioned a 2007 artwork entitled Wet Dog that was removed from a Bethlehem wall and is estimated to be worth up to 800000 disappeared from the auction houses online catalogue at lunchtime on Saturday but Slave Labour was still listed for sale right up to the 3pm start time Thut said the two pieces supplied to him by separate owners neither of them British were important works in the street art scene and deserved buyers whose first interest is in art and its preservation He said he would maintain the privacy of the collector who put it up for sale We respect our clients and their confidentiality Its not our decision to have the Banksy returned We only sell it We do not have control of it A spokesperson for Poundland said it had no idea who removed the 4ft x 5ft slab from the side of the shop it rents in Turnpike Lane Lawyers for the owner of the building a company called Wood Green Investments Ltd have refused to confirm if it had anything to do with the episode Banksy himself has not commented on the Slave Labour furore but has previously condemned those who have tried to sell his artwork speaking out before the proposed sale of five of his pieces at a 2011 auction in New York None found a buyer Stephan Keszler the dealer behind that auction believes selling Banksys works without his permission is legitimate He does something on other peoples property without asking The owner of the property can do whatever they want with it Keszler said,The controversial auction of a Banksy mural that disappeared from the wall of a north London shop was dramatically stopped just moments before it was going to be sold Slave Labour is a spraypainted artwork showing a child making British flags and is seen as a critical social commentary on last years diamond jubilee It was expected to sell for about 700000 in a sale of street and contemporary art in Florida But auctioneer Frederic Thut the owner of the Fine Arts Auction Miami art house who had refused all week to give the name of the seller announced that Slave Labour together with a second work by the secretive British street artist had been removed from sale at the auction He would not give a reason but community leaders in Haringey London who led a campaign to stop the sale of the artwork that was removed from the wall of a Poundland shop in Wood Green were extremely happy One of our two demands was that it doesnt sell and the other was that we get it back again so were halfway there said Alan Strickland a Haringey councillor I will be writing to the auction house

62,Sometimes life just isnt fair Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook and is now worth an estimated 48bn James Goodfellow also invented something used by millions of people around the world every day the cash machine but it didnt make him rich In fact he earned just 10 from the patent and has not made a penny more from it since You can imagine how I feel when I see bankers getting 1m bonuses I wonder what they contributed to the banking industry more than I did to merit a 1m bonus It doesnt make much sense to me but thats the way of the world Goodfellow says It also annoys him that hes not seen as a good role model for inventors and engineers He came up with a groundbreaking invention that generated billions of pounds and I got nothing so whos going to want to follow in James Goodfellows footsteps and get 10 if they have a fantastic success There have been arguments for years over who should of cially go down in history as the inventor of the ATM and in 2005 a man called John ShepherdBarron received a UK honour for services to banking as the inventor of the automatic cash dispenser But the UK government is now saying it was Goodfellow who invented the ATM so it would seem that after all the squabbling his place in history is now assured Back in the mid1960s Goodfellow was working as a development engineer and had been asked to devise a way to enable customers to withdraw cash from banks on Saturdays Most people working during the week couldnt get to the bank They wanted a solution The solution was a machine which would issue cash on demand to a recognized customer he recalls I set out to develop a cashissuing machine and to make this a reality I invented the PIN personal identi cation number and an associated coded token This token took the form of a plastic card with holes punched in it The patent documents proposed a system incorporating a card reader and buttons mounted in an external wall of the bank and stated When the customer wishes to withdraw a pack of banknotes from the system he simply inserts his punched card in the card reader of the system and operates the set of ten pushbuttons in accordance with his personal identification number Aside from the cards with punched holes that pretty much describes todays ATM After Goodfellow successfully demonstrated the methodology by producing a model prototypes were built and the rst machines were installed in 1967 At around the same time ShepherdBarron was developing a rival cashdispensing device His machine didnt use plastic cards instead it used cheques impregnated with carbon14 a mildly radioactive substance The machine detected the carbon14 matched the cheque against a PIN and paid out the cash It is widely accepted that the ShepherdBarron ATM was the worlds rst when it comes to being installed and used by the public the rst one at a bank in north London was opened on 27 June 1967 a month before Goodfellows ATM made its public debut However the patent for Goodfellows machine was lodged on 2 May 1966 14 months before the London ATM machine came into service The rivalry between the two men bubbled up when ShepherdBarron received an of cial honour for his achievement Goodfellow says My one big regret is that I never said anything about it until John ShepherdBarron received the OBE in 2005 This honour was granted on the basis that he was the inventor of the automatic cash dispenser That really stuck in my throat and I kicked up a bit of a fuss ShepherdBarron is no longer alive to put his case but in a 2005 interview he was fairly withering about his rival I dont know him but its clear that the difference between Goodfellow and us was that we thought through the whole system concept and that was important to the banks who bought it His invention reminds me of the hovercraft an elegant failure The cash machine has become a world conquering piece of technology and nothing the contactless revolution bitcoin wearable technology etc seems to be slowing its growth there are now 3m ATMs worldwide with the number forecast to hit 4m by 2020 Goodfellow accepts he didnt invent the concept of a cashissuing machine but I did invent a way of doing it When people talk about the Wright brothers they didnt invent the concept of ying everyone was trying to do it but they did it and got the credit for inventing the aeroplane so I think I should get the credit for inventing the cash dispenser The good news for Goodfellow is that this is now starting to happen The website ATMInventorcom concludes Who invented the idea of an ATM We believe it was Luther George Simjian Who invented the ATM as we know it We have to think it was James Goodfellow in Scotland for holding a patent date of 1966 Who invented the ATM design we recognize today We think it was John D White for Docutel in the US Even better for Goodfellow his achievement has been of cially recognized in the latest edition of a 180page guidebook called Life in the United Kingdom In the section about great British inventions of the twentieth century it states In the 1960s James Goodfellow 1937 invented the cashdispensing automatic teller machine ATM or cashpoint So after all these years Goodfellow nally nds himself being talked about in the same breath as John Logie Baird the television Alan Turing the Turing machine Sir Frank Whittle the jet engine and Sir Tim BernersLee the World Wide Web Asked what he did with the 10 he received back in the 1960s Goodfellow says he thinks he blew it on a wild night out adding It didnt change my life But he concludes its been a good

134,How long can you hold your breath Im trying it right now The rst 30 seconds are easy Im ready to give up at 45 seconds but I push on through and it seems to get easier for a while But as the second hand ticks past a minute I know Im on borrowed time My heart is pounding I let out a tiny breath and this helps Eventually I give in expelling the spent air in my lungs and taking a huge gasp And continue to gasp for a few more breaths prompting my husband to ask what on earth Im doing I manage one minute and 12 seconds Im quite impressed with myself Breathholding ability becomes extremely important in some sports particularly freediving In 2006 I was lming a programme about the anatomy and physiology of the lungs for a BBC series called slightly oddly Dont Die Young I was lucky enough to meet Sam Amps who was captain of the UK freedive team At a pool in Bristol she taught me some simple exercises to help me hold my breath for longer while swimming underwater By the end of the session I think Id managed a prodigious 90 seconds of breathholding enough to let me swim a width Sam swam three widths with ease She could hold her breath for ve minutes while swimming Five I asked how she did it very slow breathing for several minutes prior to each dive then a big deep breath before diving in She also said training helped her resist the urge to breathe for far longer than most people Some have suggested that the ability to voluntarily hold your breath is evidence of a watery episode in human evolution Its even been said that humans have an ability to lower heart rate and metabolic rate in order to breathhold for even longer Other anatomical and physiological bits and bobs our hairlessness the distribution of our subcutaneous fat and even our tendency to walk on two legs have been linked to an aquatic phase of evolutionary development Unfortunately the cobbledtogether aquatic ape hypothesis fails to hold water Its a romantic notion that may appeal to us but with the cold light of day falling on the scienti c evidence its revealed to be nothing more than a fiction Looking at voluntary breathholding it turns out that were certainly not unique among nonaquatic mammals in being able to hold our breath Having said that its a dif cult thing to investigate in other mammals as unlike humans they tend not to comply when you ask them to breathhold And experimental evidence shows that heart rate doesnt drop during breathholding At least it doesnt if youre breathholding on land When youre submerged in cold water its a different story cooling the face does lead to a slower heart rate in most people But once again this isnt evidence of an aquatic ape ancestry as it turns out to be a very general characteristic of airbreathing vertebrates This reduction in heart rate is just one of the physiological responses that are sometimes described together as the mammalian diving re ex But physiological responses that could be useful in diving are also and perhaps even more importantly useful for not drowning While our ability to breathhold may not be all that special when we compare ourselves with other animals its now proving very useful in one particular area of medicine Radiotherapy for breast cancer involves directing radiation very precisely at the tumour This may require several minutes worth of radiation and so its usually done in short bursts between breaths But if the patient can keep her chest perfectly still for several minutes it means that the entire dose can be delivered in the right place in one go The problem of course is that most people just like me struggle to hold their breath for much longer than a minute But doctors at University Hospital Birmingham have recently performed careful experiments that show that if patients are ventilated with oxygenrich air before attempting a breath hold they can manage to hold their breath for an impressive veandahalf minutes Surprisingly the trick seems to lie not in fooling the bodys usual sensors for low oxygen or high carbon dioxide levels in the blood but in fooling the diaphragm When you breathe in youre contracting the muscle of your diaphragm pulling it at so that the volume of your chest increases and air is drawn into your lungs When you hold your breath you keep your diaphragm in this contracted state Arti cially raising oxygen levels and reducing carbon dioxide levels before a breathhold as in the Birmingham radiotherapy experiments may work by delaying fatigue in the diaphragm And not so useful if youre trying to keep your chest perfectly still breathing out a little air lets the diaphragm relax a little and helps you to prolong a breathhold exactly as I found when attempting my breathhold And so its your diaphragm the main muscle of breathing that is also in charge when it comes to reaching the breakpoint of your breathhold Eventually even if youve fooled it for a while the signals from the diaphragm are just too strong and you have to give in and take a breath,How long can you hold your breath Im trying it right now The rst 30 seconds are easy Im ready to give up at 45 seconds but I continue and it seems to get easier for a while But as the second

29,It was not so much how hard people found the challenge but how far they would go to avoid it that left researchers gobsmacked The task To sit in a chair and do nothing but think So unbearable did some nd it that they took up the safe but alarming opportunity to give themselves mild electric shocks in an attempt to break the tedium Twothirds of men pressed a button to deliver a painful jolt during a 15minute spell of solitude Under the same conditions a quarter of women pressed the shock button The difference scientists suspect is that men tend to be more sensationseeking than women The report from psychologists at Virginia and Harvard Universities is one of a surprising few to tackle the question of why most of us nd it so hard to do nothing In more than 11 separate studies the researchers showed that people hated being left to think regardless of their age education income or the amount of time they spent using smartphones or social media Timothy Wilson who led the work said the ndings were not necessarily a re ection of the pace of modern life or the spread of mobile devices and social media Instead those things might be popular because of our constant urge to do something rather than nothing The rst run of experiments began with students being ushered alone without phones books or anything to write with into an unadorned room and told to think The only rules were they had to stay seated and not fall asleep They were informed speci cally or vaguely that they would have six to 15 minutes alone The students were questioned when the time was up On average they did not enjoy the experience They struggled to concentrate Their minds wandered even with nothing to distract them Even giving them time to think about what to think about did not help In case the unfamiliar setting hampered the ability to think the researchers ran the experiment again with people at home They got much the same results only people found the experience even more miserable and cheated by getting up from their chair or checking their phones To see if the effect was found only in students the scientists recruited more than 100 people aged 18 to 77 from a church and a farmers market They too disliked being left to their thoughts But the most staggering result was yet to come To check whether people might actually prefer something bad to nothing at all the students were given the option of administering a mild electric shock They had been asked earlier to rate how unpleasant the shocks were alongside other options such as looking at pictures of cockroaches or hearing the sound of a knife rubbing against a bottle All the students picked for the test said they would pay to avoid mild electric shocks after receiving a demonstration To the researchers surprise 12 of 18 men gave themselves up to four electric shocks as did six of 24 women What is striking is that simply being alone with their thoughts was apparently so aversive that it drove many participants to selfadminister an electric shock that they had earlier said they would pay to avoid the scientists write in Science Jessica AndrewsHanna at the University of Colorado said many students would probably zap themselves to cheer up a tedious lecture But she says more needs to be known about the motivation of the shockers in Wilsons study Imagine the setup a person is told to sit in a chair with wires attached to their skin and a button that will deliver a harmless but uncomfortable shock and they are told to just sit there and entertain themselves with their thoughts she said

168,Nelson Mandela the towering figure of Africas struggle for freedom and a hero to millions around the world has died at the age of 95 South Africas first black president died in the company of his family at home in Johannesburg after years of declining health which had caused him to withdraw from public life The news was announced to the country by the current president Jacob Zuma who in a sombre televised address said Mandela had departed around 850pm local time and was at peace This is the moment of our deepest sorrow Zuma said Our nation has lost its greatest son What made Nelson Mandela great was precisely what made him human We saw in him what we seek in ourselves Fellow South Africans Nelson Mandela brought us together and it is together that we will bid him farewell Zuma announced that Mandela would receive a state funeral and ordered that flags fly at halfmast Archbishop Desmond Tutu led a memorial service in Cape Town where he called for South Africa to become as a nation what Mandela had been as a man Barack Obama led tributes from world leaders referring to Mandela by his clan name Madiba The US president said Through his fierce dignity and unbending will to sacrifice his own freedom for the freedom of others Madiba transformed South Africa and moved all of us His journey from a prisoner to a president embodied the promise that human beings and countries can change for the better His commitment to transfer power and reconcile with those who jailed him set an example that all humanity should aspire to whether in the lives of nations or our own personal lives UK prime minister David Cameron said A great light has gone out in the world and described Mandela as a hero of our time FW de Klerk the South African president who freed Mandela shared the Nobel Peace Prize with him in 1993 and paved the way for him to become South Africas first postapartheid head of state said the news was deeply saddening for South Africa and the world He lived reconciliation He was a great unifier de Klerk said People gathered in the streets of South Africa to celebrate Mandelas life In Soweto people gathered to sing and dance near the house where he once lived They formed a circle in the middle of Vilakazi Street and sang songs from the antiapartheid struggle Some people were draped in South African flags and the green yellow and black colours of Mandelas party the African National Congress ANC Mandelas death sends South Africa deep into mourning and selfreflection nearly 20 years after he led the country from racial apartheid to inclusive democracy But his passing will also be keenly felt by people around the world who revered Mandela as one of historys last great statesmen and a moral paragon comparable with Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and Martin Luther King It was his act of forgiveness after spending 27 years in prison 18 of them on Robben Island that will assure his place in history With South Africa facing possible civil war Mandela sought reconciliation with the white minority to build a new democracy He led the ANC to victory in the countrys first multiracial election in 1994 He then voluntarily stepped down after one term Born Rolihlahla Dalibhunga in a small village in the Eastern Cape on 18 July 1918 Mandela was given his English name Nelson by a teacher at his school He joined the ANC in 1943 and became a cofounder of its youth league In 1952 he started South Africas first black law firm with his partner Oliver Tambo Mandela was a charming charismatic figure with a passion for boxing and an eye for women He once said I cant help it if the ladies take note of me I am not going to protest When the ANC was banned in 1960 Mandela went underground After the Sharpeville massacre in which 69 black protesters were shot dead by police he took the difficult decision to launch an armed struggle He was arrested and eventually charged with sabotage and attempting to overthrow the government Conducting his own defence in the Rivonia trial in 1964 he said I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve But if needs be it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die He escaped the death penalty but was sentenced to life in prison a huge blow to the ANC which had to regroup to continue the struggle But unrest grew in townships and international pressure on the apartheid regime slowly tightened Finally in 1990 FW de Klerk lifted the ban on the ANC and Mandela was released from prison amid scenes of jubilation witnessed around the world His presidency rode a wave of tremendous global goodwill but was not without its difficulties After leaving frontline politics in 1999 he admitted he should have moved sooner against the spread of HIV and Aids in South Africa Archbishop Desmond Tutu who headed the truth and reconciliation committee after the fall of apartheid said He transcended race and class in his personal actions through his warmth and through his willingness to listen and to empathize with others And he restored others faith in Africa and Africans Mandela continued to make occasional appearances at ANC events and attended the inauguration of the current president Jacob Zuma His 91st birthday was marked by the first annual Mandela Day in his honour Married three times he had six children 17 grandchildren and 14 greatgrandchildren,Nelson Mandela the towering figure of Africas struggle for freedom and a hero to millions

the streets of South Africa to celebrate Mandelas life In Soweto people gathered to sing and dance near the house where he once lived They sang songs from the antiapartheid struggle Some people were wrapped in South African flags and the green yellow and black colours of Mandelas party the African National Congress ANC Mandelas death sends South Africa deep into mourning and selfreflection nearly 20 years after he led the country from racial apartheid to democracy for all But his passing will also be felt by people around the world who considered Mandela to be one of historys last great statesmen comparable with Gandhi and Martin Luther King It was his act of forgiveness after spending 27 years in prison 18 of them on Robben Island that will assure his place in history With South Africa facing possible civil war Mandela chose reconciliation with the white minority to build a new democracy He led the ANC to victory in the countrys first multiracial election in 1994 He then voluntarily stepped down after one term Born Rolihlahla Dalibhunga in a small village in the Eastern Cape on 18 July 1918 Mandela was given his English name Nelson by a teacher at his school He joined the ANC in 1943 and became a cofounder of its youth league In 1952 he started South Africas first black law firm with his partner Oliver Tambo Mandela was a charming charismatic figure with a passion for boxing and an eye for women He once said I cant help it if the ladies notice me I am not going to protest When the ANC was banned in 1960 Mandela went underground After the Sharpeville massacre in which 69 black protesters were shot dead by police he took the difficult decision to begin an armed struggle He was arrested and eventually charged with sabotage and attempting to overthrow the government Conducting his own defence in the Rivonia trial in 1964 he said I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve But if necessary it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die He was not given the death penalty but was sentenced to life in prison Finally in 1990 FW de Klerk lifted the ban on the ANC and Mandela was released from prison to scenes of great happiness that were seen around the world Archbishop Desmond Tutu said He restored others faith in Africa and Africans Mandelas 91st birthday was marked by the first annual Mandela Day in his honour Married three times he had six children 17 grandchildren and 14 greatgrandchildren,train,ADV,INT
151,The Canadian tennis player Frank Dancevic slammed Australian Open organizers for forcing players to compete in inhumane conditions after he collapsed on court as temperatures rose to 41C Dancevic who collapsed during the second set of his firstround match against Frances Benot Paire on the uncovered court six at Melbourne Park and passed out for a minute said conditions were plainly dangerous for the players He also said the heat had caused him to hallucinate I was dizzy from the middle of the first set and then I saw Snoopy and I thought Wow Snoopy thats weird I think its inhumane I dont think its fair to anybody to the players to the fans to the sport when you see players pulling out of matches passing out he added Ive played fiveset matches all my life and being out there for a set and a half and passing out with heat stroke its not normal Having players with so many problems and complaining to the tournament that its too hot to play until somebody dies they just keep going on with it and putting matches on in this heat I personally dont think its fair and I know a lot of players dont think its fair Other players were in broad agreement The British number one Andy Murray said Its definitely something that you have to look at a little bit As much as its easy to say the conditions are safe it only takes one bad thing to happen And it looks terrible for the whole sport when people are collapsing ball kids are collapsing people in the stands are collapsing Thats not great I know when I went out to hit before the match the conditions at 2303pm were very very tough Whether its safe or not I dont know Theres been some issues in other sports with players having heart attacks Caroline Wozniacki said I put the water bottle down on the court and it started melting a little bit underneath the plastic So you know it was warm John Isner who retired from his firstround match with a right ankle injury said It was like an oven when I open the oven and the potatoes are done Thats what its like The defending champion Victoria Azarenka took the same line It felt pretty hot like youre dancing in a frying pan or something like that she said The tournaments extreme heat contingency plan was put into force for womens matches on Tuesday allowing an extra tenminute break between the second and third sets Under a change to the rules for 2014 however the decision on whether to stop matches at the tournament is now at the discretion of the tournament director Wayne McKewen Rather than use the raw Celsius readings to assess the heat organizers prefer to use the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature composite which also gauges humidity and wind to identify the perceived conditions Organizers said temperatures peaked at 422C in the early evening on Tuesday and conditions had never reached the point where play would be stopped We have to reach a minimum threshold and have a forecast that it will be sustained for a reasonable time McKewen said in a statement That didnt happen While conditions were hot and uncomfortable the relatively low level of humidity ensured play would continue Dancevic who said he had felt dizzy from the middle of the second set resumed after medical attention but unsurprisingly ended up losing 76 63 64 I was really close to stopping completely he said I wasnt really running too much towards the end I wasnt tired I just felt my body temperature was too high A ball boy had earlier required medical attention after collapsing during Milos Raonics 76 61 46 62 victory over Daniel GimenoTraver on the equally exposed court eight and the tournament shortened rotations for the ball boys to 45minute shifts Chinas Peng Shuai also said the heat had caused her to cramp up and vomit and she had to be helped from the court after her 75 46 63 defeat to Japans Kurumi Nara Officials played down health risks saying the majority of matches were completed without calls for medical attention Of course there were a few players who experienced heatrelated illness or discomfort but none required significant medical intervention after they had completed their match Tim Wood the tournaments chief medical officer said in a statement Most competitors though followed Roger Federers line that although conditions were tough they were the same for both players Its just a mental thing the Swiss said albeit before Dancevic collapsed If youve trained hard enough your entire life or the last few weeks and you believe you can do it and come through it theres no reason If you cant deal with it you throw in the towel Dancevic disagreed I dont think its much to do with the shape the players are in Some players are used to the heat their bodies can genetically handle the heat and others cant he said Its hazardous to be out there its

130,Coal is likely to rival oil as the worlds biggest source of energy in the next five years with potentially disastrous consequences for the climate according to the worlds leading authority on energy economics One of the biggest factors behind the rise in coal use has been the massive increase in the use of shale gas in the US New research from the International Energy Agency IEA shows that coal consumption is increasing all over the world even in countries and regions with carboncutting targets except in the US where shale gas has displaced coal The decline of coal consumption in the US has helped to cut prices for coal globally This has made it more attractive even in Europe where coal use was supposed to be discouraged by the Emissions Trading Scheme Maria van der Hoeven Executive Director of the IEA said Coals share of the global energy mix continues to grow each year and if no changes are made to current policies coal will catch oil within a decade Coal is abundant and found in most regions of the world unlike conventional oil and gas and can be cheaply extracted As a result coal was used to meet nearly half of the rise in demand for energy globally in the past decade According to the IEA demand from China and India will drive world coal use in the coming five years with India likely to overtake the US as the worlds second biggest consumer China is the biggest coal importer and Indonesia the biggest exporter having temporarily overtaken Australia According to the IEAs MediumTerm Coal Market Report the world will burn 12bn more tonnes of coal per year by 2017 compared with today the equivalent of the current coal consumption of Russia and the US combined Global coal consumption is forecast to reach 43bn tonnes of oil equivalent by 2017 while oil consumption is forecast to reach 44bn tonnes by the same date With the highest carbon emissions of any major fossil fuel coal is a huge contributor to climate change particularly when burned in oldfashioned inefficient power stations When these are not equipped with special scrubbing equipment to remove chemicals coal can also produce sulphur emissions the leading cause of acid rain and other pollutants such as mercury and soot particles Van der Hoeven said that without a high carbon price to discourage the growth in coal use and encourage cleaner technologies such as renewable power generation only competition from lowerpriced gas could realistically cut demand for coal This has happened in the US owing to the extraordinary increase in the production of shale gas in that market in the past five years She said The US experience suggests that a more efficient gas market marked by flexible pricing and fuelled by indigenous unconventional resources that are produced sustainably can reduce coal use carbon dioxide emissions and consumers electricity bills Europe China and other regions should take note That would mean producing much more shale gas as conventional gas resources are running down in their easily accessible locations In Europe the Emissions Trading Scheme was supposed to discourage highcarbon power generation by imposing a price on carbon dioxide emissions This was done through issuing generators and energyintensive companies with a set quota of emissions permits requiring them to buy extra permits if they needed to emit more than their allowance But an overallocation coupled with the effects of the financial crisis and recession has led to a large surplus of permits on the market which has in turn led to a plunge in permit prices At current levels a few euros per tonne of carbon there is little incentive to seek out lower carbon fuels and coal is enjoying a renaissance in Europe That means one of the worlds only regulatory market mechanisms aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions is failing in its key goals The world faces the likelihood of an increased risk of climate change as a result of this runaway consumption of the highest carbon fossil fuel,Coal will probably rival oil as the worlds biggest source of energy in the next five years with possible disastrous consequences for the climate says the worlds leading authority on energy economics One of the biggest factors behind the rise in coal use has been the massive increase in the use of shale gas in the US New research from the International Energy Agency IEA shows that coal

172,The government is bracing itself for thousands of legal claims from people who were imprisoned and allegedly mistreated during the final days of the British Empire after the High Court in London ruled that three elderly Kenyans detained and tortured during the Mau Mau rebellion have the right to sue for damages The court on Friday rejected claims from the governments lawyers that too much time had elapsed since the sevenyear insurgency in the 1950s and it was no longer possible to hold a fair trial In 2011 the same High Court judge Mr Justice McCombe rejected the governments claim that the three claimants should be suing the Kenyan government as it had inherited Britains legal responsibilities on independence in 1963 Human rights activists in Kenya estimate more than 5000 of the 70000plus people detained by the British colonial authorities are still alive Many may bring claims against the British government The ruling may also make it possible for victims of colonial atrocities in other parts of the world to sue But many more men and women around the world who were imprisoned and allegedly mistreated during the conflicts that often accompanied the British retreat from empire may also be considering claims cases that could bring to light evidence of brutal mistreatment of colonial subjects and result in a new and uncomfortable understanding of recent British history The Foreign Office acknowledged that the ruling had potentially significant and farreaching legal implications and said it was planning to appeal The normal time limit for bringing a civil action is three to six years a spokesman said In this case that period has been extended to over 50 years despite the fact that the key decision makers are dead and unable to give their account of what happened Fridays historic victory for Paulo Muoka Nzili 85 Wambugu Wa Nyingi 84 and Jane Muthoni Mara 73 was the result of a threeyear battle through the courts They had suffered what their lawyers describe as unspeakable acts of brutality including castration beatings and severe sexual assaults A fourth claimant dropped out while a fifth Susan Ciongombe Ngondi died two years ago aged 71 In the Kenyan capital Nairobi the news from London was relayed to two of the complainants Nyingi and Mara by mobile phone They had been sitting silently with their supporters in a sunscorched garden and reacted with joy when the word came hugging dancing and eventually raising their hands to the sky to pray Nyingi who was detained for about nine years beaten unconscious and bears the marks from leg manacles whipping and caning said For me I just wanted the truth to be out Even the children of my children should know what happened What should happen is that people should be compensated so they can begin to forgive the British government Mara said Im very happy and my heart is clean Asked what she would tell her four children she said simply I will tell them I won McCombe said in 2011 that there was ample evidence that there may have been systematic torture of detainees On Friday he ruled that a fair trial was possible and highlighted the fact that thousands of documents came to light in 2011 after the Foreign Office admitted to a secret archive of colonialera files During the course of their attempts to have the claims struck out efforts that the claimants lawyer Martyn Day described as morally repugnant the British governments lawyers accepted that all three of the elderly Kenyans were tortured by the colonial authorities Day said The British government has admitted that these three Kenyans were brutally tortured by the British colony and yet they have been hiding behind technical legal defences for three years in order to avoid any legal responsibility There will undoubtedly be victims of colonial torture from Malaya to the Yemen from Cyprus to Palestine who will be reading this judgment with great care Among those who are known to have been watching the case closely are a number of veterans of the Eoka insurgency in Cyprus in the 1950s One has already met the Mau Mau claimants lawyers Any Cypriot claimants would be able to rely not only on British documentation but upon the archives of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva Those files are kept secret for 40 years and then opened to public scrutiny The Red Cross documented hundreds of torture cases in Cyprus where reporters covering the conflict referred to British interrogators as HMTs Her Majestys Torturers There may also be claims from Malaysia where large numbers of people were detained during the 12year war with communist insurgents and their supporters that began in 1948 Relatives of 24 unarmed rubber plantation workers massacred by British troops are currently fighting through the British courts for a public inquiry Many former prisoners of the British in Aden may also have claims against the British government although as Aden is now part of Yemen British lawyers may have difficulty making contact with potential clients there,The High Court in London has ruled that three elderly Kenyans detained and tortured during the Mau Mau rebellion have the right

187,Prince Harry has flown out of Afghanistan at the end of a fourmonth tour during which he admitted killing insurgents while piloting his Apache helicopter and spoke in rare depth about the tensions and frustrations of being a royal who craved life out of the spotlight He also revealed his disdain for and distrust of some sections of the media and described how his father constantly reminded him to behave more like a member of the royal family A commander of the armys most sophisticated attack helicopter the prince said he had fired on the Taliban during operations to support ground troops and rescue injured Afghan and NATO personnel His remarks may be seized upon by insurgents to stir antiBritish sentiment but the prince said he was only doing his job Most of the time the helicopter acted more as a deterrent he said In a series of interviews during his time based at Camp Bastion in Helmand Province he hinted at the difficulty of reconciling the different roles in his life The prince known as Captain Wales in the army explained his three mes One in the army one socially in my own private time and then one with the family and stuff like that So there is a switch and I flick it when necessary He admitted he sometimes let himself down with his laddish behaviour which he put down to probably being too much army and not enough prince but he said he was entitled to privacy too In another unusually frank exchange he aimed biting criticism at the media especially the Sun the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph three of the royal familys most ardent supporters in Fleet Street He said he was particularly annoyed by articles comparing his role as an Apache copilot gunner to Spitfire crews waiting to scramble during the second world war No its not like that at all he said The prince said his suspicion of the media was rooted in the treatment of his family when I was very small but that he couldnt help monitoring the stories written about him Of course I read them the prince said If theres a story and somethings been written about me I want to know whats being said But all it does is just upset me and anger me that people can get away with writing the stuff they do not just about me but about everything and everybody My father always says Dont read it Everyone says Dont read it because its always rubbish The prince was posted to Afghanistan last September to command a 45m Apache helicopter one of the militarys most sophisticated and wellarmed aircraft During his tour the Apaches flew missions supporting NATO troops fighting the Taliban and accompanied British Chinook and US Black Hawk medical helicopters during casualty evacuations Four years ago the prince had to be spirited out of Afghanistan during his first tour after a media embargo was broken by mistake by an Australian magazine This time the Ministry of Defence chose to publicize his deployment on the understanding that newspapers and broadcasters would not give a running commentary on his life out there to allow him to get on with his job Twoman crews from the BBC Sky and ITN were sent once each to report on his visit while a photographer and a reporter from the Press Association were embedded on all three visits Asked whether he felt more comfortable being Captain Wales than Prince Harry his reply was one of the most revealing he has given about his relationship with Prince Charles Definitely Ive always been like that My fathers always trying to remind me about who I am and stuff like that But its very easy to forget about who I am when I am in the army Everyones wearing the same uniform and doing the same kind of thing I get on well with the lads and I enjoy my job It really is as simple as that Shortly before he went to Afghanistan the prince was caught in another media furore when pictures emerged of him frolicking naked in Las Vegas during a private party Harry said he had let himself down but also blamed the media I probably let myself down I let my family down I let other people down But at the end of the day I was in a private area and there should be a certain amount of privacy that one should expect It was probably a classic example of me probably being too much army and not enough prince Its a simple case of that The papers knew that I was going out to Afghanistan anyway so the way I was treated from them I dont think is acceptable He added Certain people remind me Remember who you are so dont always drop your guard Asked where he and his brothers fascination with helicopters came from he said Probably the

41,To a master traditional navigator like Tua Pittman from Raratonga in the Cook Islands a canoe is much more than just a means of transport The canoe is our island the crew members are the community and the navigator is the leader Pittman says He continues explaining that the converse is also true An island is our canoe the community are the crew members and the politicians and leaders are the navigators On a canoe you are not just going from one destination to another using the stars the moon the sun and the birds Navigation is using the philosophies of being a leader to show your crew members the light of life It has been a whirlwind week for the crews of the otilla of four sailing canoes since arriving in Sydney for the start of the World Parks Congress Tuas journey began at the Cook Islands on 25 September The rst leg took the islanders to Samoa then Fiji Vanuatu and onto the Gold Coast before heading south to Sydney Around 100 crew members were involved in the various stages of the voyage and they aimed to travel using only traditional navigation techniques Unfortunately said Tua the crews were forced to rely on modern navigation equipment on some occasions to reach Australia in time for the Congress The of cial title of the expedition is the Mua Voyage and it is a partnership between the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN Oceania Regional Of ce and ve Paci c Island countries Samoa Tonga New Zealand the Cook Islands and Fiji The main goal of the 6000nauticalmile 11000km trip was to deliver a special message to the World Parks Congress In part the message said We see the signs of overexploitation We no longer see the sh and other marine creatures in the size diversity or abundance of the past We witness the change as foreign shing eets ply our waters in a race to strip our resources Our coral reefs the greatest in the world and our mangrove and wetland spawning grounds are disappearing Our ocean is vast but not limitless Growing global populations and the relentless pursuit of unsustainable development are reducing the ability of our ocean to sustain life In spite of the effort and urgency behind the Paci c Islanders message to the delegates of the Congress much of the nal days of the marine part of the Congress were taken up with trying to set a revised target for the amount of the ocean that needs to be protected in marine sanctuaries According to the IUCN as of 2013 the amount of the worlds oceans in marine protected areas was not even three per cent and less than one per cent of that is no take This was despite a target of 2030 notake areas set by the last World Parks Congress held in South Africa in 2003 Worldleading marine scientist Professor Callum Roberts from the University of York was one of the scientists who helped set the 2030 target in 2003 But he said it was not enough The IUCN should now lift its target from 30 to 33 New research strengthens the case for the 30 target set previously to now be raised Any reduction in efforts at this stage and moment in history would be disastrous for our oceans After dif cult negotiations the World Parks Congress delegates passed a motion that will dramatically shift the goals for global marine management Instead of the 2030 aspirational target the IUCNs new of cial position is to urgently increase the ocean area that is effectively and equitably managed in ecologically representative and wellconnected systems of MPAs marine protected areas or other effective conservation measures by 2030 these should include strictly protected areas that amount to at least 30 of each marine habitat and address both biodiversity and ecosystem services Tua Pittman was delighted with the news that a strong resolution on the planets oceans had passed the Congress Its just like a huge reward for all the effort that we made to be here and to be heard To hear they made that resolution is fantastic Its a step in the right direction He says that while much of the traditional navigational aids were things such as the sun moon and stars that never changed and would at least on a human scale always be there other impacts of environmental degradation were becoming clearer when voyaging across the Paci c He said he was 55 and in his lifetime he was already beginning to see that it was much harder to catch sh on the open ocean He also said that pollution was worsening particularly as the canoes approached big cities such as Sydney And the effects of climate change were already beginning to impact seriously on Paci c Islanders The decisions of the big countries have twice thrice four times the impact on the small countries than on developed large nations Many times people dont even know where our islands are and from the eyes of a traditional navigator our people have a very very deep concern because we are talking about decisions made far away that impact on our homes The Mua Voyage had been a massive logistical undertaking said Tua Years of preparation and navigational planning went into such a trip and it was critical to the voyagers that the world listened to their message and acted The leaders of wealthy countries he went on need to start to think more like traditional navigators who recognize their vessels are mere specks in an enormous sea Most importantly and spoken like a true navigator Tua says politicians must seek a different route to avoid the pending ecological crises that are beginning to befall the small island nations The world needs to nd a different path,To a traditional navigator like Tua Pittman from Raratonga in the Cook Islands a canoe is much more than just a means of transport The canoe is our island the crew members are the community and the navigator is the leader Pittman says He continues On a canoe you are not just going from one destination to another using the stars the moon the sun and the birds Navigation is using the philosophies of being a leader to show your crew members the light of life It has been a busy week for the crews of four sailing canoes since arriving in Sydney for the start of the World Parks Congress Tuas journey began at the Cook Islands on 25 September The islanders sailed to Samoa then Fiji Vanuatu and onto the Gold Coast before sailing south to Sydney Around 100 crew members were involved in the voyage and they aimed to travel using only traditional navigation techniques Unfortunately said Tua the crews had to rely on modern navigation equipment at times to reach Australia in time for the Congress The of cial title of the expedition is the Mua Voyage It is a partnership between the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN Oceania Regional Of ce and ve Paci c Island countries Samoa Tonga New Zealand the Cook Islands and Fiji The main goal of the 6000nauticalmile 11000km trip was to deliver a special message to the World Parks Congress The message said We see the signs of overexploitation We no longer see the sh and other marine creatures in the size diversity or abundance of the past We witness the change as foreign shing eets take our resources Our coral reefs the greatest in the world and our spawning grounds are disappearing Our ocean is vast but not limitless Growing global populations and unsustainable development are reducing the ability of our ocean to sustain life The Paci c Islanders have put a lot of effort into their urgent message to the delegates of the Congress But despite this the Congress has spent much of its time trying to set a revised target for the amount of the ocean that needs to be protected in marine sanctuaries According to the IUCN in 2013 the amount of the worlds oceans in marine protected areas was not even three per cent and less than one per cent of that is no take no shing This was despite a target of 2030 notake areas set by the last World Parks Congress in 2003 Marine scientist Professor Callum Roberts was one of the scientists who helped set the 2030 target in 2003 But he said it was not enough The IUCN should now lift its target from 30 to 33 New research shows that we need to raise the 30 target Any reduction in efforts at this stage and moment in history would be disastrous for our oceans After dif cult negotiations the World Parks Congress delegates passed a motion that will dramatically change the goals for global marine management Instead of the 2030 target the IUCN now says that each marine habitat should include strictly protected areas of at least 30 These areas should address both biodiversity and ecosystem services Tua Pittman was delighted with the news that a strong resolution on the planets oceans had passed the Congress Its a huge reward for all the effort that we made to be here and to be heard To hear they made that resolution is fantastic Its a step in the right direction He said he was 55 and in his lifetime he was already beginning to see that it was much harder to catch sh on the open ocean He also said that pollution was getting worse particularly as the canoes approached big cities such as Sydney And climate change is already beginning to have a serious effect on Paci c Islanders The decisions of the big countries impact on the small countries twice three times four times more than they impact on developed large nations The Mua Voyage had been a massive logistical undertaking said Tua Years of preparation and navigational planning went into such a trip and it was critical to the voyagers that the world listened to their message and acted He said that the

81,They call him the Robin Hood of the banks a man who took out dozens of loans worth almost half a million euros with no intention of ever paying them back Instead Enric Duran handed the money out to projects that created and promoted alternatives to capitalism After 14 months in hiding Duran is unapologetic even though his activities could land him in jail Im proud of what I did he said in an interview by Skype from an undisclosed location The money he said had created opportunities It generated a movement that allowed us to push forward with the construction of alternatives And it allowed us to build a powerful network that groups together these initiatives From 2006 to 2008 Duran took out 68 commercial and personal loans from 39 banks in Spain He farmed the money out to social activists funding speaking tours against capitalism and TV cameras for a media network I saw that on one side these social movements were building alternatives but that they lacked resources and communication capacities he said Meanwhile our reliance on perpetual growth was creating a system that created money out of nothing The loans he swindled from banks were his way of regulating and denouncing this situation he said He started slowly I lled out a few credit applications with my real details They denied me but I just wanted to get a feel for what they were asking for From there the former tabletennis coach began to weave an intricate web of accounts payments and transfers I was learning constantly By the summer of 2007 he had discovered how to make the system work applying for loans under the name of a false television production company Then I managed to get a lot 492000 to be exact Duran was arrested in Spain in 2009 on charges brought against him by six of the 39 banks that had lent him money He spent two months in prison before being bailed for 50000 In February 2013 facing up to eight years in prison he decided to ee rather than stand trial I dont see legitimacy in a judicial system based on authority because I dont recognize its authority he said His actions he said were in the vanguard of a worldwide debate on the economic crisis The timing pushed the anticapitalist movement into the light just as many Spaniards were seeking alternatives to a system that had wreaked havoc on their lives While the same actions would probably be better understood in todays Spain he said that they would not be needed The anticapitalist movement has grown from a fringe movement to one supported by thousands of Spaniards he said evidenced by the widely supported movements such as the Indignados Success has helped the movement become self suf cient We now have the capacity to generate resources said Duran adding somewhat ironically that this was exactly what banks issue credit for to advance and generate a situation that allows you to be independent Duran is widening his focus to include Spains justice system by promoting restorative justice The people in Spain who believe that banks dont work they think that I dont owe anything Ive already done my work he said But there is a part of a population that is not in agreement with us and I think I should respond to that In his case he said the element of reciprocity he could offer to banks might lie in the insight he gleaned from years of obtaining bank loans fraudulently He could share his thoughts on which best practices work and the bad ones that dont he suggested for the general population and for bank workers,They call him the Robin Hood of the banks a man who took out many

2,Such is the lot of the modernday chemist you wait ages for a new element to turn up and then four come along at once Discovered by researchers in Japan Russia and the US the four new elements are the first to be added to the periodic table since 2011 when elements 114 and 116 were included The new elements all spectacularly shortlived and highly radioactive complete the periodic tables seventh row and render science textbooks around the world out of date The USbased International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry IUPAC the global organization that governs chemical nomenclature terminology and measurement verified the elements on 30 December 2015 after poring over studies dating back to 2004 The scientists who found them must now come up with formal names to replace the clunky Latinbased placeholders ununtrium ununpentium ununseptium and ununoctium which reflect their atomic numbers 113 115 117 and 118 The atomic number is the number of protons found in an elements atomic nucleus IUPAC announced that a RussianAmerican team of scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California had produced sufficient evidence to claim the discovery of elements 115 117 and 118 The body awarded credit for the discovery of element 113 which had also been claimed by the Russians and Americans to a team of scientists from the RIKEN Institute in Japan The decision means Japan becomes the first Asian country to name an element Under IUPAC rules new elements can be named after mythological concepts minerals a place or country or a scientist When elements 114 and 116 were assigned formal names in 2012 scientists chose flerovium and livermorium respectively after the Flerov Lab at Dubnas Joint Institute of Research and the Lawrence Livermore Lab in the US where the elements were discovered Kosuke Morita who led the research at RIKEN said his team now planned to look to the uncharted territory of element 119 and beyond Jan Reedijk president of the Inorganic Chemistry Division of IUPAC said The chemistry community is eager to see its most cherished table finally being completed down to the seventh row The Japanese team is believed to be considering three names for ununtrium japonium rikenium and nishinarium after the Nishina Center for AcceleratorBased Science where the element was found They will have been thinking about it for a while already said Polly Arnold professor of chemistry at Edinburgh University This is painstaking work All this trying to understand Mother Nature helps us with our models and with understanding radioactive decay If we understand it better hopefully we can do better at dealing with nuclear waste and things that are important in the real world It also leads to fantastic technological advances in building the kit to make these observations Along with new names the scientists must propose twoletter symbols for the elements When IUPAC has received the researchers suggestions they will be put up for public review for five months That allows scientists and others to raise any objections In 1996 the symbol Cp was proposed for copernicium or element 112 but it was swapped to Cn when scientists complained that Cp referred to another substance To discover the elements researchers at the three labs slammed lighter nuclei into one another and looked for signature radioactive decays that should come from the new elements Ununtrium and ununpentium are thought to be metals while ununseptium could be a metalloid a material bearing some metallic properties The fourth element ununoctium may be a noble gas like other group18 elements helium neon and argon It is hard to know for sure because so few atoms of each element have ever been made Paul Karol chair of the IUPAC panel that verified the elements said For now most of the successes will be used by nuclear theorists to improve their understanding of the structure and stability of these very heavy nuclei as experimenters seek the alleged but highly probable island of stability at or near element 120 or perhaps 126 It might be that those elements have long enough lifetimes for their detailed chemistry to be explored Practical applications of the new elements if any are a long way off because of the difficulty in synthesis,Chemists have waited a long time for a new element to turn

143,The sight of colleagues and acquaintances taking a drag on an ecigarette has become commonplace But have we reached peak vape Statistics suggest that vaping among smokers and recent exsmokers who comprise the vast majority of vapers may already be on the decline The gures will be studied closely by the major ecigarette rms which have poured millions into promoting a technology that was thought to have been growing in popularity Figures released in 2014 by the health charity Action on Smoking and Health ASH reveal that usage among adults in Britain of electronic cigarettes which do not contain tobacco and produce vapour not smoke tripled from an estimated 700000 users in 2012 to 21 million in 2014 However gures collated by the Smoking Toolkit Study a research body backed by the Department of Health that provides quarterly updates on smoking trends show vapings appeal may be waning Vaping rates among smokers and exsmokers rose steadily until the end of 2013 when some 22 of smokers and exsmokers were vaping But this proportion levelled out throughout 2014 before dropping to 19 during the nal quarter of 2014 Early signs suggest the decline has continued into 2015 The drop is described as statistically signi cant by Professor Robert West of UCLs Department of Epidemiology and Public Health who collates the gures for the Toolkit Smokers are the key group for ecigarette rms because seven out of ten vapers are smokers Only around 1 of people who have never smoked have tried an electronic cigarette Numbers who use ecigarettes while continuing to smoke are going down West said Weve only been tracking vaping for just over a year so its a short time period but we are not seeing growth in the number of longterm exsmokers or never smokers using ecigarettes That is not to say vaping rates might not change but at this stage it looks like theyre staying the same The levelling off in popularity of vaping in the UK would appear to be at odds with what is happening in the US where the technology has been promoted aggressively and where recent reports suggested it was growing in popularity However West questioned the interpretation of US data which made little distinction between people who had once tried an ecigarette and those who regularly vaped Fears that vaping could become fashionable among young nonsmokers appear to be misplaced according to experts Only 18 of children are regular users the ASH study found Instead ecigarettes seem to be most popular among adults seeking to quit While the gures published this month by Smoking In England show that the use of electronic cigarettes by smokers has levelled off their data also shows the huge increase in use since May 2011 said James Dunworth director and cofounder of ecigarettedirectcouk Our customers are still very happy with the product and technology and innovation in hardware is improving user experience and helping them to switch from traditional cigarettes Ecigarettes are behaving like a soupedup nicotine patch West agreed They are more popular than nicotine patches and may or may not be more effective Onethird of quit attempts use ecigarettes which makes them by far the most popular method of stopping Hazel Cheeseman director of policy at ASH said it was too soon to say whether vaping had peaked Although there are indications that the market hasnt grown in the UK for about a year there doesnt seem to be a decline in the number of people using electronic cigarettes to help them quit smoking Using an electronic cigarette is safer than smoking some but not all people nd them useful to help quit smoking and there is little evidence that they are leading to an increase in young people smoking It emerged recently that the European Commission EC is looking at increasing taxes on ecigarettes something that could have an impact on their popularity A new EC tobacco directive comes into force in 2016 that will limit the amount of nicotine in ecigarettes to below their current levels This may mean vapers will have to increase their usage to obtain the same hit again something that may make ecigarettes more expensive West suggested that policymakers should see ecigarettes as a smoking cessation aid and not subject them to the same regulations as smoking There is a tendency among some local authorities and organizations to treat ecigarettes as cigarettes and ban them in public places and outdoors he said The problem is that brings public health into disrepute It just sounds like youre having a go at vapers and hitting everyone with a sledgehammer and that undermines the public health messages were trying to get out We have to be careful not to stigmatize ecigarettes,We often see our colleagues and friends smoking an ecigarette But

53,Two mothers in South Africa have discovered they are raising each others daughters after they were mistakenly switched at birth in a hospital in 2010 But while one of the women wants to correct the error and reclaim her biological child the other is refusing to give back the girl she has raised as her own posing a huge legal dilemma Henk Strydom a lawyer for one of the mothers who cannot be identified because of a court order described the inadvertent swap as a travesty and tragedy that is unlikely to have a happy ending Both mothers gave birth at the Tambo Memorial Hospital in Boksburg east of Johannesburg on the same day in 2010 Nobody suspected anything Strydom said But in 2013 one of the mothers who is 33 and unemployed sued her expartner for maintenance for her daughter Strydom continued The man denied he was the father A DNA test was done and it was found it was not his baby and not her baby She was devastated She didnt know what to do Eventually she met the other mother and since December 2013 they have been attending joint counselling sessions arranged by the hospital This has included meeting their biological daughters Strydom said of his client She said there are resemblances to herself She conveyed to me that it was traumatic You can see its not easy for her She has to care for a child that is not hers on her own while her child is with someone else The woman reportedly became unhappy with the process and approached the childrens court in a bid to gain custody of her biological child but the other mother refused Strydom agreed to represent the woman who has one elder child pro bono Its a tragedy She wants the baby back but it seems the other mother is reluctant Its four years later you can understand she doesnt want to give up her baby The High Court in Pretoria has appointed the University of Pretorias Centre for Child Law to investigate what will now be in the best interests of the children which is the guiding principle under South African law It must report back within 90 days Strydom added Your guess is as good as mine what the court may decide Its a travesty How do you rectify it after four years The longer you wait the more traumatic it will be But whatever happens someone wont be happy He said at this point he and his client do not want to sue the hospital or government health department which is currently helping with the case and providing counselling The Centre for Child Law will now interview the mothers and fathers as well as any other person with a significant relationship with either of the girls The children and mothers will undergo full and thorough clinical assessments and may be seen by a psychologist Karabo Ngidi a lawyer with the centre said Whats going to happen must be in the best interests of the children Biology is an important aspect but not the only one The families are of Zulu ethnicity and so Zulu tradition culture and customary law will be a factor she added It is also still possible the ex

162,Robert Mysajek stops dead Between two paw prints on a muddy mountain track the scientist nds what he is looking for Droppings he enthuses Wolf sightings are so rare that the sighting of their faeces marks a good day even for a seasoned tracker But it is getting easier There are now an estimated 1500 wolves in Poland The number has doubled in 15 years Wolves are along with the brown bear the lynx and the wolverine Europes last large predator carnivores Conservationists from Britain Germany and the Netherlands are beating a path here to nd out how the country has saved this protected species slandered even in fairy tales Bits of bone and hair protrude from the precious black faeces It ate a red deer says the University of Warsaw biologist In my lab I can tell you all about this wolf not only its diet but its gender sexual habits age state of health and family connections DNA tests have established that Polish wolves are travellers One wolf reached the Netherlands where unfortunately it was hit by a car They have a tremendous range They need space The average territory required by a Polish pack is 250 sq km said Mysajek Is there any prospect of our ever being able to reintroduce wolves to Scotland asks student Alex Entwisle 23 on a eld trip to southern Poland from his college in the UK The animal science students have spent the day observing droppings and paw prints in the spruceclad Beskidy mountains of the Polish Carpathians Their hot discussion topic is whether to reintroduce wolves to the British Isles for the rst time since the 18th century As the guest of a British charity the Wolves and Humans Foundation Mysajek toured the Scottish Highlands in 2015 and took questions from villagers about the Polish experience The big difference between Scotland and Poland is that we eat pork We do not have many sheep here The similarity is that we have a lot of animals 300000 red deer and more than 800000 roe deer In Poland we also have a massive overpopulation of wild boar about 200000 and these are ravaging farmers cereal crops Here wolves are part of the solution he says The scientist who is a familiar face on Polish television says wolves are exceptional animals that are capable of moving up to 30km during a single hunt The Beskidy pack is a strong unit eight or nine individuals This year we have recorded ve cubs two yearlings and two adults We track them using motionactivated cameras in the forest and by following their prints in the mud and snow In each family group only one pair reproduces once a year All pack members care for the young with solidarity and devotion Mysajek the son of a shepherd is puzzled by wolves bad reputation Why does one speak of a lonewolf gunman Why did we have to have Little Red Riding Hood He is fascinated by these aloof canines who remained in the wild 33000 years ago when others decided on a much more comfortable existence as domestic dogs Wolves are not pooches Mysajek says only scienti c arguments the need to regenerate forests and control the wild animal population can save Europes wild carnivores especially the unpopular wolf Natural predators balance the ecosystem They keep herbivores in check thus allowing trees to grow tall for birds to nest in Shoot the deer It is only a partial solution he says In a diverse environment you have the socalled landscape of fear where herbivores no longer spend all day grazing on the tender riverside grass They move away as a precaution to avoid being trapped by a predator This gives the vegetation a chance The ban on wolf hunting in the western Carpathians came into force in 1995 and nationwide in Poland in 1998 There are now resident packs in virtually all the countrys major forests The predators coexist with humans rather than being fenced off as they are in African safari parks The Polish government pays compensation for livestock killed by wolves Mysajek advises farmers on erecting electric fences He has helped revive the use of two deterrents that for reasons no one quite understands wolves nd particularly scary red bunting hung around sheep pens and the bark of the uffy white Tatra Mountain Sheepdog The survival and mobility of Polands wolves has been helped by the countrys belated infrastructure development In 1989 when the communists relinquished power Poland had only one motorway Major road projects requiring wildlife impact studies began after Poland joined the European Union in 2004 The country now has one of the highest densities in the world of overhead crossings and underpasses for wild animals Attitudes have also changed For many years hunting was cultural In 1975 there were fewer than 100 wolves in Poland Beginning in the 1950s hunting wolves had been encouraged by the authorities They paid a reward for killing a wolf worth a months salary It was carnage Mysajek says the improvement in Polish wolves survival chances has been considerable but remains fragile Packs are mobile across borders and hunting still goes on in neighbouring Russia Lithuania Belarus Ukraine and Slovakia He claims Polands new government elected in October 2015 is hostile to wolves The Environment Minister Jan Szyszko makes no secret of being a hunter There are 120000 licensed hunters in Poland and they are in uential in parliament The hunters claim wolves are a pest and that there are 4000 of them in Poland which is a spurious gure based on an unscienti c count This government is capable of turning back the clock Being a wolf advocate is not easy It is not as if you can argue to the politicians that wolves are a big tourist attraction Most tourists want to see the animals but wolves stay away from humans They have a tremendously sensitive sense of smell The 12 British animal science students leave the Polish Carpathians without a wolf sighting just photographs of paw prints and droppings Entwisle is convinced that Scotland will never be able to match Polands success It would be amazing for the environment to have them back because of the problem of too many deer But it would just not be viable because of the roads and sheep There would be problems with farmers We had our industrial revolution too long ago We ruined it for ourselves In Britain we like predators to be far away and to watch them on television said Entwisle,Robert Mysajek stops Between two paw prints on a muddy mountain track the scientist nds what he is looking for Droppings he says happily It is so rare to see a wolf that seeing faeces makes it a good day But it is getting easier There are now about 1500 wolves in Poland The number has doubled in 15 years Wolves are along with the brown bear the lynx and the wolverine Europes last large predator carnivores Conservationists from Britain Germany and the Netherlands are coming here to nd out how the country has saved wolves who are criticized even in fairy tales Bits of bone and hair stick out from the black faeces It ate a red deer says Mysajek the University of Warsaw biologist In my lab I can tell you all about this wolf not only its diet but its gender sexual habits age state of health and family connections DNA tests have shown that Polish wolves are travellers One wolf reached the Netherlands where unfortunately it was hit by a car They have a very big range They need space The average territory required by a Polish pack is 250 square kilometres says Mysajek Can we ever reintroduce wolves to Scotland asks student Alex Entwisle 23 on a study trip to southern Poland from the UK He and other animal science students have spent the day looking for droppings and paw prints in the Beskidy mountains of the Polish Carpathians Their hot discussion topic is whether to reintroduce wolves to the British Isles for the rst time since the 18th century Mysajek toured the Scottish Highlands in 2015 for the Wolves and Humans Foundation and answered questions from villagers about the Polish experience The big difference between Scotland and Poland is that we eat pork We do not have many sheep here The similarity is that we have a lot of animals 300000 red deer and more than 800000 roe deer In Poland we also have too many wild boar about 200000 and these are eating and destroying farmers cereal crops Here wolves are part of the solution he says The scientist says wolves can move up to 30 kilometres during a single hunt The Beskidy pack is a strong unit eight or nine animals This year we have recorded ve cubs two young wolves and two adults We track them using motion cameras in the forest and by following their prints in the mud and snow In each family group only one pair of adults has cubs each year All pack members care for the young Mysajek the son of a shepherd doesnt understand wolves bad reputation Why did we have to have the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood with its big bad wolf He is fascinated by these aloof animals who remained in the wild 33000 years ago when others decided on a much more comfortable life as domestic dogs Mysajek says only scienti c arguments the need to regenerate forests and control the wild animal population can save Europes wild carnivores especially the unpopular wolf Natural predators balance the ecosystem They reduce the number of herbivores which allows trees to grow tall for birds to nest in The ban on wolf hunting in the western Carpathians became law in 1995 and in the whole of Poland in 1998 There are now wolf packs in nearly all the countrys major forests where the wolves coexist with humans The Polish government pays compensation for farm animals killed by wolves Mysajek advises farmers to put up electric fences He has helped bring back the use of two deterrents that for reasons no one understands wolves nd very scary strings of small red ags that you hang around sheep pens and the Tatra Mountain Sheepdog Polands wolves have been helped by the countrys late infrastructure development In 1989 when the communists left power

178,Scientists have created an atlas of the brain that reveals how the meanings of words are arranged across different regions of the organ Like a colourful quilt laid over the cortex the atlas displays in rainbow hues how individual words and the concepts they convey can be grouped together in clumps of white matter Our goal was to build a giant atlas that shows how one speci c aspect of language is represented in the brain in this case semantics or the meanings of words said Jack Gallant a neuroscientist at the University of California Berkeley No single brain region holds one word or concept A single brain spot is associated with a number of related words And each single word lights up many different brain spots Together they make up networks that represent the meanings of each word we use life and love death and taxes clouds Florida and bra All light up their own networks Described as a tour de force by one researcher who was not involved in the study the atlas demonstrates how modern imaging can transform our knowledge of how the brain performs some of its most important tasks With further advances the technology could have a profound impact on medicine and other elds It is possible that this approach could be used to decode information about what words a person is hearing reading or possibly even thinking said Alexander Huth the rst author on the study One potential use would be a language decoder that could allow people silenced by motor neurone disease or lockedin syndrome to speak through a computer To create the atlas the scientists recorded peoples brain activity while they listened to stories read out on The Moth Radio Hour a US radio show They then matched the transcripts of the stories with the brain activity data to show how groups of related words triggered neural responses in 50000 to 80000 peasized spots all over the cerebral cortex Huth used stories from The Moth Radio Hour because they are short and compelling The more enthralling the stories the more con dent the scientists could be that the people being scanned were focusing on the words and not drifting off Seven people listened to two hours of stories each Per person that amounted to hearing roughly 25000 words and more than 3000 different words as they lay in the scanner The atlas shows how words and related terms exercise the same regions of the brain For example on the lefthand side of the brain above the ear is one of the tiny regions that represents the word victim The same region responds to killed convicted murdered and confessed On the brains righthand side near the top of the head is one of the brain spots activated by family terms wife husband children parents Each word is represented by more than one spot because words tend to have several meanings One part of the brain for example reliably responds to the word top along with other words that describe clothing But the word top activates many other regions One of them responds to numbers and measurements another to buildings and places The scientists have created an interactive website where the public can explore the brain atlas Strikingly the brain atlases were similar for all the participants suggesting that their brains organized the meanings of words in the same way The scientists only scanned ve men and two women however All are native English speakers and two are authors of the study published in Nature It is highly possible that people from different backgrounds and cultures will have different semantic brain atlases Armed with the atlas researchers can now piece together the brain networks that represent wildly different concepts from numbers to murder and religion The idea of murder is represented a lot in the brain Gallant said Using the same data the group has begun work on new atlases that show how the brain holds information on other aspects of language from phonemes to syntax A brain atlas for narrative structure has so far proved elusive however Every time we come up with a set of narrative features we get told they arent the right set of narrative features said Gallant Uri Hasson a neuroscientist at Princeton University praised the work Unlike many studies that looked at brain activity when an isolated word or sentence was spoken Gallants team had shed light on how the brain worked in a real world scenario he said The next step he added was to create a more comprehensive and precise semantic brain atlas Ultimately Hasson believes it will be possible to reconstruct the words a person is thinking from their brain activity The ethical implications are enormous One more benign use would see brain activity used to assess whether political messages have been effectively communicated to the public There are so many implications and we are barely touching the surface he said Lorraine Tyler a cognitive neuroscientist and head of the Centre for Speech Language and the Brain at Cambridge University said the research was a tour de force in its scope and methods But the brain atlas in its current form does not capture ne differences in word meanings While this research is pathbreaking in its scope there is still a lot to

86,Every morning before the temperatures in Indias capital start to rise a handful of old friends gather On the parched grass not far from the India Gate monument at the centre of Delhi they stretch breathe and meditate It is the only healthy way to start the day Much better than an egg or a sandwich or a cup of tea said Arvind Singh at 615am as he did his breathing exercises on a bench Singh a 42yearold salesman and his friends are far from alone All across India in the overcrowded cities on whatever green space is left similar scenes are being played out On 21 June the new International Day of Yoga Narendra Modi Indias prime minister hopes the world will join in The grass near India Gate will be transformed into the venue for what it is hoped will be the biggest single yoga session ever held with up to 45000 people running through a 35minute routine The participants will include 64yearold Modi most of his government and they hope a range of celebrities Officials have been sent to round up volunteers from scores of countries to reinforce the international credentials of the ancient Indian practice Getting Indians and others stretching has emerged as something of a focus for Modi who led his Bharatiya Janata Party BJP to a landslide election victory in 2014 In May 2015 schools were directed to make sure students attended yoga events timed to coincide with the big demonstration in Delhi even though it is being held on a Sunday Officials have already signalled the introduction of compulsory yoga for Indias famously outofshape police officers and said that daily yoga lessons would be offered free to three million civil servants and their families Air India the national carrier has also said it will introduce yoga for trainee pilots More controversially senior politicians in India have suggested more widespread practice of yoga could bring down soaring levels of sexual violence in the country Modi an ascetic who is a committed vegetarian and an enthusiastic yoga practitioner himself suggested an international yoga day when speaking to the United Nations on a visit to New York in 2014 Yoga is an invaluable gift of Indias ancient tradition It embodies unity of mind and body thought and action restraint and fulfilment harmony between man and nature a holistic approach to health and wellbeing It is not about exercise but discovering the sense of oneness with yourself the world and nature Modi said at the time adding that yoga could help in tackling climate change The discipline is between 3000 and 6000 years old and originated somewhere on the Indian subcontinent possibly among religious ascetics Its meditative practices as well as its physical exercises have long been associated with local religious traditions including Buddhism and Jainism as well as the Hinduism practised by 80 of Indians Modi who started his career as an organizer for a hardline Hindu nationalist organization has been previously criticized for promoting a view of Indian culture that has little place for other traditions One commentator called the event on 21 June a mix of cultural nationalism commercialization and subtle coercion Novelist Ajaz Ashraf wrote on Indias Scroll website Underlying it is the hope of bringing into the BJP tent the modernday gurus and their teeming followers who largely constitute the urban middle classes Others however point to a recent US court ruling that said yoga was not inevitably linked to faith A court in California ruled that While the practice of yoga may be religious in some contexts yoga classes as taught in the San Diego district are as the trial court determined devoid of any religious mystical or spiritual trappings This came after two parents claimed yoga in schools promoted Hinduism and inhibited Christianity Amish Tripathi the author of bestselling novels set 4000 years ago in India that retell stories from Hindu mythology said characters in his books practise yoga In ancient India it was part of daily life both the physical and the mental aspects Every culture has gifted something to the world and this is our gift Tripathi said Suneel Singh a guru in south Delhi agreed that yoga did

39,The last time she took to the stage the prototype of the mobile phone was undergoing its first trials Thirtyfive years later as she performs once again singer Kate Bush is faced with a different world While most concerts are now aglow with phones and tablets Bush is taking a stand against fans watching her shows through the digital veil of a screen Prior to her highly anticipated series of concerts at the Hammersmith Apollo in London Bush released a statement appealing to her fans to put down their mobile phones at her gigs Bush wrote on her website I have a request for all of you who are coming to the shows We have purposefully chosen an intimate theatre setting rather than a large venue or stadium It would mean a great deal to me if you would please refrain from taking photos or filming during the shows I very much want to have contact with you as an audience not with iPhones iPads or cameras I know its a lot to ask but it would allow us to all share in the experience together With her love of theatrics and opulent costumes Bushs keenness to stop fans uploading grainy footage to YouTube could also be an attempt to keep the show a surprise for the thousands of fans who have purchased tickets for the 22 dates she is playing Bush is not the first to speak out against the detrimental effect of the presence of phones at concerts with numerous artists berating their fans for experiencing live music through the filter of a screen The Who front man Roger Daltrey recently said it was weird that people did not have their mind on the show when they had gone to a performance and were concentrating on staring at the screen rather than the artist on stage He said I feel sorry for them I really feel sorry for them Looking at life through a screen and not being in the moment totally if youre doing that youre 50 there right Its weird I find it weird In 2013 Beyonc berated one of her fans at a gig for filming You cant even sing because youre too busy taping Beyonc told him Im right in your face baby You gotta seize this moment Put that damn camera down The debate around the presence of phones at live events is not restricted to music with sport fans equally vocal on the subject Recently Dutch fans at PSV Eindhoven launched a vehement protest against the introduction of wifi in their stadium holding up banners with messages like No wifi Support the team You can sit at home and Stand united while Manchester United have also told fans to leave their large electronic devices at home prohibiting filming on tablets this season Jarvis Cocker has previously criticized phonewielders in the audience for driving him insane at concerts adding It seems stupid to have something happening in front of you and look at it on a screen thats smaller than the size of a cigarette packet Johnny Marr said in 2013 that it meant that fans missed out on the sensory experience of live music in their desperation to document the event for later To stand and just be looking at it through your phone is a completely wasted opportunity You know I dont mean to be unkind but I think you should put your phone down because youre just being an idiot really Just enjoy the gig he said Thats one of the things about gigs its taking in whats going on with the people around you and watching it on a little screen its a waste of time The Yeah Yeah Yeahs resorted to putting up a sign at one of their venues pleading with fans to pocket their technology It read Please do not watch the show through a screen on your smart devicecamera Put it away as a courtesy to the person behind you and to the band It has even filtered into the world of classical music with one of the worlds leading pianists surprising concertgoers in June 2013 when he stormed off stage because a fan was filming his performance on a smartphone Krystian Zimerman returned moments later and declared The destruction of music because of YouTube is enormous But Sam Watt of Vyclone a phone app that encourages audiences to film at concerts and then brings together the footage to create a crowdsourced video of the event said that such artists were fighting a losing battle and that filming at concerts enhanced rather than detracted from the experience Fans filming is now part of the concert experience that is a just a fact so we take that footage that people are filming at concerts through the app they upload it onto the app and then it comes back to them mixed together with everybody else who was filming You end up with really fantastic content he said Our overall thinking is that filming at concerts adds to the experience rather than taking away from it and I think if Kate Bush came round for a cup of tea we could have a really interesting discussion about this and we might be able to win her round he added Knowing that people are going to film and want those memories is really important because it is probably going to hit them on the head in the future if they say to

109,The view from the visitors centre at the southern edge of Donana National Park in southern Spain is striking to say the least This is an ornithologists dream 200000 hectares of salt marsh of unrivalled importance to the birdlife of western Europe Dozens of Britains most loved migratory birds including house martins swallows cuckoos and warblers rest here on their annual migrations from Africa Donana a UN World Heritage Site is also home to some of Europes rarest birds including the Spanish imperial eagle while its mammalian inhabitants include the highly endangered Iberian lynx It is a glorious vibrant landscape Yet it exists on a knifeedge a point illustrated dramatically in 1998 when almost two billion gallons of contaminated highly acidic water mixed with waste metals poured into the park from a dam that had burst its bank at Los Frailes mine 45km to the north A toxic tsunami of waste poured down the Guadiamar river and over its banks leaving a thick metallic crust over a vast stretch of parkland More than 25000 kilos of dead sh were collected in the aftermath and nearly 2000 adult birds chicks eggs and nests were killed or destroyed It was Spains worst environmental disaster and the cleanup cost 90m Suddenly aware of Donanas status as the nations most important natural site Spain decided to spend a further 360m some of it EU money on restoring the landscape which in the 1950s and 60s had been drained in places to create rice and cotton elds Some of this farmland is now being returned to its original wetland state It has been a costly but encouraging process Yet the fate of Donana still hangs in the balance thanks to the increasing pressures of modern life Plans have been outlined to build an oil pipeline through Donana while other developers have announced proposals to expand local tourist resorts whose new hotels and golf courses would demand water supplies that would further erode the local table Silt washed from nearby farms is also choking the channels that crisscross Donana However the real body blow for conservationists has been the recent decision of the Andalucian government to reopen the Frailes mine that so very nearly destroyed Donana in 1998 This is Europes most precious bird sanctuary both in terms of indigenous species and also as a resting place for birds that migrate between Africa and Britain and other parts of northwest Europe says Laurence Rose of the RSPB Royal Society for the Protection of Birds Donana already faces a great number of threats but now they want to bring back the very cause of its nearundoing 16 years ago It is extremely worrying Having spent so much restoring Donana to its past glories it might seem strange that the local government should choose to announce that it wants mining companies to tender bids to rework Los Frailes However a brief examination of the state of the local economy provides an explanation The crash of Spains banks in 2008 hit the region catastrophically and unemployment in some parts of Andalucia is now more than 30 Reopening the mine would provide more than 1000 precious jobs There are riches here riches that are badly needed by local inhabitants said Vicente Fernandez Guerrero secretarygeneral of Innovation Industry and Energy for Andalucia We think mining is a good way to make it possible to allow local people to continue to live in the area This is a mining area People have been digging metals and ores here since Roman times after all More to the point added Fernandez the mine licence would stipulate that only modern mining techniques which avoid the creation of poisonous wet waste would be allowed It has also stipulated that the Canadian company that ran Los Frailes cannot bid for the contract Sixteen years after the accident the two sides remained locked over compensation claims The best technology in the world will be used here Fernandez insisted Liquid will not be used We are going to insist on that Our tender makes that clear The proposal has some support in the area but it also has a lot of opposition One road sign I passed was liberally daubed with obscenities about the workers union UGT which supports the mines reopening For his part Carlos Davila who works for the Spanish Ornithological Society in Donana was also alarmed at the proposal This is a very very bad idea indeed he told me They say the new mine will be safe but they said it was safe in 1998 and look what happened We got the worst ecological disaster in the history of Spain What alarms people such as Davila is the threat that a new mine poses to the intense investment in ecotourism that has been made in Donana in recent years An example is provided at the restaurant Dehesa de Abajo where you can have a drink or a meal surrounded by trees in which storks and black kites are nesting Virtually every visitor was equipped with a camera and telescopic lens or a pair of binoculars There is a clear tourist trade to be made from the birdlife of Donana Nor should this be surprising for this is a truly special place A vast hemisphere of sky hangs over this utterly at but certainly not featureless landscape Birds of every shape and size ll the air and sometimes the road At one point on my visit a stork calmly stood in front of our car until it felt ready to y off The trouble is that Spain does not have the public resources it possessed 16 years ago A repeat of the toxin spill today would have a much much more damaging impact said Rose This point is backed by Davila After the disaster Spain woke up to the fact that it possessed a place of real ecological importance and did a lot to clean it up and protect it he added Now we seem to be forgetting that lesson It is very depressing,The view from the visitors centre at the southern edge of Donana National Park in southern Spain is an ornithologists dream 200000 hectares of wetlands vital for the birdlife of western Europe Dozens of Britains most loved migratory birds rest here every year on their migrations from Africa Donana is also home to some of Europes rarest birds including the Spanish imperial eagle It is a glorious vibrant landscape but it exists on a knifeedge In 1998 almost two billion gallons of acidic water mixed with waste metals poured into the park from the Los Frailes mine 45km away A toxic tsunami of waste poured down the Guadiamar river into the park More than 25000 kilos of dead sh were collected afterwards and nearly 2000 adult birds chicks eggs and nests were killed or destroyed It was Spains worst environmental disaster and the cleanup cost 90m Suddenly aware of Donanas status as the nations most important natural site Spain decided to spend a further 360m some of it EU money on restoring the landscape In the 1950s and 60s some parts of this landscape had been drained to create rice and cotton elds Some of this farmland is now being returned to its original wetland state It has been a costly but positive process But Donana is still in trouble thanks to the increasing pressures of modern life There are plans to build an oil pipeline through Donana and other developers want to build new hotels and golf courses which would need enormous water supplies Sand and soil washed from nearby farms is also blocking the channels that cross Donana However the real body blow for conservationists has been the recent decision of the Andalucian government to reopen the Frailes mine that nearly destroyed Donana in 1998 This is Europes most precious bird sanctuary for indigenous species and also as a resting place for birds that migrate between Africa and Britain and other parts of northwest Europe says Laurence Rose of the RSPB Royal Society for the Protection of Birds Donana already faces a large number of threats but now they want to bring back the very cause of the disaster 16 years ago It is extremely worrying The state of the local economy provides an explanation for the governments decision The crash of Spains banks in 2008 had a catastrophic effect on the region and unemployment in some parts of Andalucia is now more than 30 Reopening the mine would provide more than 1000 jobs There are riches here riches that are badly needed by local inhabitants said energy spokesman Vicente Fernandez Guerrero We think mining is a good way to make it possible to allow local people to continue to live in the area This is a mining area People have been digging metals here since Roman times Fernandez said that the mine licence would only allow modern mining techniques which avoid the creation of poisonous wet waste Also the Canadian company that ran Los Frailes when the disaster happened cannot run it again The best technology in the world will be used here Fernandez insisted Liquid will not be used We are going to insist on that The plan has some support in the area but it also has a lot of opposition Carlos Davila who works for the Spanish Ornithological Society in Donana was also alarmed at the plan This is a very very bad idea he said They say the new mine will be safe but they said it was safe in 1998 and look what happened We got the worst ecological disaster in the history of Spain Almost every visitor at a local restaurant had a camera and telescopic lens or a pair of binoculars There is a big tourist trade because of the birdlife of Donana This is not surprising because this is a very special place A huge sky hangs over this at but certainly not boring landscape Birds of every shape and size ll the air and sometimes the road At one point on my visit a stork calmly stood in front of our car until it felt ready to y off The trouble is that Spain does not have the public resources it had 16 years ago A repeat of the toxin spill today would

28,In Canadas Arctic summers are marked by a bright light that bathes the treeless tundra for more than 20 hours a day For some its a welcome change from the unrelenting darkness of winter But for the small but growing Muslim community of Iqaluit Nunavut life in the land of the midnight sun poses a real challenge during the month of Ramadan during which Muslims typically fast from sunrise to sunset I havent fainted once said 29yearold Abdul Karim one of the few in the city who has carefully timed his Ramadan fast to the Arctic sun since moving from Ottawa in 2011 This year that means eating at about 130am before the sun rises and breaking his fast at about 11pm when the sun sets The only reason to stop would be if it hurts my health Karim said Pointing to his sizable frame he laughed as he added But looking at my condition I dont think fasting will hurt me As the end of Ramadan draws near for Muslims around the world much of the holy months focus on community work prayer and reflection has been a constant in communities around the world But in Iqaluit and the other Muslim communities in the Arctic the long days have forced a shift in how the element of fasting is approached Most in Iqaluit adhere to the timetable followed by Muslims in Ottawa some 1300 miles south of the city following the advice of Muslim scholars who have said Muslims in the far north should observe Ramadan using the timetable of Mecca or the nearest Muslim city It still means fasting for some 18 hours a day said Atif Jilani who moved to Iqaluit from Toronto in 2015 Its long days but more manageable Many in the 100strong community break their fast together gathering in the citys brand new mosque completed in February amid temperatures that dropped as low as 50C with wind chill for nightly suppers As they tuck into traditional foods such as dates and goat or lamb curries the sun shines brightly through the windows Its a scene that plays out across Canadas northernmost mosques during Ramadan as Muslim communities wrestle with the countrys unique geography The 300 or so Muslims in Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories have several options when it comes to fasting during Ramadan said Nazim Awan president of the Yellowknife Islamic Centre with exceptions made for those who are pregnant or ill There might be some superhumans who want to fast for 23 hours but the other option is to follow the intent and spirit of fasting by following nearby cities or they can follow the times of Mecca and Medina In recent years much of the community has opted to follow the Ramadan timetable of Edmonton in Alberta Some such as Awan a father of two young children including a 12yearold who recently started fasting follow the timings of Mecca He hopes to encourage his son with the more manageable timetable of about 15 hours of fasting as compared with about 18 hours in Edmonton If I fast Yellowknife or Edmonton times my son might say Papa you are really insane What are you doing he said Faced with the impossibility of following the local movements of the sun the 100 or so Muslims in Inuvik a small town that sits 125 miles north of the Arctic Circle have also been following Edmontons timetable We currently have 24 hours a day of sun said Ahmad Alkhalaf Theres no sunrise or sunset The adherence to Edmontons schedule was already in place in 2001 when he moved from Toronto to the small northern community of 3500 people My first Ramadan here was in December Theres no sun at that time its dark all day and night So we used Edmonton time At times it can be psychologically challenging to follow the clock rather than what is happening outside Alkhalaf said Youre supposed to break your fast when its dusk and we eat when the sun is out Its not usual to have iftar the meal breaking the fast when the sun is up he said In Inuvik where much of the population is Inuit the Muslim community has sought to strike a balance between Ramadan and the local culture and traditions The iftar meal includes dates and rich curries as well as local game such as reindeer prepared in accordance with Islamic law We make a soup or curry but instead of using beef we use reindeer In Iqaluit as the Muslim community prepares to mark the end of Ramadan some reflect that 2016s timing stretching across some of the longest days of the year has made it one of the more challenging of recent years Its particularly true for those like Karim who have determinedly followed the local sunrise and sunset But his efforts will be rewarded years from now said Karim thanks to the lunar calendar Ramadan will eventually fall during winter which in Iqaluit sees the sun rise and set within a few hours each day Ill follow those hours too he said with a laugh Oh yes definitely,In the Arctic regions of Canada the summer sun shines for more than 20 hours a day For some its a welcome change from the constant darkness of winter But for the small but growing Muslim community of Iqaluit Nunavut life in the land of the midnight sun is a real challenge during the month of Ramadan when Muslims typically fast from sunrise to sunset I havent fainted once said 29yearold Abdul Karim one of

173,The continual relegation of women to the sidelines of football was given a good kicking when France appointed its first female professional team manager It did not matter that it was a seconddivision club It did not matter if it was as some bad sports male of course suggested just a cynical stunt to drum up publicity for a minor team Clermont Foot 63 currently ranking a lowly 14th out of 20 in its league What mattered was that Helena Costa had been given the top job a move that saw her make football history by becoming the first female manager to be appointed in the highest two divisions of any professional European league As a woman its made me happy Vronique Soulier president of the clubs supporters association told journalists When I first heard the news I was rather surprised but once that passed we were pretty unanimous that its good news We all agree that a woman at the head of a group of men is no bad thing The new manager of Clermont Foot 63 whose average home crowd at the stadium at Clermont Ferrand in the Auvergne region of southcentral France is around 3800 is a former talent spotter for the Scottish Premiership side Celtic Costa 36 was born in Alhandra on the River Tagus in southeast Portugal and graduated with a masters degree in sports science She is also a UEFAlicensed coach She previously coached Benficas male youth teams the Qatar womens team which she led to its first international victory in 2012 and more recently the Iranian womens national side which she left in September 2013 Costa was appointed on a twoyear contract by the president of Clermont Foot 63 Claude Michy who is a champion at grabbing the headlines for his club In 2013 he announced the team had signed Messi They had Not the Argentinian and FC Barcelona recordbreaking striker Lionel Messi but Junior Messi Enguene a 20yearold midfielder from Cameroon Frances womens minister Najat Vallaud Belkacem tweeted Bravo to Clermont Foot for understanding that giving women a place is the future of professional football Carolina Morace an Italian who was the only previous woman coach of a mens professional team said I dont know Helena but if she has been hired by a team then it means that she knows how to do her job I hope that one day this can become normal Morace was an outstanding player in the womens game She was the top scorer for 12 seasons in Italys Serie A and played for Italy in 153 internationals In 1999 she was named as the coach of Viterbese in the mens Serie C1 But after only two games she resigned from the job following a clash with the clubs mercurial proprietor Luciano Gaucci who at the time was also the owner of a Serie A side Perugia Morace was quoted as saying that she had refused Gauccis demand that she fire her deputy and the sides trainer He let me know that I could carry on working with whomever I wanted But by then mutual trust was lacking and I didnt fancy carrying on in that climate of uncertainty she said Morace works today as a lawyer in Rome and as expert soccer commentator on television and in the pages of the daily Gazzetta dello Sport She said For the time being I see too many men even in the womens game who are working despite not having the same expertise as women who by contrast are not working Raymond Domenech former manager of the French national team said Women know how to play football and how to manage and are good at doing it Why shouldnt they manage mens teams The opposite happens and doesnt cause any problems Its a natural choice and reflects our society in which women are equal to men I say well done to President Michy I told myself that if I took charge of a club again Id hire a woman as my number two He beat me to it A statement on Clermont Foot 63s website said Costas appointment would allow the club to enter a new era On the club supporters website reaction to Costas appointment was a mix of surprise and a certain cynicism In my opinion its just a publicity stunt to get people talking about the club and she wont last the season I find it hard to believe shell be able to get the players respect above all when shes the same age as the oldest wrote one fan Her CV isnt bad but now the question is will she be good enough added another A third wrote I wish her welcome and success but I think itll be hard for her to make her mark as a woman in such a macho business Has our president pulled off a media coup But Soulier was hopeful Hopefully with the new manager the club can find the motivation theyre lacking at the moment she said The boys in the team can be difficult to manage With a woman in charge maybe theyll be less demanding If Costas reputation is anything to go by she will be the one making the demands After doing work experience at Chelsea during her compatriot Jos Mourinhos first stint as manager of the club between 2004 and 2007 she was reportedly described as Mourinho in a skirt Costa quickly kicked the sexist remark into touch Like Mourinho I always want to win As far as thats concerned yes Im happy to be compared with him she said,Women have traditionally played a minor role in professional football but this may be changing

60,Back in 2005 when BlackBerry brought instant messaging to the mobile phone the company was just entering its boom times While the iPhone was still a gleam in Steve Jobss eye BlackBerrys innovations ensured its smartphone was one of Canadas biggest exports Six years later in the summer of 2011 as violence engulfed London and spread to Birmingham Nottingham Liverpool and Manchester so effective was BlackBerry Messenger BBM at mobilizing the rioters that politicians called for the service to be temporarily shut down But two years later it is the users themselves who are pulling the plug As demand for BlackBerry handsets fades the once noisy BBM grapevine is falling silent Dozens of alternatives have sprung up to take its place from Facebooks and Apples ownbrand instant messaging applications to independent startups such as WhatsApp and Kik which is also Canadian Free to download and use they use the internet to swap text messages pictures voice clips stickers and even videos in WhatsApps case between most types of phones In an attempt to retain its following BBM has been released on Android and Apple phones Despite the competition the response has been overwhelming with an announcement that there have been more than 20 million downloads But despite the initial interest many believe BBMs wider release will do little to save the service The move to bring BlackBerry to the iPhone is four or five years too late says James Gooderson an 18yearold student who blogs on technology WhatsApp has removed the reason why young people would use a BlackBerry BBM claims 80 million monthly users after its upgrade but WhatsApp has 300 million Other services expose BBMs limitations unlike Skype and Viber it does not yet offer video or voice calls unlike Path it does not do location sharing there is no video sharing as on iMessage and the stickers a more sophisticated version of the smiley face adored by kids the world over are also unforgivably absent Even the contacts and calendar sharing that BBM made possible on BlackBerry handsets have not migrated to the Apple and Android versions Messaging is moving from verbal to visual Photos uploaded to Instagram trigger a wave of comments and Snapchats pictures which selfdelete after ten seconds have opened a world of other possibilities Like BBM all of these services are free for any phone with an internet connection Yet as recently as 2011 BBM was so powerful it was credited with starting a revolution in Egypt and at the time of the London riots it was a more urgent source of news than the television screen We could see on our BlackBerry messages where the rioters were going next TV news would catch up four hours later said Jean Pierre Moore 28 He manages a youth club in Stockwell south London an area with some of the highest levels of crime and economic deprivation in Britain Moore mainly communicates on an iPad now He dismisses the notion that the BBM curfew urged by some MPs would have stopped the looting The social networking wasnt the reason he says I know a lot of people who were out rioting People had been angry for a long time Mention the words stop and search around here and you immediately have a room full of angry young men Nearly 80 of young smartphone owners regularly use a social networking application says the research firm Enders Analysis but twothirds use more than one Among 16 to 24yearolds 60 use Facebook every day but 46 use alternatives Its a much more complex multifaceted environment says Benedict Evans a digital media specialist at Enders The smartphone itself has become the platform All of these apps plug into your phone book and your photo library Apps rise and fall like fireworks Some like Instagram last others disappear into thin air

without parents he says Facebook has been taken over by the older generation Once I saw my mum on Facebook I deleted my account For families that may struggle to pay their heating bills this winter the low price tag attached to buying and communicating on a BlackBerry retains its appeal Unlimited BBM messages are available to anyone with a secondhand device and a 7amonth deal from TMobile But trust in the privacy of BBMs system has been eroded Part of the attraction to business people revolutionaries demonstrators and rioters was a belief that encrypted words sent over the companys secure

104,Male bosses are being paid bonuses double the size of those given to female colleagues in identical jobs a disparity that means men enjoy salary topups of 141500 more than women over the course of a working lifetime The figures released by the Chartered Management Institute CMI reveal that men in UK management roles earned average bonuses of 6442 in 2012 compared with 3029 for women In the most senior roles female directors received bonuses of 36270 over the past 12 months compared with 63700 awarded to male directors The latest figures highlighting the inequitable nature of pay in British business led to calls for action from campaigners on workplace equality Ann Francke the CMIs chief executive said Its time to move this issue into the mainstream management agenda This is about changing our approach to management to allow for greater flexibility less masculine cultures more emphasis on outcomes rather than time in the office and greater transparency around performance and rewards In solving this issue we would actually raise the performance of organizations and the wellbeing of individuals at work What are we waiting for Dr Ruth Sealy a senior research fellow at Cranfield School of Management added It is not surprising Bonuses are a method of payment that can be used with discretion As to what should be done about it these things should be made more transparent While statisticians warned that some of the data may be skewed by factors such as women entering occupations where there is less of a culture of bonus payments the discrepancies in the sizes of awards do appear to be aggravating Britains pay gap which the government says is closing but still sees fulltime male employees earn 10 more than women Maria Miller the Minister for Women and Equalities said The CMI figures are yet another damaging example highlighting that in the world of work women still lose out to their male counterparts and that the playing field is far from level Changes in the workplace are happening and its good that the pay gap is closing but there is still more to do before we see full equality in the workplace The government is playing its part we have made pay secrecy clauses illegal given tribunals the power to force employers who break equal pay laws to carry out equal pay audits and signed 120 companies up to our Think Act Report scheme which encourages companies to improve the way they recruit promote and pay women Weve also looked at other pay gap causes such as having to juggle work and family responsibilities by introducing shared parental leave and the right to request flexible working to all employees Large companies such as Tesco BT Unilever and the international law firm Eversheds are among those signed up to Think Act Report The scheme has only attracted 120 supporters in nearly two years of existence having risen from 54 participants in November 2012 However the CMIs data did provide some evidence to support Millers contention that the overall pay gap is narrowing the difference between the average salaries earned by male and female bosses has appeared to shrink decreasing from an average of 10060 in 2012 to 8502 in the CMIs most recent figures However the institute cautioned against direct comparisons between the 2012 and 2013 samples which both polled around 40000 managers as they are not identical A subset of 17000 individual managers whose salaries and bonuses have been tracked over a number of years showed that male managers earnings are rising faster than womens for the first time in five years with men enjoying total increases of 32 compared with 28 for women when salaries and bonuses are combined At the most senior level male directors earnings rose by 53 over the past 12 months compared with just 11 for female directors,Male bosses are paid bonuses double the size of those given to female colleagues in identical jobs This means that men get salary topups of 141500 more than women over their working lives The figures released by the Chartered Management Institute CMI reveal that men in UK management roles earned average bonuses of 6442 in 2012 compared with 3029 for women In the most senior roles female directors received bonuses of 36270 over the past 12 months compared with 63700 awarded to male directors The latest figures show that pay in British business is still not equal This has led to calls for action from campaigners on workplace equality Ann Francke the CMIs chief executive said Its time to move this issue into the mainstream management agenda This is about changing our approach to management There should be greater flexibility less masculine cultures more emphasis on outcomes rather than time in the office and greater transparency around performance and rewards In solving this issue we would actually raise the performance of organizations and the wellbeing of individuals at work What are we waiting for While some of the data may be affected by factors such as women doing jobs where there is less of a culture of bonus payments the differences in the sizes of bonuses do appear to make Britains pay gap worse The government says the pay gap is closing but that fulltime male employees still earn 10 more than women Maria Miller the Minister for Women and Equalities said The CMI figures are another example from the world of work

in the workplace The government is playing its part We have signed up 120 companies to our Think Act Report scheme which encourages companies to improve the way they recruit promote and pay women Weve also looked at other pay gap causes such as having to juggle work and family responsibilities We have introduced shared parental leave and the right to request flexible working to all employees Large companies such as Tesco BT Unilever and the international law firm Eversheds are among those signed up to Think Act Report The scheme has only attracted 120 supporters in nearly two years of existence However the CMIs data did provide some evidence to support Millers statement that the overall pay gap is narrowing the difference between the average salaries earned by male and female bosses appeared to shrink from 2012 A subset of 17000 individual managers whose salaries and bonuses have been followed over a number of years showed that male managers earnings are rising faster than womens for the first time in five years Mens earnings increased by 32 compared with a 28 increase for women when salaries and bonuses are combined At the most senior level male directors earnings rose by 53 over the past 12 months compared with just 11 for female directors,train,ADV,INT
118,Like veins carrying the lifeblood of a city a subway system teems with billions of inhabitants the bacteria of Swiss cheese and kimchi of bubonic plague and drugproof bugs and of human skin Now for the rst time scientists have started to catalogue and map the bacteria coursing through a citys subway and they have found a wealth of curious results Dr Christopher Mason a geneticist at Weill Cornell Medical College led a team that for 18 months swabbed the New York City subway system for the microscopic life forms that cover its turnstiles seats ticket booths and stations In what Mason called the rst cityscale genetic pro le ever his team found meningitis at Times Square a trace of anthrax on the handhold of a train carriage and bacteria that cause bubonic plague on a rubbish bin and ticket machine at stations in uptown Manhattan In research published in the journal Cell Systems the team strongly downplayed the ndings of plague and anthrax noting the extremely small trace of the latter that rats likely carried the former and that no one has fallen ill with plague in or around New York for years The results do not suggest that plague or anthrax is prevalent the study says Nor do they suggest that New York residents are at risk In fact most of the bacteria identi ed by the team are either harmless to humans or bene cial in the citys thriving world of microorganisms many of which process toxic hazards and waste in the same way that bacteria inside every human help with digestion and bodily functions Some of the results were expected Mason said including some bacteria associated with fecal matter which he said should be a gentle reminder for people to wash their hands He also said that many bacteria of the same genus as those that are bene cial and helpful like the one used for making cheese also turned up around New York Bacteria appeared to re ect the eating habits of various neighbourhoods All around the subway bacteria associated with cheeses brie cheddar parmesan and the mozzarella of ubiquitous New York pizza turned up The distinctive bacteria of Swiss cheese were more localized to midtown Manhattan and the nancial district and the bacteria used to ferment cabbage for kimchi and sauerkraut showed up in the nancial district and Bay Ridge The computer also identi ed cucumber DNA all over the city Mason said Bacteria associated with illness and infections were extremely common Species that cause diarrhoea and nausea both benign and bad Ecoli mostly benign and the bacteria that can cause skin infections and urinarytract infections were common all over the city The species that produces tetanus appeared in Soho and bacteria that cause dysentery appeared at a station in the Bronx and another in Harlem With more than 1000 samples collected at all of New Yorks 466 open subway stations Mason and his team ran the organic materials through a DNA sequencer and then through a supercomputer armed with genetic databases They identi ed 15152 distinct species nearly half of which were bacteria The good news the researchers wrote is that these potentially infectious agents are not spreading sickness or disease throughout New York but rather seem to be normal cohabitants and may even be essential They represent a normal healthy metagenome pro le of a city In short the researchers conclude the subway and city are about as safe as everyone thought Mason said people should not be concerned about getting urinarytract infections from subway seats You should wash your hands he said and probably get some sleep and eat salads and go to the gym and thats about the same today as it was yesterday If anything he added Ive become much more con dent riding the subway Many ndings made sense heavily traf cked stations like Grand Central and Times Square had more bacteria and more diversity among them the subway was most enriched for bacteria associated with skin The Bronx with its diverse neighbourhoods and stations had the greatest diversity of bacteria Staten Island with just three stops had the lowest The researchers found marine bacteria at South Ferry a station that ooded during Hurricane Sandy but they were surprised to note the species included some normally associated with Antarctica and fish The next steps Mason said are studies of other cities which have begun in Paris Sao Paolo and Shanghai and continued studies of New York for instance to see how the microbiome changes with the seasons He said he hoped the research would provide a baseline of research for health of cials and geneticists and could help health of cials to be better prepared to prevent and track diseases and pathogens,A subway system has billions of inhabitants the bacteria of Swiss cheese and kimchi bubonic plague and drugproof bugs and

78,Striding on stage Donald Trump had a surprisingly humble confession to make for someone defying all the laws of political gravity Unless we win it doesnt mean a damn thing the wouldbe Republican presidential nominee warned a campaign rally in South Carolina despite nishing his fourth month in a row at the top of the opinion polls I want to pick my date for the election I want it next Tuesday he con ded to the 11000strong crowd typical of the grassroots support that needs to ourish into March 2016 for him to win the nomination let alone Novembers general election Such moments of selfdoubt are eeting quickly replaced by the nowfamiliar bombast of a billionaire whose status as a winner has become his de ning policy platform Trump is not the only one beginning to wonder whether his improbable campaign can confound the pundits and go the distance particularly after a burst of recent controversy only seemed to cement his polling lead over bewildered rivals Conventional wisdom holds that any one of these outbursts would have sunk most politicians by now First there was the time he outraged prisoners of war by doubting the heroism of Vietnam veteran John McCain because he allowed himself to be captured Then there was the rst television debate where he insulted Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly because she asked him dif cult questions As if PoWs Fox News and women were not enemies enough Trump has also insulted Mexican immigrants to the US claimed that a Black Lives Matter protester who was violently ejected from a rally deserved to be roughed up appeared to mock a New York Times journalist for his disability and falsely accused Muslim Americans of cheering on the 911 attackers Trump has complained that many of these incidents were exaggerated by the political media 70 of whom he says are scum But he has nonetheless refused to retract any of the comments I could have said Oh I misspoke but I am not big on that Trump told the crowd in South Carolina Some rivals still hope that eventually even Trumps supporters will tire of what critics view as his relentless attacks on minorities in particular One poll shows his support among Republicans down by 12 points although at 31 he still leads the Other opponents question whether there is much overarching political ideology to Trump He is an egomaniac hes a narcissist Hes not a conservative hes not a liberal he believes in himself former presidential rival Bobby Jindal told the Guardian shortly before dropping out of the Liz Mair a Republican strategist organizing an anti Trump fundraising committee worries that many of the comments seen as gaffes by the liberal media are in fact carefully designed to boost his standing with his core constituency I personally think its best that people who dont like Trump and his policies do some work to try to actively undercut him she says And not just pray for him to commit real political suicide Yet there is more to Trump than attentiongrabbing outrage As he delights in telling supporters the three issues that he rails against most immigration reform freetrade deals and Barack Obamas national security policy have become perhaps the de ning issues of the election His policies for deporting every undocumented immigrant in the US and demanding that Mexico pays for a border wall A real wall A very tall wall taller than that ceiling might sound unrealistic but they have arguably destroyed the campaign hopes of Jeb Bush who favours immigration reform So what might it take to stop Trump One source of optimism among opponents is the strong evidence that polls this far away from election day are an average of eight percentage points out simply because most people have not made up their minds Among Americans who identify as Republicans current polls suggest he has 2530 of the vote In the battle for hearts and minds converting Trumps passionate supporters will be hard To blunt his lead another candidate would need to tap into his support base without jeopardizing their own Polling experts believe this to be unlikely as it is hard to imagine anyone doing Trump better than Trump let alone anyone doing Trump without sacri cing their own support This scenario can be best understood by looking at responses to the question Are there any of these candidates you would de nitely not support for the Republican nomination for

believes Trump speaks for voters who for the rst time feel as if they have a mouthpiece and like the fact that they feel like they are being heard As the pollster notes Trump says what theyre thinking and the more outrageous he is the more they agree with him Hes saying what no politician would say and thats another reason they like him That is certainly the feeling among ordinary supporters who have attended his increasingly packed campaign events in recent months I like the way he speaks says Sandra Murray of Dubuque Iowa This country is a huge mess and we need to get out of this and honestly he could be the man to do it Other supporters offer a simpler explanation Hes not afraid of anybody or anything Thats pretty cool,Unless we win it doesnt mean a damn thing said billionaire

23,A day that began with a fresh round of dawn raids on the Baur Au Lac hotel in Zurich ended with 16 football officials being indicted on corruption charges in the US including five current or former members of FIFAs executive committee They included the notorious former Brazilian federation chief Ricardo Teixeira and his successor Marco Polo Del Nero who has recently stepped down from the FIFA executive committee They were among 16 individuals accused of fraud and other offences by the US Department of Justice as it set out a series of kickback schemes in a new 240page indictment that superseded the previous one in May 2015 It takes to 27 the number of defendants charged by the US with a further 24 unnamed coconspirators including former FIFA executive committee members The betrayal of trust set forth here is outrageous the US Attorney General Loretta Lynch said The scale of corruption alleged herein is completely unacceptable On a day when FIFAs executive committee had hoped to present new reforms in the midst of an ongoing corruption crisis Swiss police led away the president of the South American football confederation the Paraguayan Juan ngel Napout and Alfredo Hawit the head of the North and Central American and Caribbean governing body Hawit only succeeded Jeffrey Webb in May 2015 after Webb was arrested as part of the US operation that threw FIFA into crisis and precipitated the downfall of Sepp Blatter Webbs predecessor the controversial Jack Warner was also seized in May The Swiss Federal Office of Justice said of the latest arrests They are being held in custody pending their extradition According to the US arrest requests they are suspected of accepting bribes of millions of dollars Webb and the Colombian former executive committee member Luis Bedoya were among those whose guilty pleas were entered in the US Lynch said that eight individuals five of them unnamed in the original indictment had come forward with guilty pleas since May Eleven current and former members of FIFAs executive committee have now been charged in the investigation which alleges 200m in bribes mainly as kickbacks from TV and marketing contracts but also FIFAs development programmes The last three presidents of the regional bodies CONCACAF and Conmebol have all been indicted The message from this announcement should be clear to every culpable individual who remains in the shadows hoping to evade our investigation you will not escape our focus said Lynch Teixeira the former soninlaw of the longstanding FIFA president Joo Havelange was charged alongside Del Nero and his predecessor Jos Maria Marin who was charged in May Fourteen men had been charged in May 2015 when four additional guilty pleas were entered Days later Blatter won a fifth term as president but later agreed to step down as the crisis grew He was then provisionally suspended alongside the UEFA President Michel Platini over an alleged 13m disloyal payment to the Frenchman Both men face possible life bans when their case is heard by the FIFA ethics committee in December if they are found guilty of the charges Among those also charged on Thursday were Rafael Salguero a Guatemalan who left the executive committee in May the former South American Confederation Secretary General Eduardo Deluca Perus former football federation president Manuel Burga and Bolivias football president Carlos Chaves already jailed in his own country Lynch said The Department of Justice is committed to ending the rampant corruption we have described amidst the leadership of international football not only because of the scale of the schemes alleged earlier and today or the breadth of the operation required to sustain such corruption but also because of the affront to international principles that this behaviour represents The acting FIFA President Issa Hayatou refused to comment on the detail of the latest arrests But he maintained neither he nor the organization was corrupt Appearing for the first time before the media since taking the role in September 2015 when Blatter was suspended Hayatou responded in a similar way to his predecessors in improbably claiming the current crisis was down to a handful of errant individuals FIFA is not corrupt We have individuals that have shown negative behaviour Do not generalize the situation said Hayatou

19,Serial dater Emmanuel Limal was tired of meeting women who werent ready to start a family or at least wouldnt admit that they were The 43yearold actor originally from France had spent 20 years living in Copenhagen and looking for love in the hope of raising children He recently took his quest online but was dismayed by the results I got frustrated with everyone trying to sell themselves as really active always travelling or with a long list of hobbies but no mention of children Limal said On some sites there was an option to click saying Id like kids someday but you would read the persons profile and think You will never have time If someones going to the gym eight times a week and travelling every month they are not putting a family first Limal has a sixyearold daughter from a previous relationship but coming from a big family his father is one of 11 he has always wanted more children I couldnt seem to meet anyone willing to prioritize starting a family and struggled with when to mention wanting kids any time I met someone new Its the ultimate dating taboo he said Then one day I read a profile from a 38yearold who said she knew it was really bad to admit but she wanted children And I just thought You shouldnt be ashamed of this Limal remortgaged his apartment to fund the setting up of Babyklarnu or babyready now in English It functions like a normal dating site but every potential dater is asked to be honest about their wish to start a family soon We ask people if they are OK with someone who already has children as well as wanting another baby Limal said But we dont make them specify how many children theyd like That would be a bit too much like grocery shopping online The response to the site has been overwhelming he said We had 50 signups an hour when we launched in June and we are already hearing from couples who have met through the site and are now together Im fully expecting the first Babyklarnu baby by next summer More men have signed up than women 53 to 47 with testimonials such as Its so lovely to be able to say this out loud and I finally dare to be honest about what I want The site has come at an opportune time for the country of five million people Danes are not having enough babies according to a report from the Copenhagen hospital Rigshospitalet and the current rate of 17 children per family is not enough to maintain Denmarks population The usual suspects are being blamed for the new low women leaving it too late and couples cohabiting and waiting to start families Now I hope men and women who want to start a family but havent met the right person yet will have another option says Limal Hes keen to point out that this isnt just about baby farming I want this to be about children and love My goal is to pair up people who really want a family and a partner and wholl stay together Im a romantic at heart There are plans to roll out the site in France and the UK later in 2013 but for now it is the Danes who are reaping the benefits Danes have no problem having children before marriage so things can move fast and because the countrys so small a Jutlander can date a Copenhagener without too much travel Limal said Whats more Limal has finally found love Ive met a nice woman and she wants a baby too so we shall see,Emmanuel Limal used online dating sites a lot but he was tired of meeting women who werent ready to start a family or at least wouldnt admit that they were The 43yearold actor originally from France had spent 20 years living in Copenhagen and looking for love in the hope of raising children He tried to find someone online but was dismayed by the results I got frustrated with everyone saying they were really active always travelling or with a long list of hobbies but no mention of children Limal said On some sites there was an option to click saying Id like kids someday but you would read the persons profile and think You will never have time If someones going to the gym eight times a week and travelling every month they are not putting a family first Limal has a sixyearold daughter from a previous relationship but coming from a big family his father is one of 11 he has always wanted more children I couldnt seem to meet anyone willing to prioritize starting a family He said it was difficult to know when to mention wanting kids when he met someone new Its the ultimate dating taboo he said Then one day I read a profile from a 38yearold who said she knew it was really bad to admit but she wanted children And I just thought You shouldnt be ashamed of this Limal borrowed money to pay for the setting up of Babyklarnu or babyready now in English It works like a normal dating site but everyone is asked to be honest about their wish to start a family soon We ask people if they are OK with someone who already has children and if they want another baby Limal said But we dont make them say how many children theyd like That would be a bit too much like grocery shopping online He has had a very positive response to the site We had 50 signups an hour when we started in June and we are already hearing from couples who have met through the site and are now together Im fully expecting the first Babyklarnu baby by next summer More men have signed up than women 53 to 47 with comments such as Its so lovely to be able to say this out loud and I finally dare to be honest about what I want The site has come at the right time for the country of five million people Danes are not having enough babies according to a report from the Copenhagen hospital Rigshospitalet and the current rate of 17 children per family is not enough to maintain Denmarks population The usual reasons are given women are leaving it too late and couples are living together without getting married and waiting to start families Now I hope men and women who want to start a family but havent met the right person yet will have another option says Limal He says that this isnt just about baby farming I want this to be about children and love My goal is to pair up people who really want a family and a partner and wholl stay together Im a romantic at heart There are plans to launch the site in France and the UK later in 2013 but for now it is the Danes who are benefitting from it Danes have no problem having children before marriage so things can move fast and because the countrys so small a Jutlander can date a Copenhagener without too much travel Limal said Whats more Limal has finally found love Ive met a nice woman and she wants a baby too so we shall

111,In homes and cafes across the country a cup of tea baked beans on toast and fish and chips have long played a key role in the British dining experience But the extent of a change in tastes over the generations has been captured in a dataset published recently in the National Food Survey which was set up in 1940 by the government after concerns about health and access to food Despite the apparent British love of tea consumption has more than halved since the 1970s falling from 68g of tea per person per week to only 25g With a teabag or portion of loose tea weighing around 3g that means Britons are drinking on average only eight cups of tea a week today down from 23 cups in 1974 And while tea remains the most drunk hot drink in the UK households now spend more on coffee The data published by the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs as part of its open data scheme is from 150000 households who took part in the survey between 1974 and 2000 combined with information from 2000 to 2014 It shows some moves towards healthier diets in recent decades with shifts to lowcalorie soft drinks from whole to skimmed milk and increasing consumption of fresh fruit But weekly consumption of chips pizza crisps and ready meals has soared There has also been a dramatic shift from white to brown wholemeal and other bread but the figures suggest the amount people are eating has fallen from 25 to 15 slices a week over the past four decades based on a 40g slice from a medium sliced loaf The consumption of baked beans in sauce has dropped by a fifth despite a rise in other types of convenience food particularly Italian dishes Adults in the UK now eat an average of 75g of pizza every week compared with none in 1974 while the consumption of pasta has almost tripled over the same period Fresh potatoes are also becoming less essential with a 67 decrease from 1974 when adults ate the equivalent of 188g every day Other vegetables such as cucumbers courgettes aubergines and mushrooms have gained space on the table Consumption of takeaway food has almost doubled since 1974 from 80g per person per week to 150g Around 33g of this amount is chips and 56g is meat with kebabs 10g chicken 7g burgers 5g and meatbased meals 32g particularly popular Some trends suggest that British people are becoming more prudent in what they put on their plates with the average consumption of fruit both fresh and processed increasing by 50 since 1974 In 2014 UK adults ate an average of 157g of fruit per day equivalent to almost two portions of the fiveaday recommendation from the government Bananas have been the most popular fruit in the UK since 1996 reaching 221g per adult per week in 2014 well above apples 131g and oranges 48g Lowcalorie soft drinks represented half of all soft drinks consumed in 2014 for the first time Other social changes emerge from the survey with questions about owning chickens and getting your own eggs being dropped in 1991 and a somewhat belated end in the same year to asking the housewife to fill out the questionnaire Britons are spending a smaller proportion of pay on food today 11 compared with 24 in 1974 The UK

138,Our new international survey across 33 countries shows just how wrong the world is about a range of key social realities British people think the top 1 wealthiest households own 59 of their countrys wealth when they actually only own 23 Americans think that 33 of their population are immigrants when in fact it is only 14 Brazilians think the average age in their country is 56 when it is only 31 Russians think that 31 of their politicians are women when it is only 14 In Britain people think that an extraordinary 43 of young adults aged 2534 still live at home with their parents rather than the actual 14 In India the online population think 60 of the whole country also has internet access when in fact only 19 do Why are people across the world so often so clueless about these realities It is partly that we just struggle with basic maths and some of us clearly misunderstand the questions or interpret them differently For example most countries hugely overestimate how many people do not af liate themselves with a religion across the 33 countries 37 do not according to respondents but the average is actually just 18 This will be partly because we will be thinking of how many people practise their religion rather than what they put on census forms People also take mental shortcuts where they grab for easily available information even if it doesnt quite t the question Our huge overestimates of the rural populations in most countries will be affected by how much of the physical landmass rural areas make up rather than a careful calculation of how unoccupied it generally is In Daniel Kahnemans terms answers to these sorts of questions are classic examples of fast thinking rather than slow We are tied to our own perspective and struggle to imagine the variety in our countries as highlighted by our Indian samples massively overestimating their populations access to the internet Our study was mostly carried out through an online survey and in developing countries this will be representative of a more af uent connected group rather than the population as a whole In some ways we may have expected this more educated sample to get closer to reality those with higher education levels tend to be more accurate on these types of questions But what we nd throughout the study is that people grossly generalize from their own situations forgetting how unrepresentative they are We suffer from what social psychologists call emotional innumeracy when estimating realities this means we are sending a message about what is worrying us as much as trying to get the right answers Cause and effect run both ways with our concern leading to our misperceptions as much as our misperceptions creating our concern For Britain this is likely to be part of the explanation for peoples huge overestimates of how much the wealthiest own how many young people are still living at home and what proportion of the population are immigrants the guess is 25 when it is really only 13 according to of cial estimates People are worried about the concentration of wealth the housing pressures facing young people and immigration levels and this is re ected in them overstating the scale of the issues But the survey suggests there are also some issues where people are not as worried as they should be For example most countries hugely underestimate how much of their population is overweight or obese The worst case is Saudi Arabia where people think only 28 are when 71 are Britons think it is 44 when it is actually nearly half as much again 62 are either overweight or obese And in many ways it is not our misperceptions but these realities across different countries that are the most interesting and important aspects of the study The top 1 in Russia own 70 of the nations wealth while the top 1 in New Zealand only own 18 Half of Italians aged 2534 still live with their parents when it is only 4 in Norway The average age in India is 27 it is 47 in

141,Although much of his work and arguably nearly all the best of it was rmly within the discipline of the blues BB King was always openminded and interested when he found himself in other settings bridging musical and cultural differences with affability and skill Perhaps it is premature to speak of the last of the bluesmen but it is hard to imagine any future blues artist matching Kings in uence over musicians by the thousand and audiences by the million in a career spanning 65 years Riley B King the B did not seem to stand for a name was born near Itta Bena Mississippi and grew up with the limited prospects of an AfricanAmerican agricultural worker a barrier he gradually worked to overcome as he learnt the basics of guitar from a family friend and honed his singing with a quartet of gospel singers In his early 20s he moved to Memphis Within a couple of years he was playing regularly at a bar in West Memphis Arkansas He also became a disc jockey presenting a show on a Memphis radio station His billing The Beale Street Blues Boy was shortened to Blues Boy King and thence to BB After a single session in 1949 for a Nashville label King began recording for the West Coastbased Modern Records in 1950 He had his rst hit in 1952 with a dramatic rearrangement of Three OClock Blues which topped the RB chart for 15 weeks it was the rst of a list of successes such as Please Love Me You Upset Me Baby and Sweet Sixteen On these and his dozens of other recordings most of them his own compositions King developed a style that was both innovative and rooted in blues history He was always ready to praise the musicians who had in uenced him and would usually mention TBone Walker first Ive tried my best to get that sound he told the Guitar Player magazine I came pretty close but never quite got it In an interview in 2001 he said If TBone Walker had been a woman I would have asked him to marry me But he would also cite the earlier blues guitarists Blind Lemon Jefferson and Lonnie Johnson and the jazz players Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt He once explained that his guitar technique was partly based on his lack of skill I started to bend notes because I could never play in the bottleneck style like Elmore James and Booker White I loved that sound but just couldnt do it He was similarly selfdeprecating about his singing a sumptuous blend of honey and lemon mixed halfandhalf from crooners such as Nat King Cole and blues shouters such as Joe Turner and Dr Clayton Probably his favourite composer and singer was Louis Jordan whose music he commemorated in the 1999 album Let the Good Times Roll Throughout the 1950s King was the leading blues artist on the circuit of blackpatronized theatres and clubs on an interminable series of onenighters In 1956 he is supposed to have lled 342 engagements In 1962 he tried to change that working pattern by signing with a major label ABC but the rst records under that contract which tried to reshape him as a mainstream pop singer were as unsatisfactory to his admirers as they were to ABCs accountants The 1965 album Live at the Regal however proved the durability of Kings blues repertoire and has become iconic a turning point in the early listening of many younger musicians He had further RB hits with blues numbers including How Blue Can You Get and Paying the Cost to Be the Boss and in 1969 he hit the upper reaches of the pop charts where no blues artist had been for many years with The Thrill Is Gone It took him a while to establish himself with a rock audience for whom the blues was largely de ned by the Chicago school of Muddy Waters and Howlin Wolf but he was brought to their attention by musicians who admired him About a year and a half ago he said in 1969 all of a sudden kids started coming up to me saying Youre the greatest blues guitarist in the world And Id say Who told you that And theyd say Mike Bloom eld or Eric Clapton Its to these youngsters that I owe my new popularity He acquired further rock credibility with the 1970 album Indianola Mississippi Seeds on which he collaborated with Carole King and Joe Walsh From then on King was rmly established as the chairman of the board of blues singers Guided by his manager Sidney Seidenberg he embarked on international concert tours that took him to Japan Australia China and Russia He also gave concerts to prisoners at the Cook County jail in Chicago and at San Quentin experiences that led to his long involvement in rehabilitation programmes In 1990 King was diagnosed with diabetes and cut back his touring but not so much that his followers outside the US could not catch up with him every year or two Though he would now deliver most of his act seated the strength of his singing and the uency of his playing were only very gradually diminished The celebrations for his 80th birthday in 2005 included an awardwinning album of collaborations with Clapton Mark Knop er Roger Daltrey Gloria Estefan and others tributes from musicians as diverse as Bono Amadou Bagayoko and Elton John and a farewell tour that proved not to be a farewell at all In 2009 King received a Grammy award for best traditional blues album for One Kind Favor In 2012 he performed at a concert at the White House where the US President Barack Obama joined him to sing Sweet Home Chicago King was twice married and twice divorced He is survived by 11 children by various partners four others predeceased him,Much of BB Kings best work was blues but he was always openminded about and interested in other kinds of music He bridged musical and cultural differences with warmth and skill Perhaps it is too early to speak of the last of the bluesmen but it is hard to imagine that any future blues artist will match King He in uenced

names of children born in Iceland must unless both parents are foreign be submitted to the National Registry within six months of birth If they are not on a recognized list of 1853 female and 1712

applications and rejects about half under a 1996 act aimed mainly at preserving the language of the sagas Among its requirements are that given names must be capable of having Icelandic grammatical endings may not conflict with the linguistic structure of Iceland and should be written in accordance with the ordinary rules of Icelandic orthography What this means in practice is that names containing letters that do not officially exist in Icelands 32letter alphabet such as c are out Similarly names unable to accommodate the endings required by the nominative accusative genitive and

13,A nasal spray laced with the Love hormone oxytocin could help children with autism learn to handle social situations better US researchers claim Scans of children with autistic spectrum disorder showed that a single dose of the chemical improved brain responses to facial expressions a shift that could make social interactions feel more natural and rewarding for them The scientists behind the research said a course of oxytocin might boost the success of behavioural therapies that are already used to help people with autism learn to cope with social situations Over time what you would expect to see is more appropriate social responding being more interested in interacting with other people more eye contact and more conversational ability said Kevin Pelphrey director of the Child Neuroscience Lab at Yale University Autism is a developmental disorder seen in more than one in 100 people The condition affects individuals in different ways but is characterized by difficulties in social interaction and communication So far there is no established treatment for the social problems caused by autism Researchers at Yale have studied the brain chemical oxytocin as a potential treatment for the social impairments caused by autism because it plays a crucial role in bonding and trust Results have been mixed though one recent study found no significant benefit for youths given the chemical over several days But Pelphrey said oxytocin might help the brain learn from social interactions it would work best when used with therapies that encourage people with autism to engage more socially he said Our study shows that oxytocin affects the brain and opens up the possibility that when combined with behavioural treatments it works like a social enhancer he said The scientists used a technique called functional MRI to scan the brains of 17 youths aged eight to 16 with autism while they looked at images of cars or the eyes of people expressing various emotions The scans were given 45 minutes after the participants inhaled a placebo or oxytocin through a nasal spray The scans showed that reward circuitry in the childrens brains behaved more normally after a snort of oxytocin being more active when the person was looking at faces and less active when viewing the inanimate cars The study appears in the latest issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in the United States If this is replicated it suggests that oxytocin might treat something for which we dont have a treatment in autism and thats the core social motivation Pelphrey told the Guardian He warned that it was too early to use oxytocin as a treatment for the social difficulties caused by autism and cautioned against buying oxytocin from suppliers online We dont want them running out on the basis of this study or any other and trying oxytocin at home There is no telling what they are buying We are nowhere near thinking this is a ready treatment It needs more followup he said This is an important new study in identifying changes in brain activity in key regions of the brain involved in social cognition in autism following oxytocin administration said Simon BaronCohen director of the Autism Research Centre at Cambridge University A surprising finding however is that oxytocin nasal spray did not change performance on the social cognitive task Nor is it clear yet if oxytocin only has benefits for people with autism or has any unwanted side effects Finally oxytocin effects only last about 45 minutes so there may be practical considerations as to whether this could be used as a treatment From a scientific perspective this study has a lot of evidence from animal and human work to justify serious attention but more research is needed Doctors should be cautious about the clinical potential of this hormone until we know much more about its benefits and risks in much larger studies Said Simon BaronCohen Uta Frith who studies autism at University College London said According to this study oxytocin may have the effect of making faces more interesting as assessed by greater activity in brain structures concerned with reward evaluation Disappointingly this effect is seen only in brain activity and not in behaviour Demonstrating an effect on behaviour will be critical if nasal spray treatment is to be of any value,According to American researchers a nasal spray containing the Love hormone oxytocin could help children with autism behave more normally in social situations Scans of autistic children showed that a single dose of the chemical improved brain responses to facial expressions This is something that could make social interactions feel more natural and rewarding for them The researchers said oxytocin might increase the success of behavioural therapies that are already used to help people with autism learn to cope with social situations Over time what you would expect to see is more normal social responding being more interested in interacting with other people more eye contact and more conversation said Kevin Pelphrey of Yale University Autism is a developmental disorder that more than one in 100 people have The condition affects people in different ways but leads to difficulties in social interaction and communication So far there is no established treatment for the social problems caused by autism Researchers at Yale have studied the brain chemical oxytocin as a possible treatment for the social problems caused by autism because it plays an important role in bonding and trust Results have been mixed though one recent study found no significant benefit for young people given the chemical over several days But Pelphrey said oxytocin might help the brain learn from social interactions it would work best when used with therapies that encourage people with autism to interact more socially he said The scientists scanned the brains of 17 young people aged eight to 16 with autism while they looked at images of cars or the eyes of people expressing different emotions The scans were given 45 minutes after the young people inhaled a placebo or oxytocin through a nasal spray The scans showed that the reward circuits in the childrens brains behaved more normally after a dose of oxytocin that is they were more active when the person was looking at faces and less active when looking at the inanimate cars The study appears in the latest issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in the United States The study suggests that oxytocin might treat something for which we dont have a treatment in autism and thats the core social motivation said Pelphrey He warned that it was too early to use oxytocin as a treatment for the social difficulties caused by autism and said people should not buy oxytocin online We dont want them trying oxytocin at home Its impossible to say what they are buying We are nowhere near thinking this is a ready treatment It needs more followup he said This is an important new study in identifying changes in brain activity in key areas of the brain said Simon BaronCohen director of the Autism Research

58,Back in 2010 the old city in Srinagar was the sort of place police would only venture into wearing body armour A stronghold for violent separatists agitating for an independent Kashmir it was at the centre of uprisings that left more than 100 people dead buried along with dreams of peace in the mountainous northIndian region How quickly things change Now carefree tourists line up in the same streets for barbecued mutton tikka and steaming plates of rogan josh The Nowhatta mosque where in the summer of 2010 youths would gather after Friday prayers to throw stones at the security forces is to become part of an official walking tour focused on heritage crafts and markets Down by Dal Lake houseboats have been booked out months in advance In the stunning gardens lining the lakes green slopes visitors can have their picture taken against one of Asias prettiest backdrops Until the snow melted the nearby ski resorts were packed with rich Russians too In 2002 only just over 27000 tourists dared to visit the Kashmir Valley frightened off by the antiIndian insurgency which has claimed up to 70000 lives So far in 2012 the area has received almost one million holidaymakers more than 23000 of them from outside India But fewer than 150 Britons were among them largely because the UKs Foreign Office refuses to amend its somewhat hairraising advice which deters most travellers by providing a list of recent security incidents in the region Omar Abdullah the UKborn Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir has lobbied the British High Commission in Delhi to relax the guidelines but to no avail Its a source of frustration admitted Abdullah who has been in charge of Indias most sensitive state since the start of 2009 Today unfortunately as a result of that travel advisory peoples insurance is null and void when they visit here The last publicized case of foreign tourists being murdered in JK was in 1995 when six westerners including two Britons were kidnapped by AlFaran a Kashmiri militant Islamist group Only one escaped with his life Youve had British citizens killed more recently in countries that you still havent stopped people from visiting I mean how many British citizens did you lose in 911 Did you stop people from visiting New York Youve lost them in Spain in Bali tell me where you havent lost them said Abdullah Weve lost Indians in London There is still a possibility that alQaida could do something stupid like they have done in the past but we havent stopped Indians from travelling to London There is no reason to single out Jammu and Kashmir or even Srinagar as an unsafe destination Germany relaxed its guidelines for those thinking of travelling to the region in 2011 Foreigners are generally not direct targets of clashes counselled Germanys amended advice At the time it was viewed by many outsiders as a bold move coming less than a year after the 2010 disturbances finally died down A nationwide holiday on 15 August marked 65 years of Indian independence in the past a day fraught with peril in a state where many do not feel part of the worlds biggest democracy But this time at the independence celebrations there was no trouble Abdullah insists tourists are safe in the state as long as you take the sort of precautions that one normally would In other words do not go trekking near the border that separates the Indian and Pakistani controlled parts of JK Syed Ali Shah Geelani leader of the proKashmiri independence party disagrees bitterly with much of Abdullahs politics But on the issue of tourism the two are united At the start of the summer season Geelani wrote an open letter to tourists and pilgrims that said Whatever your faith whatever language you speak and to whatever region you belong we are bound by a common bond the bond of humanity You are our honoured guest respecting and protecting guests is not only our moral obligation but an article of faith Some visitors may worry about the ethics of having fun in a place with a population suffering from record levels of anxiety and mental health problems But all the locals we spoke to in Srinagar were wholeheartedly in favour of tourism Amjid Gulzar 26 said Abdullah could search for truth and reconciliation as well as encouraging foreign visitors He must do both but without tourism our economy will be in chaos he said adding that while he welcomed the million tourists who visited this year Kashmir had to do more to attract bigspending visitors especially foreigners We need better infrastructure better roads reliable electricity We need more for tourists to do in the evening we dont even have one cinema in this city and there isnt enough for tourists to do after dark he said But will tourists feel welcome In June a local Islamic group issued a dress code for foreign tourists Abdullah sighs at the mention of that furore Nobody expects tourists to come here and cover their faces I think what they were talking about was short shorts and sleeveless vests which even then would not be something that would attract too much attention I think the basic point they were making was be sensitive to our cultural identity and dress appropriately I think thats common sense Abdullah said he was on a tourism drive for no other reason than the fact that I need to stimulate the economy JKs finances are in a dire state after more than two decades of turmoil The state receives just 72m each year in taxes and yet the salary bill for the 500000 public employees is 155m he said It is clear why he needs to find more funds fast For now though he is just cautiously pleased to see tourists back Im not suggesting that because weve had one million tourists here that its a sign of normality he said But it gives me some satisfaction that people can come have a nice time and go back,In 2010 the police would only enter the old city in Srinagar wearing body armour It was at the centre of uprisings by violent separatists who were fighting for an

Gallagher but said the pair had forged a brothersisterlike relationship Axani had made headlines in 2014 after offering an air ticket to any Canadian named Elizabeth Gallagher He had booked a threeweek vacation with his exgirlfriend but after they split up he was unable to change the name on the flights Thats where Axanis new travelmate a 23yearold student from Cole Harbour Nova Scotia came in Gallagher who goes by the name Quinn replied to a Reddit post Axani had submitted along with other hopeful Elizabeth Gallaghers and was selected Gallagher had made it clear before the trip that she had a pretty serious boyfriend but that had not stopped romantics and journalists from hoping the globetrotters might fall for one another Unfortunately it was not to be Im going to be explicitly clear Axani said shortly after the pair returned to Toronto This was never a romantic endeavour It was strictly platonic I do not think of Quinn in a romantic light in the least There is no future for us romantically She is a good friend I think of her as a little sister but that will be it And her feelings are entirely mutual in that regard It took work to establish that brothersister goodfriend nofutureforusromantically relationship however It wasnt easy and it certainly wasnt immediate It took us about a week to really figure each other out Axani said There was a certain amount

102,Bogus allergy tests are convincing thousands of people to take unnecessary treatments and put themselves or their children on inadequate diets sometimes resulting in malnutrition a group of experts and charities has said Allergies and food intolerances are soaring but confusion between the two as well as the many misdiagnoses are causing real harm said the information organization Sense About Science which has produced a guide in collaboration with allergy specialists and charities Its probably the biggest mess for science communication where myths misinterpreted studies and quackery collide with under and overdiagnosis said Tracey Brown director of Sense About Science The costs are huge unnecessary actions for some and not enough action for those whose lives depend on it Experts fear that restaurants and caterers are seeing so many people claiming they have allergies which can be dangerous for the individual when in fact they have a food intolerance which is not that they may not take all the precautions they should when serving a person who has a genuine allergy It matters very much said Moira Austin of the Anaphylaxis Campaign If a caterer thinks somebody is just avoiding a food because they dont want to get bloated they may be less careful There have been a number of fatalities where people have gone to a restaurant and alerted staff that they have an allergy to a particular food and the meal has been served up containing that allergen The guide says most internet and shopbought allergy tests have no scientific basis They include a hometesting kit that looks for specific IgG immunoglobulin G antibodies against food stuffs in the blood While these antibodies are part of the immune systems response to infections the best medical evidence has shown elevated IgG levels do not suggest an allergy the guide says Results are frequently positive in individuals who do not have an allergy or a food intolerance Also debunked is a test a mixture of acupuncture and homeopathy which attempts to measure electronic resistance across the skin while the child or adult holds the suspect food in their hand Hair follicle testing is also pointless the guide says Hair is not involved in allergic reactions so testing hair samples cannot provide any useful information on allergic status Nor should people be deceived into thinking allergies are caused by an energy blockage that can be diagnosed by muscle testing and cured by acupuncture I commonly see children whove been put on to unnecessarily restricted diets because their parents assume in good faith that they have allergies to multiple foods on the basis of allergy tests that have no scientific basis said Paul Seddon a consultant paediatric allergist on behalf of the UK Cochrane Centre an independent organization that assesses medical evidence This needs to stop which can only happen if we debunk these tests Another consultant paediatric allergist Adam Fox from Guys and St Thomas Hospital in London said I get a number of patients and my colleagues likewise who will come in having sent their hair off for analysis or having excluded a whole range of foods for their children It is very difficult to untangle that There are two challenges Children need to be given proper diets but more of it is the unnecessary avoidance of things that arent harmful which has a huge impact on the quality of life A child who cant eat wheat or drink milk cant go to parties The conviction that a childs chronic lethargy or headaches or eczema are caused by an allergy takes a long time and many tests to prove or disprove It is tempting to go to an alternative therapist who will do a single test and provide a quick but inaccurate answer Allergies are on the rise across developed countries The percentages of children diagnosed with allergic rhinitis and eczema have both trebled in the last 30 years While there is now better diagnosis the rise in incidence is real leading many more people to suspect allergies are the reason for their own or their childrens health issues The guide lists a number of myths about the sources of allergies from the suggestion that they are caused by E numbers in food colourings to toxic overload and fast food,According to a group of experts bogus allergy tests are convincing thousands of people to take unnecessary treatments and put themselves or their

163,Clay Cockrell is sitting in his of ce at Columbus Circle across the street from 1 Central Park West which houses Trump International Hotel and Tower In front of the tower is Central Park where Cockrell holds his popular walk and talk therapy sessions Cockrell a former Wall Street worker turned therapist spends large parts of his days walking through Central Park or the Battery Park in downtown Manhattan near Wall Street as a con dant and counsellor to some of New Yorks wealthiest people I shifted towards it naturally he said of his becoming an expert in wealth therapy Many of the extremely wealthy the 1 of the 1 feel that their problems are really not problems But they are A lot of therapists do not give enough weight to their issues So what issues are Americas 1 struggling with There is guilt over being rich in the rst place he said There is the feeling that they have to hide the fact that they are rich And then there is the isolation being in the 1 it turns out can be lonely It seems F Scott Fitzgerald was right the very rich are different from you and me Counsellors argue things have become worse since the nancial crisis and the debate over income inequality that has been spurred on by movements like Occupy Wall Street and the Fight for 15 fair wage campaign The Occupy Wall Street movement was a good one and had some important things to say about income inequality but it singled out the 1 and painted them globally as something negative said Jamie TraegerMuney a wealth psychologist and founder of the Wealth Legacy Group The media she said is partly to blame for making the rich feel like they need to hide or feel ashamed TraegerMuney runs a global rm and specializes in working with inheritors who often get a bad reputation in the press You can come up with lots of words and sayings about inheritors not one of them is positive spoilt brat born with a silver spoon in their mouth trustfund babies all these things she said adding that its easy to scapegoat the rich Sometimes I am shocked by things that people say You would never refer to another group of people in the way that it seems perfectly normal to refer to wealth holders Its really isolating to have a lot of money Peoples reactions to you can be scary said Barbara Nusbaum an expert in money psychology We are all taught not to talk about money Its not polite to talk about money Ironically its harder to talk about having money than it is to talk about not having money Its much more socially acceptable to say I am broke Things are hard You cant say I have a ton of money You have to keep a lot of your life private As a result Cockrell points out the rich tend to hang out with other rich Americans not out of snobbery but in order to be around those who understand them and their problems The growing gap between the rich and poor is a global phenomenon According to Oxfam the richest 1 have seen their share of global wealth increase from 44 in 2009 to 48 in 2014 and are on track to own more than the other 99 by 2016 In the US over the last three decades the wealth owned by the top 01 households increased from 7 to 22 even as the wealth of the bottom 90 of households declined The number of extremely wealthy people has also been climbing According to research from Spectrem Group in 2014 the number of US households with 1m or more in assets excluding the value of their primary home increased by 500000 to 101m In 2007 that number was 92m Households worth 5m or more reached 13m and 142000 households are now worth 25m or more Since the 2008 nancial crisis the income gap has expanded and the situation has gotten worse for the wealthy Cockrell said The main reason Not knowing if your friends are friends with you or your money Someone else who is also a billionaire they dont want anything from you Never being able to trust your friendships with people of different means I think that is dif cult said Cockrell As the gap has widened the rich have become more and more isolated These are real fears faced by the richest of the rich In 2007 the Gates Foundation teamed up with Boston Colleges Center on Wealth and Philanthropy to document what it felt like to be in Americas 1 For the next four years researchers surveyed 165 of Americas richest households 120 of those households have at least 25m in assets The average net worth of those surveyed was 78m The resulting study The Joys and Dilemmas of Wealth was 500 pages long and seemed to prove the old adage that money cant buy happiness Wealth can be a barrier to connecting with other people confessed a spouse of a tech entrepreneur who made about 80m Some Americans have taken to keeping their wealth secret We talk about it as stealth wealth There are a lot of people that are hiding their wealth because they are concerned about negative judgment said TraegerMuney If wealthy Americans talk about the unique challenges that come with their wealth people often dismiss their experience People say Oh poor you There is not a lot of sympathy there she said Wealth is still one of our last taboos Speaking in his soft soothing voice that makes you want to spill all your worries Cockrell said that a common mistake that many of his wealthy clients make is letting their money de ne them I dont think its healthy to discount your problems If you are part of the 1 you still have problems and they are legitimate to you Even when you say I dont have to struggle for money there are other parts of your life Money is not the only thing that de nes you he said Your problems are legitimate,Clay Cockrell is sitting in his of ce across the street from 1 Central Park West the address of the Trump International Hotel and Tower In front of the tower is Central Park where Cockrell holds his popular walk and talk therapy sessions Cockrell a former Wall Street worker who is now a therapist spends large parts of his days walking through Central Park or the Battery Park in downtown Manhattan near Wall Street as a con dant and counsellor to some of New Yorks wealthiest people Many of the extremely wealthy the 1 of the 1 feel that their problems are really not problems But they are he says So what issues do Americas 1 have There is guilt because they are rich he said There is the feeling that they have to hide the fact that they are rich And then there is the isolation being in the 1 can be lonely Counsellors argue that things have become worse since the nancial crisis and the discussion about income inequality brought on by movements like Occupy Wall Street The Occupy Wall Street movement was a good one and had some important things to say about income inequality but it singled out the 1 as something negative said Jamie TraegerMuney a wealth psychologist and founder of the Wealth Legacy Group The media she said is partly to blame for making the rich feel like they need to hide or feel ashamed TraegerMuney runs a global business and specializes in working with inheritors who often get a bad reputation in the press Sometimes I am shocked by things that people say You would never refer to another group of people in the way that it seems perfectly normal to refer to wealthy people Its really isolating to have a lot of money Peoples reactions to you can be scary said Barbara Nusbaum an expert in money psychology We are all taught not to talk about money Its not polite to talk about money But its harder to talk about having money than it is to talk about not having money Its much more socially acceptable to say I am broke Things are hard You cant say I have a ton of money You have to keep a lot of your life private As a result Cockrell says the rich usually hang out with other rich Americans who understand them and their problems In the US over the last three decades the number of extremely wealthy people has been increasing According to research from Spectrem Group in 2014 the number of US households with 1m or more excluding the value of their main home increased by 500000 to 101m Households worth 5m or more reached 13m and 142000 households are now worth 25m or more Since the 2008 nancial crisis the income gap has grown and

76,Glastonbury Festival is to combat the scourge of the plastic water bottle as part of a longterm strategy to become the worlds most environmentally friendly outdoor music event Festival organizers are targeting the disposable bottle one of the most conspicuous symbols of the throwaway culture that each year leaves the 900acre Somerset site wreathed in plastic with an estimated one million plastic bottles being used during the festival Stainlesssteel reusable bottles will be given to 2000 road crew and band members with thousands more on sale to festivalgoers to stop them relying on plastic bottles The 140000 ticketholders are also being urged to bring reusable bottles that they can fill at 400 drinkingwater taps dotted across the site Lucy Smith Glastonburys green issues organizer said We have amazing water quality in the UK but everyone is obsessed with drinking bottled water She said the initiative precedes a plan for Glastonbury 2015 to replace all plastic beer glasses and cutlery with reusable items in an attempt to eradicate the legacy of plastic waste from the huge rural site Environmentalists estimate that 150 million tonnes of plastic waste currently litters the planet and oceans poisoning ecosystems and killing wildlife Ultimately festival organizers hope to make Glastonbury the worlds greenest greenfield festival emulating Americas Burning Man festival in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada which is a leavenotrace event where people have to take away all that they bring Glastonbury revellers are also being urged to travel to the site on public transport or try carsharing with friends We want to be as sustainable as we can We do everything we can but coping with the litter of 140000 people is a challenge We cant put bins everywhere added Smith Campaigners say that plastic water bottles can take hundreds or even thousands of years to completely biodegrade with their manufacture exacerbating their negative ecological impact Millions of barrels of oil are used in the manufacture of plastic bottles and the transportation of mineral water across the planet produces even more carbon emissions Overall an estimated 13 billion plastic water bottles are sold in the UK every year yet just one in five is said to be recycled Smith said that instead of buying bottled water festivalgoers should take advantage of the water on tap which is being drawn from huge underground reservoirs instead of oldfashioned water tanks that provided heavily chlorinated drinking water The charity WaterAid will also set up water kiosks around the site stocking reusable bottles and cups and offering free refills In 2015 the kiosks modelled on those found in Africa will double as DJ booths at night Organizers say that almost half of all the rubbish left on site was recycled in 2013 and add that there will be 15000 bins for recycling across the festival grounds in 2014 Despite its growing ecocredentials critics continue to snipe at Glastonbury accusing it of becoming increasingly corporate in tone The latest critic Iron Maidens Bruce Dickinson has vowed never to bring his band to Glastonbury Festival after dismissing it as the most

questions have risen to the fore in an arcane but hugely important debate about how to redraw the boundaries of the internet Brazil and Peru have lodged objections to a bid made by the US ecommerce giant for a prime new piece of cyberspace amazon The Seattlebased company has applied for its brand to be a toplevel domain name currently com but the South American governments argue this would prevent the use of this internet address for environmental protection the promotion of indigenous rights and other public interest uses Along with dozens of other disputed claims to names including patagonia and shangrila the issue cuts to the heart of debates about the purpose and governance of the internet Until now the differences between commercial governmental and other types of identity

contentious application is for its own brand Brazil and Peru have called for the amazon application to be withdrawn saying a private company should not be assigned a name that denotes an important geographical area that spans their territories and is also used for certain regions and crossborder organizations Allowing private companies to register geographical names as gTLDs to reinforce their brand strategy or to profit from the meaning of these names does not serve in our view the public interest the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology said Brazil said its views were endorsed last month by other members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Bolivia Colombia Ecuador Guyana Suriname and Venezuela Dozens of other protests have also been registered over proposed toplevel domains that take geographical cultural or contested brand names Argentina has lodged an expression of its unhappiness that the US outdoor clothing retailer Patagonia is claiming a domain name that has been known far longer as a region of spectacular beauty that also has its own parliament Argentina rejects the patagonia request for a new generic toplevel domain the government notes in an appeal Patagonia is a relevant region for the countrys economy because it has oil fishing mining and agriculture resources It is also a region with a vibrant local community and it is a major tourist destination Less convincingly China has disputed the domain shangrila which is proposed by a hotel group of the same name The authorities in Beijing say the shangrila label belongs to a region in Yunnan province although it was only renamed as such in 2001 long after the hotel group was formed so that the local community could cash in on the fame of the fictional paradise depicted in the novel Lost Horizon by British author James Hilton At a conference in April in Beijing ICANNs Governmental Advisory Committee the primary voice of national governments within the institution recommended a freeze on disputed proposals They are expected to be discussed again at a meeting in Durban in July The first approved domain names should be in use before the end of 2013,When you see the word Amazon

87,A long time ago cinema audiences were transported to a galaxy far far away one where imperial cruisers battled rebel ghters where droids rubbed circuits with Wookiees and where a spaceship called the Millennium Falcon could make the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs That was 1977 but in 2015 as the franchise approaches its seventh bigscreen instalment interest in Star Wars shows no sign of abating now there is news of a new lm about Han Solo and of a reappearance for Darth Vader Countless fans around the world are in a constant state of vigilance waiting for the release of new poster art new trailers and other information said Paul Dergarabedian senior media analyst at boxof ce monitor Rentrak Its hard to imagine any other movie franchise that could evoke such a level of passion enthusiasm and excitement The latest Star Wars mania dates from the Hollywood studio Disneys purchase of Lucas lm from the lms creator George Lucas in 2012 the 4bn acquisition was accompanied by an announcement of three more sequential episodes VII VIII and IX plus then unspeci ed plans for spinoff movies and stand alones to ll the gaps in the release schedule Details of the second spinoff have now been made public an origins story about Han Solo the intergalactic smuggler played by Harrison Ford in the rst three lms which is scheduled to be released in May 2018 It will follow the release in December 2015 of Episode VII directed by JJ Abrams and titled Star Wars The Force Awakens the unnamed Episode VIII due out in 2017 and the already announced spinoff Rogue One which will arrive in cinemas in 2016 That movie will outline a rebel mission to steal the plans of the Death Star a key plot element of the rst lm in 1977 Levels of interest in the rumour that Rogue One will also feature the reappearance of Darth Vader the blackclad villain of the original series only con rmed the power of Star Wars nostalgia In creating a multistranded multicharacter cinema universe around Star Wars Lucas lmDisney are taking their cue from the phenomenally successful series of lms produced by Marvel Studios which Disney also acquired in 2009 Disney has brought a whole new level of marketing savvy to an already popular product Dergarabedian cites the decision to make all six existing Star Wars lms available on streaming services as a brilliant way to build the anticipation for the new lm and reinvigorate the idea of Star Wars in the minds of the fans Whether it needs reinvigorating is questionable The level of enthusiasm that has surrounded Star Wars for at least the last two decades is evidenced by what has become known as the Expanded Universe the plethora of novels comic books video games and merchandising that Lucas lm has created or licensed over This extra material began emerging as far back as 1978 but was given a massive kick by the mushrooming of the internet in the 1990s Roleplay and fan participation show no sign of slowing in the UK eventcinema brand Secret Cinema have found considerable commercial success with their live staging of The Empire Strikes Back Michael Rosser news editor for Screen International suggests that it is this shared universe of highly infectious nostalgia that keeps Star Wars in pole position among lm franchises The great thing about the original lms was that they created a huge universe of characters and possibility that sparked the imagination of viewers he said For years people have been wondering how the different strands would play out This new lm because its going back to Han Solo and Luke Skywalker looks as though it will reconnect with the original Star Wars in a way that the prequels failed to Rosser is referring to the three lms Lucas directed between 1999 and 2005 The Phantom Menace Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith which chronicled the life of Luke Skywalkers father Anakin who transforms into Darth Vader Despite being greeted with lessthanstellar reviews the prequels took 25bn at the worldwide box of ce shortly after the release of restored and augmented special editions of the rst trilogy had netted 469m in 1997 It shows the power of Star Wars that although they were disappointing the prequels still managed to make a lot of money said Rosser In a lm business where branding is all and a successful franchise the answer to everybodys prayers is there a risk that movie studios will simply become branding machines and lose their interest in cinema for its own sake Rosser thinks not They are desperate to ensure the longevity of the franchise and make sure the quality is kept up They are also trying to bring people into the cinema at a time when lots are staying home for entertainment But you dont want to watch Star Wars on your iPhone so I dont think its going to run out of steam any time soon Meanwhile Dergarabedian is anticipating massive business when The Force Awakens reaches cinemas in December 2015 We are certainly looking at a record opening for December and it should go on to make at least a billion dollars worldwide Truly Star Wars is the ultimate movie brand,A long time ago cinema audiences were transported to a galaxy far far away

95,Agios Efstratios is so remote so forgotten by the banks the government and most of the modern world that the mobile phone network cant process data and there isnt a single ATM or creditcard machine on the island Before Greece was plunged into nancial chaos residents of this tranquil outpost in the northern Aegean managed quite well They did their banking at the post of ce and the few dozen rooms to rent were booked out every summer with people who had heard by word of mouth of its spectacular empty beaches clear seas and fresh seafood But because the island still runs on cash the closure of banks nationwide has been devastating Residents have been forced to make ninehour round trips to the nearest big island to get cash and Greek visitors say they cant get together enough money to come Tourist numbers are down 80 this year said Mayor Maria Kakali in an of ce in the village where she grew up home to around 200 people Even people born here and living in Athens who have their own places on the island arent coming Kakali has badgered the government and a major Greek bank into promising an ATM within weeks but she still feels it may come too late for this season on an island where tourism dwarfs the two other sources of income shing and agriculture We have almost no reservations in August when usually we have people calling us up asking to nd a room and we cant help them A hard winter ahead may be slightly improved by 50 workers billeted in the village to expand the harbour but there is an even bigger crisis looming because the government has said it will end a decadesold tax break for islands Created to help island communities survive when they were suffering mass emigration a lower sales tax contained the costs of living in places where everything had to be imported and made tourism more affordable Tourist favourites such as Mykonos fear that losing the tax breaks will make it hard for them to compete with Turkey but for Agios Efstratios it poses a far greater threat If we have to pay a tax of 23 Im sorry to say it but we will all die on the island says Kakali Food and fuel are already more expensive than on the mainland there are no economies of scale and little economic exibility on an island which even in summer has only three shops two restaurants and not a single of cial hotel This is an expensive island Everything even milk or bread has changed hands three or four times before it gets to us and each middleman has to take a pro t said Provatas Costas a 58yearold sherman For Agios Efstratios and its closest large neighbour Lemnos the timing of the crisis is particularly cruel They were condemned to relative obscurity for years in part because they are served by slow and unreliable ferries In 2015 the government had nally given the contract to a new ef cient company drawing oods of new visitors to explore the islands largely overlooked charms before the bank controls hit It started out as the best season in 30 years and in one week became the worst said Atzamis Konstantinos a travel agent in Lemnos who used to earn 15000 a month as a captain of petroleum tankers and other large ships but came home because he missed it so much I always loved this island even when I was young I would dock in Piraeus the port in Athens take my pay then get the rst boat over People would say Youre crazy You can go anywhere but I only ever wanted to come here Lemnos has dozens of wild beaches where even at the height of summer you can swim and sunbathe virtually alone a small nightlife scene and numerous cultural sites It is the eighth largest island in Greece so is in line for the rst round of tax increases in autumn 2015 but far less wealthy than many smaller ones It has just over 3000 beds for visitors compared with tens of thousands on an island such as Rhodes Its councillors say that they will ght the tax rise although none can say how We have been suffering economically in recent years and now we will suffer more said Lemnos Mayor Dimitris Marinakis When there is not enough money you reduce your consumption and therefore the whole economy declines The crisis has been particularly hard on people under 40 who often do two or three jobs to make ends meet and still feel they cant afford a family Young people fear they are losing their contemporaries in an exodus to match the one that scattered their grandparents friends to America Australia and Canada What is the future for our generation said Katerina Fikari who feels she is extremely lucky to work for the local government in Lemnos If you work only to pay your bills how can you have dreams for your future If taxes go up even more young people will leave warns Mayor Kakali who has devoted her year in of ce to improving education on the island to help keep it an attractive place for families Because it is one of the smallest islands Agios Efstratios has until 2017 before the rise is due to come in so Kakali hopes that the roller coaster of Greek politics means it yet may be spared If not though she plans to travel to Athens to remind the distant government what the tax rise would cost The truth is the government doesnt pay much attention to the islands of the north Aegean she said so I would take all the kids from our school to the gates of parliament to tell them There is still life in these islands,The Greek island of

to avoid catastrophic shortages Humans derive about 20 of their protein from animalbased products now but this may need to drop to just 5 to feed the extra two billion people expected to be alive by 2050 according to research by some of the worlds leading water scientists There will not be enough water available on current croplands to produce food for the expected ninebillion population in 2050 if we follow current trends and changes towards diets common in western nations the report by Malik Falkenmark and colleagues at the Stockholm International Water Institute SIWI said There will be just enough water if the proportion of animalbased foods is limited to 5 of total calories and considerable regional water deficits can be met by a reliable system of food trade Dire warnings of water scarcity limiting food production come as Oxfam and the UN prepare for a possible second global food crisis in five years Prices for staples such as corn and wheat have risen nearly 50 on international markets since June triggered by severe droughts in the US and Russia and weak monsoon rains in Asia More than 18 million people are already facing serious food shortages across the Sahel Oxfam has forecast that the price spike will have a devastating impact in developing countries that rely heavily on food imports including parts of Latin America North Africa and the Middle East Food shortages in 2008 led to civil unrest in 28 countries Adopting a vegetarian diet is one option to increase the amount of water available to grow more food in an increasingly climateerratic world the scientists said Animal proteinrich food consumes five to ten times more water than a vegetarian diet One third of the worlds arable land is used to grow crops to feed animals Other options to feed people include eliminating waste and increasing trade between countries in food surplus and those in deficit Nine hundred million people already go hungry and two billion people are malnourished in spite of the fact that percapita food production continues to increase they said With 70 of all available water being in agriculture growing more food to feed an additional two billion people by 2050 will place greater pressure on available water and land The report is being released at the start of the annual world water conference in Stockholm Sweden where 2500 politicians UN bodies nongovernmental groups and researchers from 120 countries meet to address global water supply problems Competition for water between food production and other uses will intensify pressure on essential resources the scientists said The UN predicts that we must increase food production by 70 by midcentury This will place additional pressure on our already stressed water resources at a time when we also need to allocate more water to satisfy global energy demand which is expected to rise by 60 over the coming 30 years and to generate electricity for the 13 billion people currently without it said the report Overeating undernourishment and waste are all on the rise and increased food production may face future constraints from water scarcity We will need a new recipe to feed the world in the future said the reports editor Anders Jgerskog A separate report from the International Water Management Institute IWMI said the best way for countries to protect millions of farmers from food insecurity in subSaharan Africa and south Asia was to help them invest in small pumps and simple technology rather than to develop expensive largescale irrigation projects Weve witnessed again and again what happens to the worlds poor the majority of whom depend on agriculture for their livelihoods and already suffer from water scarcity when they are at the mercy of our fragile global food system said Dr Colin Chartres the Director General Farmers across the developing world are increasingly relying on and benefiting from smallscale locallyrelevant water solutions These techniques could increase yields up to 300 and add tens of billions of US dollars to household revenues across subSaharan Africa and south Asia,Water scientists have given one of the strongest warnings ever about global food supplies They say that the worlds population may have to change almost completely to a vegetarian diet by 2050 to avoid catastrophic shortages Humans get about 20 of their protein from animalbased products now However this may need to decrease to just 5 to feed the extra two billion people expected to be alive by 2050 according to research by some of the worlds top water scientists There will not be enough water to produce food for the expected ninebillion population in 2050 if we follow current trends and changes towards diets common in western nations the report by Malik Falkenmark and colleagues at the Stockholm International Water Institute SIWI said There will be just enough water if the proportion of animalbased foods is limited to 5 of total calories Warnings that water scarcity could limit food production come at the same time as Oxfam and the UN prepare for a possible second global food crisis in five years Prices for items such as corn and wheat have risen nearly 50 on international markets since June The price increase has been caused by severe droughts in the US and Russia and weak monsoon rains in Asia More than 18 million people are already facing serious food shortages across the Sahel Oxfam says that the price increase will have a devastating effect in developing countries that rely heavily on food imports including parts of Latin America North Africa and the Middle East Food shortages in 2008 led to fighting and riots in 28 countries Changing to a vegetarian diet is one way to increase the amount of water available to grow more food in a world where the climate is becoming increasingly erratic the scientists said Animal proteinrich food uses five to ten times more water than a vegetarian diet One third of the worlds arable land is used to grow crops to feed animals Other options to feed people include stopping waste and increasing trade between countries that have a food surplus and countries that dont have enough food Nine hundred million people already go hungry and two billion people are malnourished although percapita food production continues to increase they said Seventy per cent of all water is used in agriculture and growing more food to feed an extra two billion people by 2050 will place greater pressure on water and land The report is being released at the start of the annual world water conference in Stockholm Sweden where 2500 politicians UN groups nongovernmental groups and researchers from 120 countries meet to discuss global water supply problems Competition for water between

91,What is it like to look at the very last of something To contemplate the passing of a unique wonder that will soon vanish from the face of the earth Sudan is the last male northern white rhino on the planet If he does not mate successfully soon with one of two female northern white rhinos at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya there will be no more of their kind male or female born anywhere And it seems a slim chance as Sudan is getting old at 42 and breeding efforts have so far failed Apart from these three animals there are only two other northern white rhinos in the world both in zoos both female It seems an image of human tenderness that Sudan is lovingly guarded by armed men who stand vigilantly and caringly with him But of course it is an image of brutality Even at this last desperate stage in the fate of the northern white rhino Sudan is under threat from poachers who kill rhinos and hack off their horns to sell them on the Asian medicine market despite the fact that he has had his horn cut off to deter them Sudan doesnt know how precious he is His eye is a sad black dot in his massive wrinkled face as he wanders the reserve with his guards His head is a marvellous thing It is a majestic rectangle of strong bone and leathery esh a head that expresses pure strength How terrible that such a mighty head can in reality be so vulnerable It is lowered melancholically beneath the sinister sky as if weighed down by fate This is the noble head of an old warrior his armour battered his appetite for struggle fading Under his immense looming shoulder his legs protrude like squat columns from the tough tank of his body The way his foreleg emerges from his thick coat of skin reminds us how long human beings have been wondering at the natural spectacle that is the rhino For Sudan does not look so different from the rhinoceros that Albrecht Durer portrayed in 1515 They have the same little legs stuck out of a majestic body and they even lower their heads in the same contemplative way Durer was a Renaissance artist picturing an exotic beast from the exotic lands that Europe was starting to see more and more of In 1515 a live Indian rhinoceros was sent by the ruler of Gujarat in India to the king of Portugal he in turn sent it to the Pope but on the way it died in a shipwreck Human beings we always kill the things we love We have been doing so since the Ice Age There are beautiful pictures of European woolly rhinos in caves in France that were painted up to 30000 years ago These ancient relatives of Sudan share his heroic bulk mighty power and paradoxical air of gentleness A woolly rhino in Chauvet Cave seems agile and young a creature full of life But the same people who painted such sensitive portraits of Ice Age rhinos helped to kill them off As climate turned against the woolly megafauna with the end of the last Ice Age human spears probably delivered the coup de grace Today immense love is invested in rhinos yet they are being slaughtered in ever greater numbers The northern white rhino is the rarest species of African rhino There are far greater numbers of southern white rhinos and black rhinos But the demand in some countries for rhino horn as a traditional medicine believed to cure everything from u to cancer is fuelling a boom in poaching From 2007 when just 13 rhinos were killed by poachers in South Africa the killings have grown horri cally In 2014 1215 rhinos were slaughtered for their horns in South Africa 2015 already looks certain to beat that dreadful record The vulnerable northern white rhino has been hunted virtually to extinction in spite of every precaution in spite of the guards and their guns and other varieties of African rhino are under a sustained attack from poachers that is totally out of control The Javan rhinoceros is also on the verge of extinction India has successfully protected the Indian rhinoceros after it was almost wiped out by British hunters in colonial times but here too poaching is a menace What a majestic creature and what futile human destructiveness Have we learned nothing since the Ice Age,What is it like to look at the last of something Sudan is the last male northern white rhino on the planet If he does not mate successfully soon with one of two female northern white rhinos at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya there will be no more rhinos like them

bone and leathery esh a head of pure strength How terrible that such a powerful head can in reality be so vulnerable Sudan does not look so different from the rhinoceros that Albrecht Durer portrayed

2010 report with 75 of them having created at least one social media account In contrast only 50 of Generation X 30 of baby boomers and 6 of those aged 65 and older use social media But there is a small percentage of millennials who dont use social media at all Meet the millennials bucking the trend Celan Beausoleil 31 Oakland California Beausoleil is a social worker and has had an on and off more off than on relationship with Facebook She last deactivated her account in December 2015 after nding the amount of personal information shared by others too heavy to deal with on top of her work demands A lot of my job is listening to peoples lives all day every day and it started to feel so overwhelming to go on social media and see every single detail of everybodys life including people that I dont really have a relationship with she said It feels almost like intimacy overload She added Im holding a lot in my work life for people and sometimes it felt like it was too heavy to do in my personal life also But Beausoleil does love the way social media connects the world in a truly unique way citing it as one of her only reasons for staying on Facebook for as long as she did One thing I really liked about Facebook was that I could sit for hours and click on a friend and then click on one of their friends and one of their friends and one of their friends and literally end up on someones Facebook page from the other side of the world she said I used to do that all the time Jason Mathias 26 Baltimore Maryland One day I realized Im spending so much time doing this These

Would I enjoy it Mathias who works for the Baltimore City government had Facebook and Twitter accounts for years before deleting them both in November 2012 But he quickly forgot that Facebook existed after his impromptu decision to end his social media presence He can still appreciate the bene ts that come with having social media accounts like when he met his girlfriends friends for the rst time and realized humanizing 20 people youre meeting at a party is much easier if you can connect their faces hometowns and jobs to a photo later on Or how easy it is to organize large events online Mathias relies on friends for party invites and is sure there are times he slips through the cracks But now he relishes the time thats freed up He spends his lift rides and spare moments at work reading news articles and books rather than scrolling through a newsfeed And with no friends accounts to follow online he has to pick up the phone and call them something hes come to de nitely enjoy

more privacyminded and have concerns about giving out my data said Raskauskas who is currently looking for a job She recently deleted her Twitter account and deactivated her Facebook account two years ago after realizing she didnt like everyone knowing what I was doing But Raskauskas who was late to the Facebook game because her parents were really strict with technology can see the positive sides of social media When a friend of hers that shed lost track of moved to Naples for a month Raskauskas didnt even realize she was there until after shed left which the 22yearold said was a bummer But in the end her privacy concerns outweighed any bene ts social media could provide and she saw a de nite upside when she went through a recent breakup The last time a relationship of hers ended and she

abstaining from social media He claims that he hasnt seen any effect at this point Even though classmates post about parties and events on Facebook they make sure to send him a text message too he said Since I was young I was always a step behind on that kind of thing so it never really mattered to me he said In fact the only time Rajagopalan made use of social media was when it was unavoidable it was the only way to reach his new roommate at college Before starting his rst year at college he signed up for his rst and only social media account He joined Facebook in order to contact his future roommate and talk about their plans for that year Months later he still has the account but he admits I dont use it I dont check it or anything like that The most activity it sees is when his

75,The International Monetary Fund IMF has appealed to Washington to sort out its finances after the US pulled back from the brink of a debt default and hundreds of thousands of federal employees returned to work after a 16day government shutdown As the US President Barack Obama warned Weve got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis the IMFs managing director Christine Lagarde appealed for more stability It will be essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt limit in a more durable manner she said We also continue to encourage the US to approve a budget for 2014 and replace the sequester with gradually phasedin measures that would not harm the recovery and to adopt a balanced and comprehensive mediumterm fiscal plan A Senatedrafted peace deal that contained almost no concessions to the conservatives who had driven the country to the precipice of a new financial crisis was passed by the Republicandominated House of Representatives just hours before a deadline to extend the US debt limit was to pass The World Bank too expressed its relief that the global economy had dodged a potential catastrophe with its president Jim Yong Kim urging policymakers in all countries to continue to focus on crafting and implementing policies that promote economic growth and boost jobs and opportunity for all Stock markets in Japan China Hong Kong and South Korea initially reflected relief after the Republicans finally capitulated in their failed attempt to undermine Obamas healthcare reforms But in Asia and Europe stock markets overall displayed a muted reaction with traders apparently expecting another battle in Washington early in 2014 The shutdown is estimated to have cost the US 24bn according to the ratings agency Standard Poors Chinas official Xinhua News Agency had accused Washington of jeopardizing other countries dollar assets China is the US governments largest creditor Obama signed the necessary legislation to fend off a default shortly after midnight on Thursday after a Republican split in the House of Representatives The bill had passed easily with broad bipartisan support in the Senate where Democratic and Republican leaders forged the agreement It offers a temporary fix funding the government until 15 January and raising the debt ceiling until 7 February But the president made clear he did not expect another bitter budget fight and shutdown in 2014 In brief remarks at the White House shortly before the House vote Obama said he hoped the deal would lift the cloud of uncertainty that had hung over the country in recent weeks Once this agreement arrives on my desk I will sign it immediately he said in a statement delivered at the White House Hopefully next time it wont be in the eleventh hour Weve got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis As he left the lectern after his Wednesday night press briefing the president was asked by a journalist whether the crisis would happen all over again in a few months Speaking over his shoulder Obama replied No Earlier the Republican senator Mike Lee had struck a defiant tone perhaps indicating more trouble ahead The media keeps asking Was it worth it My answer is it is always worth it to do the right thing He added This is not over However the political deal was one of the worst of all possible outcomes for

137,Why do it Talking to the men earmarked to be the elite referees of the future the question elicits a knowing smile This season criticism of referees has increased to the point where some former referees have felt compelled to complain about standards That is quite striking because the more you talk to referees the more obvious it is that supporting each other through thick and thin is fundamental So why do it Why spend countless hours driving up and down the country to dole out rules some of which are inevitably going to upset people trying to climb the ladder until you get the chance to make decisions on television in front of millions who scrutinize you and your ability with the aid of umpteen different angles and slowmotion replays A glimpse of an answer appears on the face of Lee Swabey moments after he blows the final whistle of a 21 win for Grimsby over Woking a match at level 5 of the English league system He gets what all referees hope for every time they referee a match Twentytwo handshakes he explains afterwards proudly Symbolically a full set of handshakes plus a well done from both managers represents maximum satisfaction The buzz as he calls it of a game that passes smoothly is something he loves I wouldnt spend so much time away from my family if this didnt mean the world to me As one of the group that is highly regarded by the Professional Game Match Officials Limited PGMOL for his potential Swabey knew he was being watched at that match PGMOLs chief Mike Riley was in attendance along with Steve Dunn who is the coach for this level armed with notes and stopwatch to catalogue every significant move the officials make A few weeks earlier Riley Dunn and another former referee Peter Jones made their way to another level5 match to monitor another referee tipped to progress John Brooks I hope to have the opportunity to get promoted to the Premier League and officiate some of the top games in this country Brooks says The most the PGMOL delegation got to observe however was the way Brooks handled the somewhat tricky situation of calling off the match because of a frozen pitch It is all part of the experience Brooks needs to acquire before he is trusted with more highprofile games the different problems that need dealing with often clubs are very reluctant to have a late postponement particularly when they have to pay all the staff who have turned up but will not receive any gate money Brooks phoned his coach for advice and made the difficult but correct decision A little later the football club secretary arrived with envelopes to pay the officials for their time the match fee at level 5 is 95 so it is safe to assume these men do not do it for the cash Brooks like Swabey has clear ambitions to progress He is under no illusions that developing a thick skin and perfecting strategies to deal with disappointments is a big part of that How does he feel watching football on TV when a referee gets vilified Erm not great he admits Ive been in that situation once where I have made an incorrect decision and it was a deciding goal that was just offside Your heart sinks You cant stop thinking about it I do sometimes wish people understood the time and effort we put in It is very easy to criticize a decision but we do everything to try to get these decisions right In certain situations you are going to be unpopular but if you are uncomfortable with that you are probably in the wrong job The former referees agree that the backup education and tools that todays referees have is a world away from what they experienced in their own days Riley as a young referee went out and bought himself books on psychology and nutrition as there was no information on offer to him at all The former referees agree that the backup education and tools that todays referees have is a world away from what they experienced in their own days Riley as a young referee went out and bought himself books on psychology and nutrition as there was no information on offer to him at all Contrast this with Brooks who has a coach at the end of the phone They consult weekly discuss how his games have gone study footage of key decisions and work out how to improve He also has the support of a sports psychologist Liam Slack for regular guidance and an exercise regime to help him handle the 11km he runs during a game Brooks says psychology is vital in his development One of the things we have talked about is forgetting decisions and moving on he explains There may be a big decision to make in the first 30 seconds of the game Once you have made that you need to stay focused for the next 89 minutes and not be wondering whether that was correct or worrying about that decision Liam has taught us some techniques for releasing that decision Working with the sports psychologist is really important for mental toughness Jones believes the whole approach can only help I refereed in professional football but looking back I was an amateur he says I was going to work I worked for British Telecom and I might referee at Newcastle on a Wednesday evening and 9am the next morning I was in Leicester trying to speak to customers I perhaps hadnt slept Training was ad hoc We were amateurs in a professional environment compared to now When the subject of technology comes up the three former refs are unanimous in their support of it We are all in favour of anything that makes the referees job better and makes them more effective on the field of play says Riley Minimizing mistakes is the aim After all a bad decision can stick with you for a while The rest of your life notes Jones with a chuckle,Why do it The elite football referees of the future smile when you ask them this question This season criticism of referees has increased so much that some former referees have started to complain about standards That is quite significant because when you talk to referees it is obvious that supporting each other through thick and thin is fundamental So why do they do it Why spend hundreds of hours driving up and down the country Why enforce rules some of which inevitably upset people Why try to climb the

that you need to stay focused for the next 89 minutes and not be wondering whether that was correct or worrying about that decision Liam has taught us some techniques for forgetting that decision Working with the sports psychologist is really important for mental toughness On the subject of technology the three former referees are unanimous in their support of it We are all in favour of anything that makes the referees job better and makes them more effective on the pitch says Riley Minimizing mistakes is the aim After all a bad decision can stick with you for a while The rest of

188,Angela Erdmann never knew her grandfather He died in 1946 six years before she was born But on Tuesday 8th April 2014 she described the extraordinary moment when she received a message in a bottle 101 years after he had lobbed it into the Baltic Sea Thought to be the worlds oldest message in a bottle it was presented to Erdmann by the museum that is now exhibiting it in Germany It was very surprising Erdmann 62 said recalling how she found out about the bottle A man stood at my door and told me he had post from my grandfather He then told me that a message in a bottle had been found and that the name that was on the card was that of my grandfather Her visitor was a genealogical researcher who had managed to track her down in Berlin after the letter was given to the International Maritime Museum in the northern port city of Hamburg The brown beer bottle which had been in the water for 101 years was found in the catch of Konrad Fischer a fisherman who had been out in the Baltic Sea off the northern city of Kiel Holger von Neuhoff curator for ocean and science at the museum said this bottled message was the oldest he had come across There are documents that have been found without the bottle that are older and are in the museum he said But with the bottle and the document this is certainly the oldest at the moment It is in extremely good condition Researchers believe Erdmanns grandfather Richard Platz threw the bottle in the sea while on a hike with a nature appreciation group in 1913 He was 20 years old at the time Much of the postcard was indecipherable although the address in Berlin on the front of the card was legible as was the authors polite request that the note be sent by the finder to his home address He also included two stamps from that time that were also in the bottle so the finder would not incur a cost Erdmann said But he did not think it would take 101 years She said she was moved by the arrival of the message although she had not known her grandfather because he died at the age of 54 six years before she was born I knew very little about my grandfather but I found out that he was a writer who was very openminded and believed in freedom and that everyone should respect each other she said He did a lot for the young and later travelled with his wife and two daughters It was wonderful because I could see where my roots came from Like her grandfather Erdmann said she also liked culture and travelling around the world She described herself as openminded too What he taught his two daughters my mother taught me and I have then given to my sons she said Despite her joy at receiving the bottled message she said that she hoped others would not repeat what her grandfather had done and throw bottles with messages into the sea Today the sea is so full of so many bottles and rubbish that more shouldnt be thrown in there she said The message and the bottle will be on display at Hamburgs Maritime Museum until the beginning of May 2014 after which experts will attempt to decipher the rest of the text It is not clear what will then happen to the bottle but Erdmann hopes it will stay at the museum We want to make a few photos available to put with the bottle and give it a face so visitors can see the young man who threw the bottle into the water she said,Angela Erdmann never knew her grandfather He died in 1946 six

166,It has been called the hotel of mum and dad but few guesthouses have such favourable terms As the housing crisis bites a fifth of young adults are staying in the family home until they are at least 26 and the same proportion are not paying a penny towards their keep A recent survey found that the proportion of adults living at home varied around the country from just under 9 in the East Midlands to more than double that in London where house prices and rents are highest While many around the country contributed financially the survey found that 20 were paying nothing at all Young adults are being squeezed by low wages and rents which have hit record highs while those who want to buy a property are finding the monthly cost of renting is preventing them from saving enough to get on the housing ladder Research published by the homeless charity Shelter showed half of tenants were unable to save a penny towards a deposit while a quarter could only put by 100 or less each month Mortgages are cheaper than ever before thanks to record low interest rates but the best deals are still reserved for borrowers with large deposits Faced with this young adults are increasingly returning to the family home in order to save money and parents who cannot afford to offer their offspring a lump sum seem willing to help The survey found that 28 of adults were living at home because they were trying to save for a deposit However it also found that 30 were not saving any money A spokesman for the company conducting the survey commented The hotel of mum and dad is often staying open for longer than many anticipated our latest research shows Rental costs and deposits or the need to save for a mortgage deposit mean that some children understandably have to wait before flying the nest And for some moving out may never be an option Michael Day 30 who lives with his parents in Bristol says he has been caught between paying high rents and saving for a mortgage deposit Rents for a onebedroom home in the city are between 500 and 800 a month while buying a similar property would cost about 130000 I dont really want to move out to rent as its more than a mortgage but you need such a big deposit to get a mortgage so its been a bit of a vicious circle Day does not want to share with strangers so his options are limited At home he pays a nominal rent to cover bills and is able to keep the rest of his earnings from his job at a candle retailer He plays golf at county level and he admits that instead of saving he spends his spare cash on golf and holidays You need so much money that I will have to save for the foreseeable future he said Because its been so difficult Ive been going on holiday and enjoying it Sue Green of Saga a business that sells insurance and products to the over50s said the majority of parents may not have planned to have their children living with them well into their 20s or 30s Most will be more than happy to house them in the family home rentfree because it might help their kids get on the property ladder sooner she said Children who dont pay rent may contribute in other ways like buying groceries family takeaways or doing odd jobs around the home Angus Hanton cofounder of a thinktank called the Intergenerational Foundation said older generations were the architects of the housing crisis and children should not be blamed for staying at home The under30s have suffered a fall in average incomes of about 20 since the 2008 downturn Rents and car insurance have never been so high and mortgage lending rules have been tightened for the young but not for older buytolet investors who squeeze out the young he said Studentfee debt is rising rapidly yet many jobs on offer zerohour and shortterm contracts are turning

Merseyside in the family home where she grew up She moved out for a year to go to university but has been living with her parents ever since She works as a medical receptionist nearby so she wants to stay in the area But renting a onebedroom flat would cost more than 420 a month before bills which would take up a lot of her earnings I dont want to rent I dont want to spend all that money and have nothing at the end she said Ive looked at buying and seen mortgage advisers but I just cant borrow enough to get on the property ladder Gavin is trying to save but is struggling to amass the necessary funds You dont really see it building up as much as you need even a 5 deposit is such a lot of money and I would like to put down more she said Her parents are happy not to charge her rent They want me to try to save up and I contribute in other ways I bring food in and I do things around the house Gavin gets on with her parents and has her own space in a room that she moved into when she was 14

185,Setting aside epic disastermovie moments such as volcanoes hurricanes and earthquakes there are two key natural factors that can make a city vulnerable to gradual disintegration or even total disappearance water and sand Were climate change making the planet colder rather than hotter we could add ice to the list for nothing obliterates a city like a billiontonne glacier grinding its way down a valley The impact of a rare ice tsunami in 2013 on the Canadian municipality of Ochre Beach was just a taster a wall of melting iceberg on Dauphin Lake was blown by winds on to the shore splintering every house in its path But Ochre Beach was an anomaly Elsewhere the planets melting ice is making cities vulnerable by the less dramatic route of raising sea levels A century ago Venice one of the most beautiful and lowlying cities in the world used to ood around ten times a year Nowadays its lowest point Piazza San Marco only three feet above sea level is inundated with water approximately 100 times annually But rising sea levels are not entirely to blame In many parts of the world the land is also sinking in Venices case subsoil compaction a result of industrial exploitation of the surrounding area lowered the city by 20cm between 1950 and 1970 Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam is also sinking by about 2cm a year but thats nothing compared to Jakarta which is dropping 10 to 20cm annually In the past three decades the city has sunk roughly four metres rendering its 40yearold seawall ever less effective Unfortunately for the Indonesian capital it has pumped out so much groundwater to support its population that the land above is drying out and compacting thereby creating a bowl Rivers that used to ow through the city down to the sea have had to be diverted because they cannot drain uphill While there are many plans to save Venice and Ho Chi Minh City and Jakarta are taking the problem seriously the same cannot be said for Miami where politicians refuse to admit the city has a severe environmental problem Miamis dif culties are threefold The Florida resort lies less than ten feet above sea level an increasing number of tropical storms are inundating the city and it is built on porous limestone which is absorbing the rising seawater This water then lls the citys foundations and bubbles up through drains and pipes forcing sewage upwards and polluting its fresh water There is every chance Miami may one day become uninhabitable In the Maldives the populations of whole islands are now looking to abandon their homes The capital Male population 153379 and only four feet above sea level has used Japanese investment to build a tenfoot sea wall at a cost of 63 million but long term only a stabilization of rising sea levels will save it and the rest of the islands And its not just the sea rainfall is also endangering cities across the world Recently an entire summers worth of rain fell in one morning on Detroit overwhelming its outdated sewerage systems Impoverished by the collapse of Americas car industry the city is struggling to build a system to cope Drinking water is also affected because Detroit is particularly vulnerable to waterborne pathogens In Africa deserti cation is causing the Sahara to spread south at a rate of 30 miles per year threatening settlements in northern Mauritania Over the past 20 years for example the desert has grown by more than 260 acres around the trading and religious centre of Chinguetti which has seen its population decline from 20000 people in the midtwentieth century to just a few thousand now Trading has all but ceased as sand piles up in the streets Likewise the Californian resort of Rancho Mirage near Palm Springs may have to be abandoned in the next decade This city is just one example of a problem caused not so much by global warming as human overexpansion in the face of nite resources Californias dream of farming the desert made sense while its total population remained around half a million in 1870 but now the state is home to 38 million people who between them own 32 million vehicles and expect to be surrounded by lawns and golf courses The daily water use in Rancho Mirage is more than 200 gallons per person which is giving rise to a manmade drought A 25 cut in water consumption has been implemented but this is unlikely to stabilize the resort which is surrounded by sand and dust The longterm answer in Californias desert is likely to be the abandonment of some cities while consolidating the populations of others Human ight is the nal proof of a citys disintegration Once we stop maintaining a city nature takes over very quickly Japans Hashima Island was turned into a concrete city in 1887 to exploit undersea coal reserves but

36,The problem with Google Glasses says Takahito Iguchi is that theyre not cool He has a point Theres already a website dedicated to people wearing them looking either ridiculous or smug or more often both It possibly wasnt Googles smartest move to release the first 10000 pairs to software developers rather than say supermodels or Scarlett Johansson Search Google Images and one of the first hits is a picture of a large naked man wearing them in the shower And its this that Iguchi a Japanese entrepreneur hopes may be Googles Achilles heel He is launching a competitor that is a bit more stylized A bit more Blade Runner A bit more Japanese Iguchis augmented reality glasses which arent really glasses so much as a single piece of metal with a camera and a microprojector are called Telepathy One and after unveiling them at the South by Southwest festival in Austin Texas they have attracted 5m of venture capital Like Glass Telepathy One is due to launch in 2014 Its a strippeddown simplified version of Google Glass Whereas Glass is he says an egotistical device with a range of uses you can surf the net read emails take photographs do unspecified things with as yet unspecified apps Telepathy will be more of a communication device Connected via Bluetooth to your phone it will focus on realtime visual and audio sharing Youll be able to post photos and videos from your line of vision on Facebook or send them as an email Or see and speak to a floating video image of a friend It will help bring you close to your friends and family We are very focused on the communication and sharing possibilities says Iguchi who has worked in the Japanese tech industry for 20 years most recently developing a locationbased phone app called Sekai Camera Of course not everyone wants to get closer to the man in the futuristic headset I point out Iguchi shakes his head Im a visionary I have a dream that people will understand other people When I go to London I am a stranger Sometimes I feel fear But I believe that everyone wants to be understood and to understand each other And with this device you can know more information about people before you even speak to them Compared to the likes of Google of course Telepathy is a minnow Not that this seems to daunt Takahito Iguchi In his shared office space in San Francisco a cool converted warehouse in the heart of startup land filled with twentysomethings he quotes Sun Tzus The Art of War and points out that even tiny armies can sometimes beat mighty forces When he was growing up Japanese technology ruled the world the Sony Walkman was the iPhone of its day Now to compete hes had to quit Tokyo for Silicon Valley Tokyo is very rich in fashion and culture but its still an island Its isolated There is not any way to expand Whereas in Silicon Valley everyone is from everywhere Its where you come to connect globally The hardware will be made in Japan while he is putting together a team of software engineers in the US to develop its applications On the day I meet him hes being shadowed by a news crew from Japan who are interested in the new wave of Japanese entrepreneurs being forced to leave their homeland We are losing our confidence the correspondent Takashi Yanagisawa tells me And we need to find a way to regain our power Iguchi is kind of like the new frontier We hope he might be a new solution Building the prototype of Telepathy One was easy Iguchi says We have every sort of technology in Tokyo It is presenting it to the world that is the challenge The leading manufacturers are lining up to work with him he says because they have the technology they just struggle to sell it There needs to be a story to the product Like Apple did with the iPod 1000 songs in your pocket And the way they positioned themselves against Microsoft and IBM it was like the story of David and Goliath And Steve Jobs was inspired by Akio Morita the cofounder of Sony and he inspired me so maybe it will come in a circle Maybe He certainly has the confidence of Jobs although with a thick Japanese accent he sometimes struggles to make himself understood a fact that may have contributed to Telepathy Ones conception When he went to London to present the headset at the prestigious Founders Forum he stayed in an Airbnb The house owner was not my friend but I talked with him for three hours and now he is my friend That is how long it takes to understand each other to share our feelings and background and career Maybe Telepathy makes that shorter If you are getting info from the cloud and social networks that will happen more easily And this man is involved in getting investment from UK to Africa and he was very excited about Telepathy that it would be a way of educating people about Africa of showing them other peoples point of view This is Iguchis fondest hope that seeing somebody elses literal point of view will help you to see their metaphorical point of view As a student he explains he studied philosophy by day and taught himself how to code by night And one day I opened the door of my apartment and I suddenly realized that everything is code That was my enlightenment Everything

73,Amsterdam still looks liberal to tourists who were recently assured by the Labour Mayor that the citys marijuanaselling coffee shops would stay open despite a new national law tackling drug tourism But the Dutch capital may lose its reputation for tolerance over plans to dispatch nuisance neighbours to scum villages made from shipping containers The Mayor Eberhard van der Laan insists his controversial new 810000 policy to tackle antisocial behaviour is to protect victims of abuse and homophobia from harassment The camps where antisocial tenants will be rehoused for three to six months have been called scum villages because the policy echoes proposals from Geert Wilders the farright populist who last year demanded that repeat offenders be sent to a village for scum But Bartho Boer a spokesman for the Mayor denies that the plans are illiberal We want to defend the liberal values of Amsterdam he says We want everyone to be who he and she is whether they are gay and lesbian or stand up to violence and are then victims of harassment We as a society want to defend them According to Boer the villages are not for the regular nuisance between two neighbours where one has the stereo too loud on Saturday night but people who are extremely violent and intimidating and in a clear situation where a victim is being repeatedly harassed Those deemed guilty of causing extreme havoc will be evicted and placed in temporary homes of a basic nature including converted shipping containers in industrial areas of the city We call it a living container says Boer Housing antisocial tenants in

and is not planning to house the antisocial together It would be more accurate to call them scum houses than scum villages says Boer because we dont want to put more than one of these families in the

whole situation is not going to repeat at the new house they are in says Boer,To tourists Amsterdam still seems very liberal Recently the citys Mayor assured them that the citys marijuanaselling coffee shops would stay open despite a new national law to prevent drug tourism But the Dutch capitals plans to send nuisance neighbours to scum villages made from shipping containers may damage its reputation for tolerance The Mayor Eberhard van der Laan says his controversial new 810000 policy to deal with antisocial behaviour is to protect victims of abuse and homophobia The camps where antisocial families will be rehoused for three to six months have been called scum villages because the policy is similar to proposals from Geert Wilders the farright politician who last year said that repeat offenders should be sent to a village for scum Bartho Boer a spokesman for the Mayor says that the plans are not illiberal We want to defend the liberal values of Amsterdam he says We want everyone to be who he and she is whether they are gay and lesbian or resist violence and are then victims of harassment We as a society want to defend them According to Boer the villages are not for a problem neighbour who has the stereo too loud on Saturday night but people who are extremely violent and intimidating and in a clear situation where a victim is being harassed again and again People found guilty of causing extreme havoc will be evicted and put in basic temporary homes including converted shipping containers in industrial areas of the city We call it a living container says Boer Housing antisocial families in these units which have showers and kitchens and have been used as student accommodation will mean that they are not rewarded for their behaviour by being put in better accommodation Dutch newspaper the Parool has written that in the 19th century troublemakers were moved to villages in Drenthe and Overijssel which rapidly became slums But Boer insists that the

186,Crunchy full of protein and to be found under a rock near you Insects have long been overlooked as food in all but a handful of places around the world but now they are crawling closer and closer to our plates Spring 2013 will see a drive towards removing the yuck factor and putting insects not just on experimental gastronomic menus but also on supermarket shelves In April there will be a festival in London Pestival 2013 a Wellcome Trustbacked insect appreciation event where the consumption of creepycrawlies comes high on the agenda It will feature a twoday popup restaurant by the Nordic Food Lab the Scandinavian team behind the Danish restaurant Noma which brought ants to the table for a sellout tenday run at Claridges hotel in Mayfair in 2012 Noma has been named the worlds best restaurant by Restaurant magazine for three years running Its chef Ren Redzepi says that ants taste like lemon and a pure of fermented grasshoppers and moth larvae tastes like a strong fish sauce Bee larvae make a sweet mayonnaise used in place of eggs and scientists are constantly coming up with new ways to use little creatures In March a BBC documentary will feature food writer Stefan Gates searching out and eating deepfried locusts and barbecued tarantulas But behind all the gimmicks and jokes about flies in the soup there is a deeply serious message Many experts believe there is a clear environmental benefit to humans eating creepycrawlies The UNs Food and Agriculture Organization FAO has been funding projects since 2011 aimed at promoting the eating and farming of insects in southeast Asia and Africa where an estimated two billion people already eat insects and caterpillar larvae as a regular part of their diet In 2012 the FAO published a list of 1909 edible species of insect and with sponsorship from the Dutch government plans a major international conference on this valuable food source in 2013 Insects are plentiful globally for every human there are 40 tonnes of insects so there is not too much chance of them being endangered and they are unlikely to have been dosed with chemicals I know its taboo to eat bugs in the western world but why not Redzepi has said You go to southeast Asia and this is a common thing You read about it from all over the world that people are eating bugs If you like mushrooms youve eaten so many worms you cannot imagine But also we eat honey and honey is the vomit of a bee Think of that next time you pour it into your tea He said that the basic premise behind Nordic Food Lab was Nothing is not edible Insects are critical to life on Earth and with more than a million species are the most diverse group of creatures on the planet yet they are misunderstood hated and often put to death by humans just because they are there Over the next 30 years the planets human population will increase to nine billion Already one billion people do not get enough food The increase will mean more pressure on agricultural land water forests fisheries and biodiversity resources as well as nutrients and energy supplies The cost of meat is rising not just in terms of hard cash but also in terms of the amount of rainforest that is destroyed for grazing or to grow feedstuff for cattle There is also the issue of methane excreted by cows The livestock farming contribution in terms of greenhouse gas emissions is enormous 35 of the planets methane 65 of its nitrous oxide and 9 of the carbon dioxide Edible insects emit fewer gases contain highquality protein vitamins and amino acids and have a high foodconversion rate needing a quarter of the food intake of sheep and half of pigs and chickens to produce the same amount of protein They emit fewer greenhouse gases and less ammonia than cows and can be grown on organic waste China is already successfully setting up huge maggot farms Zimbabwe has a thriving mapone caterpillar industry and Laos was given nearly 500000 by the FAO to develop an insectharvesting project Its already big business in the UK though not always official a man was recently detained by Gatwick customs as he stepped off a flight from Burkina Faso with 94 kilos of mapone worth nearly 40000 in his luggage A study by FoodServiceWarehousecom suggested that swapping pork and beef for crickets and locusts could help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 95 But perhaps the fairest thing about eating worms and insects comes when we are dead then they get a chance to nibble their own back,Insects are not usually seen as food except in a few regions of the world but now they are crawling closer and closer to our plates In spring 2013 there will be an effort to show people that eating insects is not disgusting and also an attempt to put insects on supermarket shelves In April there

37,There are certainly MOOC junkies who take them for no other reason than theyre free and they like hanging out grins Dr Ben Brabon of Edgehill University whose massive open online course in vampire fiction is one of only two accredited MOOCs currently on offer in the UK Brabon isnt denigrating people who enrol on MOOC courses hes simply pointing out the motivation that prompts certain individuals to sign up When a course is open entry MOOCs have no enrolment criteria and no fees to pay then participants are going to behave very differently from students in a traditional higher education setting MOOCs are the newest big thing in the quest to enable higher education for all A great deal of venture capital money is being invested in the emerging online platforms which enable the delivery of increasingly sophisticated and interactive course content to participants who can number in the hundreds to the tens of thousands For these investors the Holy Grail is to find a business model for MOOCs that will make them profitable so far courses have depended on universities being prepared to bankroll their star lecturers curriculum design and online teaching time Mining the data captured about how why and when millions of participants opt to sign up interact with their material submit their assignments message each other and drop out of the course may be one way of getting a return on the investment Part of the dilemma around which future direction MOOCs will take however is that nobody can yet define whom exactly they are meant to benefit Universities keen to entice feepaying international students onto postgraduate courses by showing off their best programmes online Students in developing countries hungry for access to firstworld universities Employees wishing to develop their professional knowledge People lacking qualifications who want to use MOOCs as a bridge to higher education Or hobby learners who are keen to learn about a subject area in which they have an interest Though they may be popular to start off with MOOCs have dire completion rates observes Brabon For his vampire fiction course that meant 1000 enrolments and 31 completions And almost all of those had a first degree or had been educated to degree level he says So the MOOCs trend may not be opening up HE to sectors of the population it hasnt reached to date Learning online is a different thing needs quite advanced learning skills confirms David Kernohan progamme manager for eLearning Innovation at Jisc a charity that champions the use of digital technologies in UK education and research With MOOCs theres very little support available the student is dropped in and tends not to get any individual attention This is instead approximated by peer support such as online discussion forums While this may mean that online study is unattractive or difficult for someone without highlevel qualifications it does he says suggest that MOOCs could be a really good tool for continuing education At a time when the number of parttime students has fallen sharply as the price of a degree rises could this type of open and freetoaccess course provide a new path to universitylevel education Could an entire degree be taught via MOOCs I dont think thats how MOOCs work says Brabon Instead he suggests a blended approach that combines a campus experience with a MOOC also perhaps using MOOCs to create a global degree with students taking courses from across the world might be possible But thats a little way into the future for now no prospective employer will care much if you come waving your MOOC completion certificate without any quality assurance on either the course content or its assessment standards Accreditation is therefore now the central challenge that MOOCs must grapple with to gain credibility with academics and employers says Brabon who is on a Quality Assurance Agency working group aiming to develop an agreed approach to standards and marking There is idealism around the concept of MOOCs bringing the best of firstworld teaching to students in less developed countries But theres cynicism too with the suggestion that universities could use MOOCs to advertise their oncampus wares to greater numbers of lucrative though certainly not always wealthy students from outside the EU Mike Sharples chair of Educational Technology doesnt buy into that cynicism MOOCs are viewed primarily as a way to showcase and share universities best teaching talent as well as encouraging interaction and soliciting feedback from students around the world he says He believes that recruiting international students onto university courses is only a secondary objective of running MOOCs though they could certainly be a very canny marketing move as he observes that if 20000 people sign up to a MOOC well you only need 20 of those to enrol afterwards to run a masters Meanwhile any politically correct qualms about whether UK academic institutions are patronizing developing countries by exporting small snippets of elitist education may soon be entirely irrelevant warns Matthew Poyiadgi managing director at Pearson VUE I believe we may get to a situation in the future where universities maybe wont have a choice and where British universities are saying if we dont have a presence in China then well get left behind he says In South America China countries in Africa there is a huge appetite for learning and some of the worlds best courses are being offered online adds Sharples If people are genuinely fascinated by learning then why not The real challenge is to allow those countries not just to consume and study MOOCs but also to create them,Dr Ben Brabon of Edgehill University teaches a MOOC a massive open online course in literature The course is one of only two accredited MOOCs currently on offer in the UK According to Brabon many students enrol on MOOCs because they are free and they enjoy communicating with other students MOOCs have no enrolment criteria and no fees so students behave very differently from students on traditional higher education courses MOOCs are the newest big idea to try to make higher education available to everyone A lot of money is being invested in new online platforms that deliver sophisticated and interactive courses to tens of thousands of students Investors hope to find a business model for MOOCs that will make them profitable so far courses have depended on universities funding their star lecturers course design and online teaching time One way of making a return on the investment might be studying data about how why and when millions of students sign up interact with their material submit their assignments message each other and drop out of the course One of the questions about the future direction of MOOCs is that nobody can yet say who exactly they benefit Universities who want to attract feepaying international students onto postgraduate courses by showing off their best programmes online Students in developing countries who want access to firstworld universities Employees who wish to develop their professional knowledge People without qualifications who want to use MOOCs as a bridge to higher education Or hobby learners who want to learn about a subject area in which they have an interest MOOCs may be popular at the beginning but they have very poor completion rates says Brabon His literature course had 1000 enrolments and 31 completions And almost all of those had a first degree or had been educated to degree level he says So MOOCs may not be opening up higher education to sectors of the population it hasnt reached yet Learning online is a different thing and needs quite advanced learning skills confirms David Kernohan progamme manager

107,Lowincome countries will remain on the front line of humaninduced climate change over the next century experiencing gradual sealevel rises stronger cyclones warmer days and nights more unpredictable rainfall and larger and longer heatwaves according to the most thorough assessment of the issue yet The last major United Nations UN assessment in 2007 predicted runaway temperature rises of 6 C or more by the end of the century That is now thought unlikely by scientists but average land and sea temperatures are expected to continue rising throughout this century possibly reaching 4 C above present levels enough to devastate crops and make life in many cities unbearably hot As temperatures climb and oceans warm tropical and subtropical regions will face sharp changes in annual rainfall says the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC report released in Stockholm and published online in September East Africa can expect to experience increased short rains while west Africa should expect heavier monsoons Burma Bangladesh and India can expect stronger cyclones elsewhere in southern Asia heavier summer rains are anticipated Indonesia may receive less rainfall between July and October but the coastal regions around the South China Sea and Gulf of Thailand can expect increased rainfall extremes when cyclones hit land It is virtually certain that in the long term global precipitation will change High latitude countries such as in Europe or North America are expected to receive more rainfall but many subtropical arid and semiarid regions will likely experience less precipitation Over wet tropical regions extreme precipitation events will very likely be more intense and more frequent in a warmer world said the reports authors They added Monsoon onset dates are likely to become earlier or not to change much while monsoon withdrawal rates are very likely to delay resulting in a lengthening of the season Scientists in developing countries and commentators have welcomed the report which they said backed their own observations The IPCC makes the case that climate change is real and happening much more strongly than before We are already seeing the effects of climate change in Bangladesh and across south Asia Its not news to us Most developing countries are facing climate change now They do not need the IPCC to tell them that the weather is changing said Saleemul Huq director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development based in Dhaka Scientists have also lowered projections of sealevel rises Depending on future greenhouse gas emissions sea levels will rise an average of 4062 cm by 2100 Nevertheless there will be signifi cant geographical variations many millions of people living in the developing worlds great cities including Lagos and Calcutta are threatened Weather disasters are also more likely in a warmer world the report suggests Although the global frequency of tropical cyclones is expected to decrease or remain essentially unchanged they may become more intense with stronger winds and heavier rainfall Life in many developingcountry cities could become practically unbearable given that urban temperatures are already well above those in surrounding countryside Much higher temperatures could reduce the length of the growing period in some parts of Africa by up to 20 the report said Dr Camilla Toulmin director of the International Institute for Environment and Development says Climate models are not yet robust enough to predict impacts at local and regional scales but it is clear that everybody is vulnerable in some way The charity Oxfam predicted that world hunger would worsen as climate changes inevitably hurt crop production and disrupt incomes They suggested the number of people at risk of hunger might climb by 10 to 20 by 2050 with daily percapita calorie availability falling across the world The changing climate is already jeopardizing gains in the fi ght against hunger and it looks set to worsen said Oxfam A hot world is a hungry world If the remainder of the 21st century unfolds like its fi rst decade we will soon experience climate extremes well outside the boundaries of human experience,Lowincome countries will continue to be the most affected by humaninduced climate change over the next century They will experience gradual

44,He arrived in his own words in 2005 as a simple humble worker in Gods vineyard And on a grey cold blustery Monday in February Pope Benedict XVI signed off in the same fashion like an elderly labourer who can no longer ignore the pains in his back who can no more count on the strength of his arms Characteristically for this most traditionally minded of pontiffs he made his excuses in Latin The first German pope in modern times timed his departure to the minute From 28 February 2013 at 2000 hours he told a gathering of cardinals in the Vatican the see of Rome the see of Saint Peter will be vacant and a conclave to elect the new supreme pontiff will have to be convoked by those whose competence it is Among those present was a Mexican prelate Monsignor Oscar Sanchz Barba from Guadalajara He was in Rome to be told the date for a canonization in which he has played a leading role We were all in the Sala del Concistoro in the third loggia of the Apostolic Palace he said After giving the date for the canonization the twelfth of May the Pope took a sheet of paper and read from it We were all left Sanchz Barba looked around him in the Bernini colonnade that embraces St Peters Square grasping for the word as speechless as the princes of the church who had just heard the man they believe to be Gods representative on earth give up on the job The cardinals were just looking at one another Sanchz Barba said Angelo Sodano the Dean of the College of Cardinals who must have been forewarned delivered a brief and perhaps hurriedly composed speech Before going on to assure the Pope of the cardinals loyalty and devotion he said he and the others present had listened to you with a sense of bewilderment almost completely incredulous At the end of his address the Pope blessed those present and left It was so simple the simplest thing imaginable said Sanchz Barba Then we all left in silence There was absolute silence and sadness John Thavis who spent 30 years reporting on the Holy See and whose book The Vatican Diaries is soon to be published said he had had an intuition the Pope might be about to resign and timed his return to Rome from the US accordingly A fellowVatican watcher confirmed this to be the case Thavis noted that in the booklength interview Benedict gave to a German journalist published as Light of the World in 2010 he had made it clear he considered it would be right to go if he felt he were no longer up to the job I asked myself if I were Pope and wanted to resign when would I choose He has completed his series of books and most of his projects are off the ground What is more there were no dates in his calendar of events he personally had to attend I thought the most likely date was 22 February which is the Feast of the Chair of St Peter So I got it wrong The line emerging from the Vatican within hours of the announcement was that the Popes decision was a brave one By this account Benedict never one to shrink from utterances and decisions that shocked had taken it upon himself to bring his church face to face with reality the reality that contemporary medicine can keep men alive far beyond the age at which they are up to grappling with the demands of running a vast global organization Thavis agreed What I find particularly courageous is that he is prepared to say now when he is not sick that he is going and that hes doing it because hes tired and not because hes particularly ill But is that the whole story Does he know more about his state of health than the Vatican has so far made public Benedicts own account of his reasons makes it clear that he took into account not only his physical but also his psychological condition In order to govern the bark of Saint Peter and proclaim the Gospel both strength of mind and body are necessary strength which in the last few months has deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfil the ministry entrusted to me Other theories will no doubt swirl around the Vatican in the days and weeks ahead just as they did following the death of Pope John Paul I in 1978 33 days after his election Already there is speculation that something was about to come out about Benedicts past The Vatican will just as predictably dismiss such notions with contempt But they are understandable all the same for the transcendental importance of what Benedict has done cannot be overstated Emerging from St Peters Basilica Julia Rochester from London who described herself as a lapsed Catholic was still turning over the implications of the Popes resignation If youre Gods chosen one how do you choose not be chosen she mused It is a question many practising Catholics will be asking of their priests in the weeks ahead In his first speech as Pope humbly disclaiming his fitness for the task Benedict said I am consoled by the fact that the Lord knows how to work and how to act even with insufficient tools At some point in the last eight years it would seem he ceased to believe that was true,Pope Benedict XVI arrived in 2005 as a simple humble worker in Gods vineyard And on a grey cold windy Monday in February he resigned in the same way like an elderly labourer who can no longer ignore the pains in his back who can no longer rely on the strength of his arms A traditional Pope he made his excuses in Latin

72,An atmosphere of melancholy and changing times pervades the opening to the final series of Downton Abbey The year is 1925 and there are already the first rumblings of the economic storms that will blight the end of the decade The neighbours are selling up their own stately home while Lord Grantham seeks to cut back on servants after declaring that underbutlers are no longer affordable But at the real Downton Abbey Highclere Castle a stately home owned by George Geordie Herbert 8th Earl of Carnarvon the financial outlook has rarely been brighter According to Lady Fiona Carnarvon the huge global success of Downton has funded a rolling programme of building repairs aimed at safeguarding Highclere for the next generation Its been an amazing magic carpet ride for all of us she said Its given us a wonderful marketing platform an international profile Im hugely grateful My husband and I love the house and the people here Now without doubt it is loved by millions of other people Currently only the ground and first floors of Highclere on the borders of Hampshire are used But a restoration project of derelict tower rooms has begun that will eventually allow visitors to climb up into the tower to an exhibition showcasing the work of the architect of the Houses of Parliament Sir Charles Barry who rebuilt the house between 1839 and 1842 When the Downton Abbey producers first approached Highclere in 2009 the family faced a near 12m repair bill with urgent work priced at 18m But by 2012 the Downton effect had begun to take the pressure off Lord Carnarvon said then It was just after the banking crisis and it was gloom in all directions We had been doing corporate functions but it all became pretty sparse after that Then Downton came along and it became a major tourist attraction Visitor numbers doubled to 1200 a day as Downton Abbey scripted by Julian Fellowes came to be screened around the world after becoming a hit in the UK in 2010 and then in the US It is now broadcast in 250 countries The formerly somewhat basic ticketing policy has become a computerized advance booking system helping to guarantee foreign visitors admission The accounts of Highclere Enterprises for 201415 show current assets have almost trebled to around 1m since 2012 Gareth Neame the executive producer for the series said I think Downton Abbey secured Highcleres future Peter Fincham ITVs director of television recalls the moment when Highclere was booked I thought So what because I had never heard of Highclere Castle One stately home looks much the same as another How wrong I was The castle has been one enormous character as well The Downton tourists are part of a growing phenomenon VisitBritain estimates that nearly 30 of foreign visitors or nearly nine million people include castles and historic houses on their itineraries Almost half of potential visitors to Britain now say they want to indulge in set jetting visiting places featured in films or on TV More than a million embark on a tour of historic buildings each year spending in excess of 1bn From the biggest emerging tourist markets 51 of Brazilians 42 of Russians and Chinese and 35 of Indian visitors are likely to include a visit to a site of interest in their trips VisitBritains director Patricia Yates said The links between tourism films and TV are potent ones She added that period dramas have also raised the popularity of regions outside of London Neame is now an ambassador for the GREAT Britain campaign which is backed by government departments and the British Council using it to promote the UK around the world Events include special Downtonthemed receptions at British embassies Neame said They approached me because of the reach A lot of people here think of it as soapy entertainment In other parts of the world people revere our actors our writing and production talent It is something I am passionate about I am a really strong believer in soft power We are not nearly as proud of our achievements as we should be Downton Abbey is iconic for expressing Britishness Really it is a fantasy world based in a particular time in history Its the first TV period drama that has really leapt out of the screen and become part of popular culture Lady Carnarvon is still keen to emphasize that the longterm future of Highclere is not necessarily secure The bottom line is quite thin she said The programme has allowed us to spend faster on the buildings have the follies restored In the pipeline is a Tutankhamun centenary event in 2022 100 years after the 5th Earl of Carnarvon together with Howard Carter discovered the tomb that revolutionized our understanding of Egyptology Another opportunity to keep Highclere in the public mind is the 300th anniversary of the birth of Lancelot Capability Brown who designed the grounds What you do is never sit on your laurels Every single day dont take anything for granted said Lady Carnarvon For all these great houses you have to invest in them And there has been a deficit since the 1930s Perhaps in the past an estate and house defined and supported the family and their lifestyle but today it is quite the reverse the challenge is how Geordie and I seek to support and look after Highclere From my point of view Ive tried to persuade people it is fun and have specific events they can engage with not just a wander around a dusty house We have to compete with attractions like the London Dungeon,The atmosphere at the beginning of the final series of Downton Abbey is one of melancholy and changing times The year is 1925 The neighbours are selling up their own stately home while Lord Grantham wants to cut back on servants But at the real Downton Abbey Highclere Castle a stately home owned by George Geordie Herbert 8th Earl of Carnarvon they have more money than before According to Lady Fiona Carnarvon the huge global success of Downton has paid for building repairs that are needed to save Highclere for the next generation Its been an amazing magic carpet ride for all of us she said Its given us free marketing and an international profile Im hugely grateful My husband and I love Highclere Castle Now it is loved by millions of other people Currently only the ground and first floors of Highclere on the borders of Hampshire are used But a restoration project of tower rooms has begun that will eventually allow visitors to climb up into the tower to an exhibition showing the work of the architect of the Houses of Parliament Sir Charles Barry who rebuilt the house between 1839 and 1842 When the Downton Abbey producers first approached Highclere in 2009 the family had 12 million of repairs to do 18 million of that work was urgent But by 2012 Downton Abbey was having a positive effect Lord Carnarvon said then It was just after the banking crisis and we were worried Then Downton began and Highclere became a major tourist attraction Visitor numbers doubled to 1200 a day as Downton Abbey written by Julian Fellowes was shown around the world after becoming a hit in the UK in 2010 and then in the US It is now broadcast in 250 countries There is now a computerized advance booking system which helps

167,Ever since he was diagnosed HIV positive Moses King 48 has had one major problem He has been able to cope with the stigma of being HIV positive widespread in Liberia and he was able to access antiretroviral medication provided by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria and distributed by the Liberian government But King and his family of six children could not get the right food to eat A subsistence farmer he grew vegetables and bought rice But meat and fish expensive luxury products in Liberian markets but essential sources of protein remained elusive Subsistence farming allowed us to survive but we had so many problems said King We could not get any protein and we were not getting the nutrients we needed to sustain ourselves Pate K Chon a counsellor who works with HIV sufferers in Liberia provided an unlikely solution Since watching a documentary about a fish farm in Thailand several years earlier she had thought of setting up a similar project in Liberia enabling HIV sufferers to have work and also access a stable source of protein I saw this film about fish in a cement pool and I thought it was a good idea said Chon herself diagnosed with HIV in 1992 So many of the people I work with dont have the means to have a balanced protein diet and fish is such a clean source of protein it doesnt cause health problems like other sources and it is something we can farm Chon founder of a faithbased NGO began building a pool in which to farm fish In June 2012 Chon met John Sheehy a strategic philanthropist and founder of consultancy Emerging Business Lab who raised money for the nonprofit fish farm in the northeast of Monrovia Liberias capital and set about learning aquaculture doing an online course through Cornell University and speaking to other fish farmers in Africa I raised the money and built the farm learned the proper tank layout and water flow system said Sheehy A lot of my knowledge was selftaught and now I would love to be able to write a manual and share it with other people he added The project has now grown into the Grow2Feed Liberia Fish Farm with 12 tanks which when fully stocked will each have 5000 fish providing up to 200000 fish per year serving a community of 1200 predominantly HIVpositive people including King and his family In addition to the fish waste from the tanks is collected and used to irrigate crops also providing food and income for the community made up of 503 women 206 men and 346 children The members of the community live near the farm and have agreed to be part of the cooperative said Sheehy Many work on the farm or tending the crops and what they get in return when the fish are fully grown after 90 days is fish They can use those fish to feed themselves and to sell in the market so that they get money to buy other staple items The fish farm gives these people with HIV a way of getting back into society now they are bartering and trading with people in the market every week According to Liberias demographic health survey 15 of Liberias 35 million people are HIV positive with 60 of those women or girls Stigma and discrimination still surround the illness and have led to around half of all cases in the country going untreated Good nutrition is particularly important for people with HIV Research has shown they need much higher levels of protein to prevent their health from deteriorating and to allow healthy growth Nutrition is one of the key things if you are taking antiretroviral drugs said Chon The drugs are toxic and if you dont have food to eat they can make you very ill But food in Liberia is very expensive We buy expensive imported rice even though we should be growing it ourselves and fish is difficult for most people to afford Sheehy says Grow2Feed is the first cooperative fish farm in Liberia to operate for the benefit of an HIVpositive community The project has attracted the interest of the Liberian government and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization which has worked with Grow2Feed to provide training will also support teaching at the University of Liberia Fish farming experts say the practice has huge potential in Africa Fish farming is absolutely viable in Africa said Paul White owner of the HydroFish fish farm in Ivory Coast which produces 3000 tonnes of fish each year A lot of the fish on the market comes from China and is imported frozen It is of a quality that could never enter Europe or America There has been a serious lack of investment and a lack of knowhow in fish production It is all coming to the forefront now he added Some critics are sceptical of farmed fish citing inbred fish and high levels of toxins But Sheehy said good practice mitigated these problems A lot of farmed fish is inbred which does cause problems but we are using a process with local fish sourced in Liberia not fish from another region said Sheehy That means we can continue using local fish to bring in new broodstock And we are not using lakes that are cornered off where the fish absorb all the toxins in the lake We can control the environment using the tanks and we test the water and monitor it constantly Sheehy hopes to replicate the model throughout Liberia and the region A ricegrowing coop in Sierra Leone asked us if we could do this on our property so that they can feed their workers and we have had interest from Nigeria and Central America said Sheehy But we operate 100 nonprofit and we will never lose our social justice aspect,Ever since he was diagnosed HIV positive Moses King 48 has had one major problem

59,The world shares him and London claims him but StratforduponAvon intends to spend 2016 celebrating William Shakespeare as their man the bard of Avon born in the Warwickshire market town in 1564 who died there 400 years ago Stratford remained hugely important throughout Shakespeares life argues Paul Edmondson the head of learning and research at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust People have seen Shakespeare as someone who turns his back on Stratford and his family goes to London to earn his fortune and only comes back to die he said But Stratford is where he bought land and property where he kept his library where he lived and read and thought We are going to spend the year reemphasizing the importance of Shakespeare the man of Stratford The seveneenthcentury diarist antiquarian and gossip John Aubrey born 11 years after Shakespeare died was at pains to point out there was nothing so very special about the bard Aubrey university educated unlike Shakespeare said that he acted exceedingly well and that his Playes took well The world has not agreed with Aubrey The anniversary of the death of the man from Stratford the most famous and the most performed playwright in the world will be marked across Britain and the globe Macbeth will open in Singapore Romeo and Juliet in Brussels Shakespeares Globe is completing the rst world tour in the history of theatre in which it has taken Hamlet to almost every country North Korea is still holding out In London they are also creating a 37screen popup cinema one screen to showcase each of Shakespeares plays along the South Bank The National Theatre the Royal Shakespeare Company and virtually every other theatre production company in the country will be marking the anniversary Interpretations will range from the resolutely traditional to the Brightonbased Spymonkeys Complete Deaths a romp through the 74 deaths 75 including a y squashed in Titus Andronicus by stabbing poisoning smothering and smashing across

evidence for Shakespeares life and times The plays would scarcely have survived if his friends and fellow actors had not gathered together every scrap of every play they could nd drafts prompt scripts scribbled actors parts and 17 plays not known in any other version into the precious First Folio published in 1623 seven years after Shakespeares death The actor Mark Rylance has called it his favourite book in the world and most of the surviving First Folios will be on display including those belonging to the British and Bodleian libraries and a tattered copy recently discovered in France Some of the most precious surviving documents will be gathered together in an exhibition at Somerset House in London jointly organized by the National Archives and Kings College London including four of his six known signatures which are all slightly different The exhibition By Me William Shakespeare will include his will the court papers relating to the audacious move when Shakespeare and his fellow actors dismantled a theatre on the north side of the Thames and rebuilt it as the Globe on the South Bank and accounts showing payments from the royal treasury for Boxing Day performances for James I and Queen Anne The outgoing Globe director Dominic Dromgoole recently jokily claimed Shakespeare as a true Londoner albeit conceding some spurious claim by StratforduponAvon Stratford however will be insisting that the town made and educated Shakespeare His old school room is being restored with a 14m Heritage Lottery grant and will open as a permanent visitor attraction Shakespeare bought the splendid New Place the second best house in the town where he died according to literary legend on St Georges Day 23 April the same day as his birth You dont buy a house like New Place and not live there Paul Edmondson said The general public and many academics have consistently underestimated the importance of Stratford to Shakespeare Edmondson believes that after Shakespeare bought the house in 1597 all his thinking time was spent there and that the late plays including The Tempest were at least planned in his library and probably written there The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust describes New Place as the jewel in the crown of the 400th anniversary celebrations but in truth it is more of a gaping hole where the gem should be Shakespeares house was demolished 300 years ago and the house that replaced it probably incorporating some of the original fabric was attened in 1759 by an irascible clergyman Francis Gastrell in a row over taxes He had already cut down Shakespeares mulberry tree under which the writer is said to have sat and worked because he was irritated by all the tourists peering into his garden The gap in the Stratford streetscape has never been lled but a veyear archaeology project has peeled back the years and the news that Shakespeares kitchen had been found in the partly surviving cellars went round the world The whole site is being redisplayed for

70,Barack Obama flew back to Washington and his desk in the Oval Office on Wednesday hours after delivering an election victory speech in Chicago in which he called for the country to unite behind him You voted for action not politics as usual Obama said in his address but there was little sign that his call would be answered with the President facing the prospect of doing business with a hostile Republicanled House of Representatives for at least another two years and a looming showdown over spending and debt the socalled fiscal cliff Unlike after his election in 2008 the President is unlikely to be given a honeymoon period Both the Republican House Speaker John Boehner and the Democratic Leader in the Senate Harry Reid spoke about a need to work together to resolve the crisis but it could turn into one of the biggest clashes yet between the White House and Congress under Obamas presidency While Obama easily beat off the challenge from his Republican opponent Mitt Romney holding swing state after swing state the election provided yet another reminder of just how divided America remains While the inauguration is not until January in effect Obama embarked on his second term on Wednesday Having disappointed many supporters in his first term he is looking now to establish a legacy that will transform him from a middling president into a great one As well as overseeing what he hopes will be continued economic recovery he hopes to address issues ranging from immigration reform to investment in education and climate change and in foreign policy from Iran to IsraelPalestine As well as comfortably winning more than the required 270 electoral college votes he also secured a higher share of the popular vote Boehner in a statement sounded conciliatory He cited the need for both parties to find common ground and take steps together to help our economy grow and create jobs which is critical to solving our debt Obama is reported to have phoned Boehner to begin negotiation Reid so often at odds with Boehner also sounded conciliatory saying I look at the challenges that we have ahead of us and I reach out to my Republican colleagues in the Senate and the House Lets come together We know what the issues are lets solve them Obama in an initially offtherecord interview during the campaign expressed optimism of a grand bargain with the Republicans one that eluded him in 2011 The trouble will come when talks move to detail with the Republicans wanting to protect military spending while the Democrats seek cuts Obama has called for tax increases on households earning more than 250000 Boehner has rejected any tax increases Shares dropped on the Dow in anticipation of continued gridlock By lunchtime all the major US markets were down over 300 points The new House which will be formed in January will look much like the existing one which has a huge Republican majority The Senate too remained little changed with the Democrats retaining their slim majority gaining three and losing one In the presidential race Romney won only one of the swing states North Carolina while Obama held New Hampshire Virginia Ohio Wisconsin Nevada Iowa and Colorado In his victory speech in Chicago Obama referred to the long queues to vote and said there was a need for electoral reform He returned to the soaring rhetoric that was his trademark during the 2008 election but which he dispensed with in 2012 Amid the disillusionment with his presidency and the tough economic conditions his campaign team decided it was inappropriate But having won he returned to famous lines from earlier speeches reprising once again his 2008 slogan about hope Stepping up to the lectern to the upbeat sounds of Stevie Wonders Signed Sealed Delivered Im Yours Obama told the ecstatic crowd of supporters Tonight in this election you the American people reminded us that while our road has been hard while our journey has been long we have picked ourselves up we have fought our way back And we know in our hearts that for the United States of America the best is yet to come In a speech that lasted more than 25 minutes after paying emotional tribute to his wife Michelle and his daughters Malia and Sasha as well as to his VicePresident Joe Biden Obama returned to the message that first brought him to national attention We are not as divided as our politics suggests he said Were not as cynical as the pundits believe We are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states We are and forever will be the United States of America Obama made clear he had an agenda in mind for his second term citing changes in the tax code immigration reform and as he put it an America that isnt threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet Shortly beforehand Romney had phoned the President to concede In a gracious concession speech in Boston Romney told his supporters The nation as you know is at a critical point At a time like this we cant risk partisan bickering and political posturing Our leaders have to reach across the aisle to do the peoples work He continued This is a time for great challenges for America and I pray the President will be successful in guiding our nation The campaign almost throughout has been a referendum on Obama Although there was widespread disillusionment with the slow pace of economy recovery and a high unemployment level Americans decided to stick with him Historically it would have been a disappointment for African Americans and many

159,There comes a time in some mens lives when the days seem darker mortality more certain and the only sensible response is to blow the life savings on a sportscar Radical and often illadvised changes in lifestyle have become the calling cards of the midlife crisis but if it is more than a myth then humans may not be the only animals to experience it Now an international team of scientists claims to have found evidence for a slump in wellbeing among middleaged chimpanzees and orangutans The lull in happiness in the middle years they say is the ape equivalent of the midlife crisis The study which was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has raised eyebrows among some scientists but according to the authors the findings suggest that the midlife crisis may have its roots in the biology humans share with our closest evolutionary cousins Theres a common understanding that theres a dip in wellbeing in middle age Alex Weiss a psychologist at Edinburgh University told the Guardian We took a step back and asked whether its possible that instead of the midlife crisis being humanspecific and driven only by social factors it reflects some evolved tendency for middleaged individuals to have lower wellbeing he said The team from the US Japan Germany and the UK asked zookeepers carers and others who worked with male and female apes of various ages to complete questionnaires on the animals The forms included questions about each apes mood the enjoyment they gained from socializing and their success at achieving certain goals The final question asked how carers would feel about being the ape for a week They scored their answers from one to seven More than 500 apes were included in the study in three separate groups The first two groups were chimpanzees with the third made up of orangutans from Sumatra or Borneo The animals came from zoos sanctuaries and research centres in the US Australia Japan Canada and Singapore When the researchers analyzed the questionnaires they found that wellbeing in the apes fell in middle age and climbed again as the animals moved into old age In captivity great apes often live to 50 or more The nadir in the animals wellbeing occurred on average at 283 and 272 years old for the chimpanzees and 354 years old for the orangutans In all three groups we find evidence that wellbeing is lowest in chimpanzees and orangutans at an age that roughly corresponds to midlife in humans Weiss said On average wellbeing scores are lowest when animals are around 30 years old The team explains that the temporary fall in ape wellbeing may result from watching depressed apes dying younger or through agerelated changes in the brain that are mirrored in humans Weiss conceded that unlike men apes are not known to pursue radical and often disastrous lifestyle changes in middle age Robin Dunbar Professor of Evolutionary Psychology at Oxford University was dubious about the findings What can produce a sense of wellbeing or contentedness that varies across the lifespan like this Its hard to see anything in an apes life that would have that sort of pattern that they would think about Theyre not particularly good at seeing far ahead into the future thats one of the big differences between them and us Alexandra Freund Professor of Psychology at the University of Zurich was also sceptical She said the concept of a midlife crisis was shaky even in humans In my reading of the literature there is no evidence for the midlife crisis If theres any indication of decline in emotional or subjective wellbeing it is very small and in many studies its not there at all But Weiss believes the findings could point to a deeper understanding of the emotional crisis some men may experience If we want to find the answer as to whats going on with the midlife crisis we should look at what is similar in middleaged humans chimps and orangutans he said,There comes a time in some mens lives when

110,Brazil experienced one of its biggest nights of protest in decades as more than 100000 people took to the streets nationwide to express their frustration at heavyhanded policing poor public services and high costs for the World Cup The major demonstrations in Rio de Janeiro So Paulo Brasilia Belem Belo Horizonte Salvador and elsewhere started peacefully but several led to clashes with police and arson attacks on cars and buses The large turnout and geographic spread marked a rapid escalation after previous smaller protests against bus price increases led to complaints that police responded disproportionately with rubber bullets tear gas and violent beatings Coinciding with the start of the Confederations Cup a World Cup test event the rallies brought together a wide coalition of people frustrated with the escalating costs and persistently poor quality of public services lavish investment in international sporting events low standards of health care and wider unease about inequality and corruption While the vast majority of demonstrations in Rio were peaceful several police were injured in clashes at the citys legislative assembly at least one car was overturned and burned and windows were smashed in the offices of banks and notary offices The unrest escalated during the night as a large crowd set several fires outside the legislative assembly smashed the buildings windows and painted graffiti on the walls proclaiming Revolution Down with Paes down with Cabral the mayor and state governor and Hate police Police inside responded with pepper spray and perhaps more the Guardian saw one protester passed out and bleeding heavily from a wound in the upper arm The causes pursued by the protesters varied widely We are here because we hate the government They do nothing for us said Oscar Jos Santos a 19 year old who was with a group of hooded youths from the Rocinha favela Im an architect but I have been unemployed for six months There must be something wrong with this country said Nadia al Husin holding up a banner calling on the government to do more for education At a far smaller rally in Brasilia demonstrators broke through police lines to enter the highsecurity area of the national congress Several climbed onto the roof In Belo Horizonte police clashed with protesters who tried to break through a cordon around a football stadium hosting a Confederations Cup match between Nigeria and Tahiti In Porto Alegre demonstrators set fire to a bus and in Curitiba protesters attempted to force their way into the office of the state governor There were also rallies in Belem Salvador and elsewhere In So Paulo which had seen the fiercest clashes the previous week and the main allegations of police violence large crowds gathered once again but initial reports suggested the marches passed peacefully Reflecting the importance of social networks in spreading the message about the protests some in So Paulo where numbers were estimated at between 30000 and 100000 carried banners declaring We come from Facebook Most protesters were young and for many it was their first experience of such a giant rally My generation has never experienced this said Thiago Firbida a student Since the dictatorship Brazilians never bothered to take over the streets They did not believe they had a reason to But now Brazil is once again in crisis with a constant rise in prices so people are finally reacting Comparisons have been drawn with rallies in Turkey and elsewhere Another global link was evident in the handful of demonstrators who wore Guy Fawkes masks associated with Anonymous and the Occupy Wall Street protests Brazils demonstrations are being referred to as the vinegar revolution after police arrested people for carrying vinegar to counter tear gas as well as the 20cent revolution due to the bus price rise and the Passe Livre after the demand for free public transport Some said the protests felt unBrazilian but liberating Our politicians need to see the strength we have as one people Brazilians tend to be too nice sometimes they enjoy partying rather than protesting but something is changing said Deli

protests Before the opening match in Brasilia crowds of demonstrators were dispersed by riot police Footage showed frightened Japanese supporters rushing from the area holding their children as the

16,Wales will become the first country in the UK where people will be presumed to have consented for their organs to be donated unless they opt out The Welsh Assembly has voted to adopt the optout policy which will allow hospitals to act on the assumption that people who die want to donate unless they have specifically registered an objection The final stage of a bill to adopt a system of presumed consent was passed by 43 votes to eight with two abstentions in spite of objections from religious groups on moral grounds and concerns that the scheme could add to the distress of grieving families This is a huge day for Wales for devolution and most importantly for the 226 people in Wales waiting for an organ transplant said the Welsh Health Minister Mark Drakeford I am proud that Wales will be the first nation in the UK to take this step As a society we have shown we are prepared to take action to increase organ donation and to provide hope to those people waiting every week for a transplant Family refusal is a major factor that affects the numbers of organ donations and the main reason for refusal is lack of knowledge of their loved ones wishes The family of the potential donor has a major role to play in organ donation The aim of the bill has always been to respect the wishes of the deceased however relatives or friends may object to consent being deemed based on what they know about the views of the deceased When family members know that organ donation is what the deceased would have wanted they usually agree to participate in the donation process The new law will work by clarifying peoples wishes around the issue of organ donation and in turn increase the rate of consent to donation Today is a landmark day for Wales and I expect the rest of the UK to be watching with great interest when the legislation is implemented in 2015 The issue is controversial with opponents worried that the pressing need for more kidneys and hearts will lead to the wishes of those who have died and their family being overruled But ministers insist there will be safeguards Inevitably some people will not get around to registering their opposition In response to concerns the government recently announced that families would play a bigger role Relatives are to have a clear right of objection giving them the chance to show that the deceased would not have wanted to be an organ donor Wales has acted because of an acute shortage of organs We have the enduring problem of not having enough organs for people who need them said Drakeford About one person every week dies in Wales while on a waiting list We have been working to improve the rate of organ donation and have had some success but were looking to take the next step forward Around a third of the Welsh population is on the organ donor register but well over twothirds in surveys say they are happy to be organ donors That other third is people who dont get round to putting their names down Were hoping to make inroads into that The new law would apply to anybody over 18 who has lived in Wales for at least the year before his or her death Donated organs would not only go to people in need of a transplant in Wales but to anybody in the UK Doctors are delighted at the move The British Medical Association has long campaigned for an optout system because of its concern over the growing number of people needing transplants a result of medical progress in transplantation The number of young donors dropped substantially when seatbelt legislation came in Big efforts have been made in recent years to increase the number of those who carry an organ donation card with a good deal of success Hospitals have also brought in improved systems for coordinating transplants including the crucial discussions with relatives when there is no indication of the wishes of the deceased But the increase in numbers of organs harvested is still not enough Some religious groups on the other hand strongly oppose the scheme arguing that it would cause further distress to bereaved relatives Members of the Muslim Council of Wales and the South Wales Jewish Representative Council have expressed reservations while the Archbishop of Wales Barry Morgan said that donation ought to be a gift of love of generosity If organs can be taken unless someone has explicitly registered an objection thats not an expression of love Its more a medical use of a body,Wales will become the first country in the UK that will presume people have consented to donate their organs unless they opt out The Welsh

its a matter of public safety Paul Misener Amazons vicepresident of global public policy told a congressional hearing recently that his company would be ready as soon as all the rules were in place but Misener gave no hints as to what that would look like beyond joking with a congressman that there was a basket of fresh fruit on the way to his doorstep to demonstrate the technologys viability The Federal Aviation Authority FAA will nally have regulations governing the commercial use of unmanned aircraft by June 2016 But the technology has a long way to go before then and larger machines arent airwaylegal at all yet only drones up to 25kg will be covered and the FAA points out in the proposed rules that if youre going to crowd the skies with radiocontrolled ying robots they had better all be using different radio frequencies that nobody can jam or hijack Professor Sajiv Singh of Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute who runs a critical cargo delivery company called NearEarth said that piloting a stateoftheart drone was a little more like leaving it a trail of breadcrumbs go to this altitude perform this short task go back home But even short ights from a mobile landing pad pose serious logistical problems he said Theyre not proposing to deliver from one uninhabited place to another uninhabited place theyre proposing to deliver from a warehouse to where the consumer is which is likely an urban area or a suburban area he said In those particular cases there are going to be hazards along the way that the vehicle is going to have to detect Maybe there will be terrain that the map doesnt know about unless youve mapped that exact route before Even then maybe theres construction equipment that wasnt there but is there now Maybe GPS signals are blocked or partially blocked in which case its going to have an incorrect idea about where it is All this is surmountable he said but its difficult One major problem is maintaining radio contact with a drone and planning for what happens if that contact breaks If you have an offtheshelf UAV unmanned aerial vehicle itll just keep going and crash into the ground said roboticist Daniel Huber Thats not a hard problem for an engineer to x its just that the x isnt yet an industry standard Furthermore you cant do everything with a 25kg aircraft said Jay McConville director of business development for unmanned systems at defence and business contractor Lockheed Martin MST Much of the focus at Lockheed Martin has been on making drone piloting interfaces less like elaborate ight simulators Those of us in the aircraft business have to remind ourselves that the operator doesnt really care about every little thing about the aircraft and wants instead to focus on the end result he said Operators want to see vehicle status information they want to see video on their handheld device or their laptop Technologically most of the things that are needed for this are in place said Huber He is working on a program that proposes using drones to inspect infrastructure pipelines telephone lines bridges and so on Weve developed an exploration algorithm where you draw a box around an area and itll autonomously y around that area and look at every surface and then report back Huber a senior scientist at Carnegie Mellons Robotics Institute where he works on 3D systems imagery said with respect to a program like Amazons I have heard them say that many packages are lightweight a drone can carry a kilogram for 15 minutes If you have a vehicle that can go into a neighbourhood it can deliver from that base You need a 15minute distance and typical offtheshelf drones have about that distance Its one way he said of making sure the surrounding population is relatively safe The larger you get the more dangerous you get Logistical problems are in the middle of being solved in some very dramatic ways Huber said At a recent conference he said a disaster relief drone rm SkyCatch demonstrated a robot that could autonomously take off and when it got tired land on its own charging station It would land and take off and when it ran low on batteries it would land exchange the batteries and take off again he said Of course safety remains a major concern Singh points out that for a commercial aircraft to be considered skyworthy it has to prove a rate of one serious failure every 1m hours Drones he said are one or two orders of magnitude away from that benchmark The Reaper drone has one failure in 10000 hours Singh said An oil leak by the way doesnt count as catastrophic failure something has to fall out of the sky Were closing the gap Singh said Theres a lot of interest Part of this is simply that air travel is inherently dangerous and thus standards are much higher If you y commercial airlines often theyll say Oh a component has failed we have to go back to the gate Singh said And thats an established industry with 60 years of legacy I shudder to think that one of these things might come down on a crowded highway Part of the solution Singh said is simple contingency planning If things fail the vehicle has to do something reasonable,Will we soon live in a world where drones deliver packages If you believe Amazon the answer is yes Others are not so sure we need to make more technical progress in this area but there is also the problem of public safety Amazon spokesman Paul Misener told a US congress hearing recently that his company would be ready as soon as all the rules were in place The Federal Aviation Authority FAA will nally have regulations on the commercial use of unmanned aircraft by June 2016 But the technology has a long way to go before then and larger machines arent legal yet only drones up to 25kg will be legal And the FAA says that if youre going to crowd the skies with radio controlled ying robots they must all use different radio frequencies that nobody can jam or hijack Professor Sajiv Singh who runs a cargo delivery company

71,The Senate Intelligence Committee has approved a bill that would provide for increased transparency of the National Security Agencys bulk collection of US phone records but allow the controversial practice to continue Sponsored by Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein the bill lets the NSA continue to collect phone metadata of millions of Americans for renewable 90day periods and allows the government to retain it Some legislators have alternatively proposed letting phone companies hold the metadata It passed the committee by an 114 vote paving the way for a full Senate vote The bill allows analysts to search through the data if they suspect there is a reasonable suspicion that a suspect is associated with international terrorism Additionally the bill allows the NSA to continue surveillance begun on foreigners outside the US if they enter the country for a transitory period not to exceed 72 hours The bill is a direct challenge to one introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy that would end domestic phonerecords collection It was also opposed by leading Intelligence Committee member Mark Udall who said it did not go far enough The NSAs invasive surveillance of Americans private information does not respect our constitutional values and needs fundamental reform not incidental changes Unfortunately the bill passed by the Senate Intelligence Committee does not go far enough to address the NSAs overreaching domestic surveillance programmes Udall said Another Democratic member of the committee Ron Wyden said the bill maintains business as usual and remains far from anything that could be considered meaningful reform Feinstein defended the NSA bulk collection programme but said there was a need to rebuild public trust The NSA callrecords programme is legal and subject to extensive congressional and judicial oversight and I believe it contributes to our national security she said in a statement But more can and should be done to increase transparency and build public support for privacy protections in place In her statement Feinstein said the bill would also make a number of improvements to transparency and oversight on the NSA including requiring an annual public report of the total number of queries of NSAs telephone metadata database and the number of times the programme leads to an FBI investigation or probable cause order requiring that the foreign intelligence surveillance court impose limits on the number of people at NSA who may authorize or query the callrecords database establishing criminal penalties of up to ten years in prison for intentional unauthorized access to data acquired under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act FISA by the United States mandating the FISA court impose a limit on the number of contacts an analyst can receive in response to a query of bulk communication records After the committees hearing had ended Feinstein strongly endorsed the NSAs main domestic programme I think theres huge misunderstanding about this NSA database programme and how vital it is to protecting this country she told reporters Concern over the Intelligence Committees bill was expressed by independent legal experts who said the stage was now set for a showdown with the USA Freedom Act a bill introduced by Leahy and Jim Sensenbrenner that would prohibit bulk collection of Americans telephone records Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice said The Intelligence Committee bill and the USA Freedom Act present two opposing visions of the relationship between lawabiding Americans and the national security state The fundamental question is should the government have some reason to suspect wrongdoing before sweeping up Americans most personal information to feed into its databases Leahy and Sensenbrenner say yes Feinstein says no Wyden suggested that recent concern about NSA spying on foreign leaders had distracted from the real focus on mass domestic surveillance in the US The statements that American intelligence officials have made about collecting on the intentions of foreign leadership thats consistent with the understanding Ive had for years as a member of the Intelligence Committee he said That has implications for foreign policy My top priority is ending the mass surveillance digital surveillance of millions and millions of lawabiding Americans Feinstein unexpectedly announced that she was totally opposed to the foreign leader spying of the sort the NSA conducts of German Chancellor Angela Merkel Feinstein has been a staunch supporter of the NSAs bulk collection of Americans phone records Americans are making it clear that they never repeat never agreed to give up their constitutional liberties for the appearance of security Wyden said Were just going to keep fighting this battle Its going to be a long one Separately Feinstein said that James Clapper the Director of National Intelligence had agreed to provide her in writing with a statement about a Washington Post story that alleged the NSA had intercepted data in transmission between Google and Yahoo data centres She said she was withholding judgement on the story until she saw Clappers rebuttal Her strong endorsement of the domestic phone records collection indicates that the powerful Senate Democrat is not yet prepared to expand the criticism of the NSA that she has launched totally opposing its surveillance of foreign allied leaders a more traditional intelligence activity than bulk phone metadata surveillance Wyden would not comment on the Washington Post report on the Google and Yahoo intercepts But the senators suggested it had implications for the privacy of Americans communication Decades ago countries had their own kinds of communication systems Now that youve had the merger of global communications I think youre going to have a lot more challenges spying on foreigners with implications for US citizens Wyden said,The US Senate Intelligence Committee has approved a bill that

112,David Cameron has declared a clear result in the Scottish independence referendum after Scotland voted by a 106point margin against ending the 307yearold union with England and Wales The prime minister promised a devolution revolution across Great Britain including votes on English issues by English MPs at Westminster as he welcomed Scotlands decision to remain inside the UK There can be no disputes no reruns we have heard the settled will of the Scottish people Cameron said in a statement Earlier Scotlands rst minister Alex Salmond remained de ant at a downbeat Scottish National Party rally in Edinburgh saying he accepted Scotland had not at this stage decided to vote for independence He paid tribute to what he called a triumph for democratic politics and said he would work with Westminster in the best interests of Scotland and the rest of the UK warning the leaders of the three main parties to make good on their promises of enhanced devolution for Scotland We have touched sections of the community who have never before been touched by politics he said The yes campaign scored four big successes winning 53 of the vote in Scotlands largest city Glasgow 57 in Dundee and 51 in North Lanarkshire However the no camp was victorious in 28 authorities It won overwhelmingly in areas where it was expected to do well including Edinburgh Aberdeenshire and Borders but also in areas that could have gone to the yes campaign including the Western Isles In the nal count the no camp won 2001926 votes 553 to 1617989 for yes 447 In his speech Cameron made clear that the constitutional reforms including in Scotland would not be delivered until after the general election and that Scottish measures would proceed in tandem with changes in England We have heard the voice of Scotland and now the millions of voices of England must be heard he said Cameron added The people of Scotland have spoken and it is a clear result They have kept our country of four nations together and like millions of other people I am delighted As I said during the campaign it would have broken my heart to see our United Kingdom come to an end And I know that sentiment was shared by people not just across our country but around the world because of what we have achieved together in the past and what we can do together in the future So now it is time for our United Kingdom to come together and to move forward A vital part of that will be a balanced settlement fair to people in Scotland and importantly to everyone in England Wales and Northern Ireland as well Ed Miliband the Labour leader said the referendum was a vote from the Scottish people for change We know our country needs to change in the way it is governed and we know our country needs to change in who it is governed for We will deliver on stronger powers for a stronger Scottish parliament a strong Scotland But he said that would go beyond Scotland We will also meet the desire for change across England across Wales across the whole of the United Kingdom Nick Clegg the deputy prime minister said the referendum marks not only a new chapter for Scotland within the UK but also wider constitutional reform across the union Echoing the SNPs argument he said a vote against independence was clearly not a vote against change We must now deliver on time and in full the radical package of newly devolved powers to Scotland he added Yet that result raises the risk of further turmoil with MPs from Camerons Conservative Party threatening to revolt against the prime ministers late and potentially vital promise to quickly increase the Scottish parliaments powers while protecting its spending The UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage said Camerons offer of more devolution for England did not go far enough The English are 86 by population of this union Theyve been left out of all of this for the last 18 years We still have a situation where Scottish MPs can vote in the House of Commons on Englishonly issues I think what most English people want is a fair settlement he said Cameron and the Queen will both move to calm tensions when they deliver statements on the result The prime minister will try in the words of one cabinet minister to cement in the no vote by outlining how he will deliver the deepening of Scotlands devolution settlement including handing greater powers over tax and welfare to the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh The Queen who has monitored the referendum with interest will make a written statement It is understood that her remarks will focus on reconciliation The prime minister wants to move fast to show that the three main UK party leaders will live up to their commitments made during the referendum campaign to deliver what the former prime minister Gordon Brown called home rule within the UK Ministers believe it is important to move quickly to avoid a repeat of the 1980 referendum in Quebec The triumphalist behaviour of Ontario fuelled

you go totally mad said Maria a former heroin addict But it is cheap and it is easy to get and it is what everyone is doing This drug crisis has put Athenss health authorities already overwhelmed by draconian cuts under further strain The drug of preference for thousands of homeless Greeks forced on to the streets by poverty and despair shisha is described by both addicts and officials as a variant of crystal meth whose potential to send users into a state of mindless violence is underpinned by the substances with which the synthetic drug is frequently mixed battery acid engine oil and even shampoo Worse still it is not only readily available but easy to make tailormade for a society that sees little light at the end of the tunnel It is a killer but it also makes you want to kill said Konstantinos a drug addict You can kill without understanding that you have done it And it is spreading faster than death A lot of users have died For Charalampos Poulopoulos the head of Kethea Greeces preeminent antidrug centre shisha symbolizes the depredations of a crisis that has led to record levels of destitution and unemployment It is he said an austerity drug the response of dealers who have become ever more adept at producing synthetic drugs designed for those who can no longer afford more expensive highs from such drugs as heroin and cocaine The crisis has given dealers the possibility to promote a new cheap drug a cocaine for the poor said Poulopoulos at a centre run for addicts in Exarcheia the anarchist stronghold in Athens Shisha can be sniffed or injected and it can be made in home laboratories you dont need any specialized knowledge It is extremely dangerous Across Greece the byproducts of six straight years of recession have been brutal and cruel Depression along with drug and alcohol abuse has risen dramatically Delinquency and crime have soared as Greek society has unravelled under the weight of austerity measures that have cut the income of ordinary Greeks by 40 Prostitution the easiest way of financing drug addiction has similarly skyrocketed Desperation is such that many women agree to engage in unprotected sex because that way theyll make more money said Eleni Marini a Britishtrained psychologist with Kethea Shisha has been linked to a very intense sexual drive but it attacks your ability to think straight and were seeing a lot more pregnancies among drug addicts who engage in prostitution In 2012 two sex workers gave birth on the streets of Athens At a time when suicides have also shot up and the spread of HIV infections has assumed epidemic proportions drug addicts a population believed to be around 25000 strong have become increasingly selfdestructive And experts say young Greeks marginalized by record rates of unemployment at 64 Greece has the highest youth unemployment in the EU are leading the way The crisis has created a widespread sense of pessimism said Poulopoulos For those who might have quit drugs there is now no incentive Instead theres an atmosphere of misery where people knowing they wont find work are becoming a lot more selfdestructive In Athens where the economic crisis has hit hardest shisha is part of that Greeces conservativedominated coalition government has tried to deal with the problem by driving drug users and other homeless people out of the city centre a series of controversial police operations has swept central streets clearing crowded doorways and malls But with such actions authorities are only sweeping the problem under the carpet said Poulopoulos What in reality they are really doing is marginalizing these people even more by pushing them into the arms of drug dealers who offer them protection Just when the demand for help has never been greater statefunded organizations such as Kethea have had their budgets slashed by a third at the request of the troika the EC ECB and IMF keeping the debtstricken Greek economy afloat Since the outbreak of

32,Do you want your child to be good at sport make the school team and maybe one day even compete on the world stage Well try to ensure that your wouldbe Olympian or World Cup winner is born in November or failing that in October A study led by one of the UKs leading experts on childrens physical activity has found that school pupils born in those months are tter than everyone else in their class November and Octoberborn children emerged as tter stronger and more powerful than their peers born in the other ten months of the year especially those whose birthdays fell in April or June Dr Gavin Sandercock from the Centre for Sports and Exercise Science at Essex University and colleagues found that autumnborn children enjoyed a clear physical advantage over their classmates The research involved 8550 boys and girls aged between ten and 16 from 26 state schools in Essex All were tested between 2007 and 2010 on three different measures of tness stamina handgrip strength and lowerbody power The results revealed that a childs month of birth could make signi cant differences to their levels of cardiovascular tness muscle strength and ability to accelerate all of which predict how good someone is at sport in which such attributes are vital Performances at school sports days in the weeks ahead may bear out the ndings Novemberborn children were the ttest overall as they had the most stamina and power and were the second strongest Those born in October were almost as t scoring highest for strength and coming third for power with December children close behind The gap in physical prowess between children in the same class but born in different months was sometimes very wide For example we found that a boy born in November can run at least 10 faster jump 12 higher and is 15 more powerful than a child of the same age born in April This is potentially a huge physical advantage said Sandercock Such gaps could ultimately decide who became a toplevel athlete because as the paper says selection into elite sports may often depend on very small margins or differences in an individuals physical performance The study which has been published in the International Journal of Sports Medicine found that when scores for the three kinds of tness were combined those born in April were the least t then those in June That could see those children excluded from school teams and becoming sporting underachievers Sandercock said The ndings seem to show that children born in the early months of the school year enjoy a double autumn advantage they are already known to have an academic advantage and now they also appear to be better equipped for sport too The results show that something other than the relativeage effect the greater maturity of those born early in the school year is at work especially as the ttest children were not the tallest or heaviest he added The authors believe that autumnborn childrens greater exposure over the summer months towards the end of pregnancy to vitamin D the sunshine vitamin linked to a range of health bene ts is the most likely explanation Seasonal differences in intrauterine vitamin D concentrations seem most plausible they say John Steele chief executive of the Youth Sport Trust said the quality of a young persons introduction to PE and sport at school can be a major factor in their sporting development Children that get a highquality rst experience which develops their physical literacy are those that will have greater agility balance and coordination and are more likely to develop an enjoyment of physical activity and excel in sport as they grow up he said UK Sport could not say if a disproportionately high number of the 1300 athletes across 47 sports it funds were born in November and October Natalie Dunman its head of performance pathways said that while the differences highlighted in the new ndings were borne out by teenagers competing in juniorlevel competitions they had disappeared by the time sportspeople were taking part in adult competitions She said Looking at elite senior athletes there are many factors that go into making a champion and our work hasnt uncovered anything to suggest that month of birth is one of the key ingredients,Do you want your child to be good at sport play for the school team and maybe one day even compete in international competitions Well try to make sure that your future Olympian or World Cup winner is born in November or October A study by one of the UKs leading experts on childrens physical activity has found that school pupils born in those months are tter than everyone else in their class November and Octoberborn children were tter stronger and more powerful than those born in the other ten months of the year especially those whose birthdays were in April or June Dr Gavin Sandercock of Essex University and colleagues found that autumnborn children had a clear physical advantage over their classmates The research involved 8550 boys and girls aged between ten and 16 from 26 state schools in Essex All were tested between 2007 and 2010 on three different measures of tness stamina handgrip strength and lowerbody power The results revealed that a childs month of birth could make signi cant differences to their levels of cardiovascular tness muscle strength and ability to accelerate all of which predict how good someone is at sport Novemberborn children were the ttest overall as they had the most stamina and power and were the second strongest Those born in October were almost as t scoring highest for strength and coming third for power with December children close behind The gap in physical ability between children in the same class but born in different months was sometimes very wide For example we found that a boy born in November can run at least 10 faster jump 12 higher and is 15 more powerful than a child of the same age born in April This is potentially a huge physical advantage said Sandercock Such gaps could decide who became a toplevel athlete because as the paper says selection into elite sports may often depend on very small margins or differences in an individuals physical performance The study which has been published in the International Journal of Sports Medicine found that when scores for the three kinds of tness were combined those born in April were the least t then those in June That could see those children excluded from school teams and becoming sporting underachievers Sandercock said The ndings seem to show that children born in the early months of the school year enjoy a double autumn advantage they are already known to have an academic advantage and now they also appear to be better equipped for sport too The results show that something other than the relativeage effect the greater maturity of those born early in the school year is the cause especially as the ttest children were not the tallest or heaviest he added The authors believe that autumnborn childrens greater exposure over the summer months towards the end of pregnancy to vitamin D is the most likely explanation Seasonal differences in vitamin D concentrations in the womb seem most plausible they say John Steele chief executive of the Youth Sport Trust said the quality of a young persons introduction to sport at school can be a major factor in their sporting development Children that get a highquality rst experience are those that will have greater agility balance and coordination and are more likely to develop an enjoyment of physical activity and excel in sport as they grow up he said

15,Margaret Thatcher the most dominant British prime minister since Winston Churchill in 1940 and a global champion of the late 20thcentury free market economic revival has died The British government announced that she would receive a ceremonial funeral with military honours at St Pauls Cathedral The British prime minister David Cameron who is cutting short his trip to Europe to return to London following the news said It was with great sadness that l learned of Lady Thatchers death Weve lost a great leader a great prime minister and a great Briton He added As our first woman prime minister Margaret Thatcher succeeded against all the odds and the real thing about Margaret Thatcher is that she didnt just lead our country she saved our country and I believe she will go down as the greatest British peacetime prime minister In a statement President Barack Obama said Here in America many of us will never forget her standing shoulder to shoulder with President Reagan reminding the world that we are not simply carried along by the currents of history we can shape them with moral conviction unyielding courage and iron will The first woman elected to lead a major western state Lady Thatcher as she became after the longest premiership since 1827 served 11 unbroken years at No 10 Downing Street Thatcher who was 87 had been in declining health for some years suffering from dementia After a series of ministrokes in 2002 Thatcher withdrew from public life no longer able to make the kind of waspish pronouncements that had been her forte in office and beyond Her death was greeted with tributes from across the political spectrum As Labour sources announced the party would suspend campaigning in local elections as a mark of respect its leader Ed Miliband said She will be remembered as a unique figure She reshaped the politics of a whole generation She was Britains first woman prime minister She moved the centre ground of British politics and was a huge figure on the world stage The Labour Party disagreed with much of what she did and she will always remain a controversial figure But we can disagree and also greatly respect her political achievements and her personal strength The deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said Margaret Thatcher was one of the defining figures in modern British politics Whatever side of the political debate you stand on no one can deny that as prime minister she left a unique and lasting imprint on the country she served Describing her as a political phenomenon the former Tory prime minister Sir John Major said Her outstanding characteristics will always be remembered by those who worked closely with her courage and determination in politics and humanity and generosity of spirit in private The Iron Lady proved a significant cold war ally of the US president Ronald Reagan in the final showdown with the Soviet Union which broke up under reformist pressures led by Mikhail Gorbachev a Kremlin leader with whom Thatcher famously declared she could do business As a result many ordinary voters in exSoviet bloc states saw her as a bold champion of their liberty a view widely shared across the spectrum of mainstream US opinion though not at home or among key EU partners Thatcher was an unremarkable midranking Conservative until she unexpectedly became party leader in 1975 Within a decade she had become known around the world both admired and detested for her promarket domestic reforms and her implacable attitudes in foreign policy including her longrunning battle with the IRA which almost managed to murder her when it placed a bomb in the Grand Hotel Brighton in 1984 At home the emerging doctrine of Thatcherism meant denationalization of stateowned industry the new word privatization came into widespread use in many countries and defeat of militant trade unionists notably the National Union of Miners whose yearlong strike 1984 85 was bitter and traumatic Boosted by the newly arrived revenues from Britains North Sea oil fields Thatcher had room to manoeuvre and change the ageing industrial economy and she used the opportunity to defeat her enemies including moderate members of her own party But she also deployed her notorious handbaggings or verbal attacks in the European Union to obtain a British rebate my money as she called it She was less successful in fending off the centralizing ambitions of the Belgian Empire her description of the European Commission especially in the years when it was headed by the French socialist Jacques Delors Her allies in the tabloid press egged her on And as the British economy recovered from the severe recession that her monetarist medicine had inflicted on it to tame the unions and cure inflation she briefly seemed invincible But untrammelled power with the defeat or retirement of allies who had kept her in check led to mistakes and growing unpopularity When Sir Geoffrey Howe nominally her deputy finally fell out with Thatcher chiefly over Europe his devastating resignation speech triggered a leadership challenge Thatcher made way for John Major rather than risk losing to him in a ballot In retirement she wrote highly successful memoirs

189,Sweden is the best country for older people Afghanistan the worst but general affluence does not necessarily mean better conditions for the over60s according to the first global index on ageing While Swedens top ranking followed by Norway Germany the Netherlands and Canada may be predictable the Global AgeWatch index throws up some surprising results The US the worlds richest country is down in eighth place while the UK fails to make the top ten at number 13 Sri Lanka ranks 36 well above Pakistan at 89 despite similar levels of gross domestic product GDP Bolivia and Mauritius score higher than the size of their economies may suggest while the emerging economies of Brazil Russia India and China are a mixed bag Brazil and China rank relatively high on the index India and Russia are much lower This survey shows that history counts said Mark Gorman director of the HelpAge International advocacy group The topranked countries are what you would expect but Scandinavian countries were not wealthy when they introduced universal pensions The older population in Sri Lanka today is benefiting from good basic education and health care those countries made certain policy choices Everybody faces scarce resources but they should not forget that when they make investment decisions they should also address issues of old age The index developed with the UN Fund for Population and Development spans 91 countries and 89 of the worlds older people The survey comes amid a major demographic shift by 2050 there are expected to be two billion people aged 60 and over who will comprise more than a fifth of the worlds population Population ageing when older people account for an increasingly large proportion of people is happening fastest in developing countries More than twothirds of older people live in poor countries by 2050 this proportion is expected to be about fourfifths While it took 115 years for the older population of France to double from 7 to 14 between 1865 and 1980 Brazil is likely to make the same shift between 2011 and 2032 in just 21 years The index shows that the fastest ageing countries Jordan Laos Mongolia Nicaragua and Vietnam where the number of older people is predicted to more than triple by 2050 fall into the lower half of the ranking suggesting that policymakers need to tackle ageing headon if they are to adequately support their populations There are gender differences among ageing populations with women generally outliving men In 2012 for every 84 men aged 60 and over there were 100 women Lack of paid work hence savings less decisionmaking power in the family and vulnerability to violence contribute towards the disadvantage many women face in old age However if appropriate measures are implemented population ageing does not inevitably lead to significantly higher health care spending according to the report which highlights the importance of longterm investments in education and health care for older people Bolivia ranked 46 despite being one of the poorest countries has introduced progressive policies for older people with a national plan on ageing free health care and a noncontributory universal pension Nepal ranked 77 introduced a basic pension in 1995 for people over the age of 70 without other pension income Though limited in value and eligibility and with uneven coverage it is an example of how a poor country has chosen to make a start in addressing poverty in old age Good basic health care introduced decades ago in Chile and Costa Rica has served the ageing populations of those countries A good education system basic literacy is crucial for older people as they deal with the pensions bureaucracy is of great benefit later in life In the Philippines older people have benefited from the educational reforms introduced after independence in 1946 which made elementary and high school education compulsory The same is true for Armenia which like other countries of the former Soviet Union benefited from a robust education system South Korea a surprisingly low 67 on the ageing index performed worse than similar countries on a GDPperhead basis partly because it introduced a pension only recently The ageing index is calculated using 13 indicators under four headings income security health care employment and education and an enabling environment All indicators have equal weight except for pension income coverage life expectancy at 60 healthy life expectancy at 60 and psychological wellbeing These categories were given increased weighting because of better data quality and countries

140,Writing in the journal Nature former president of the Royal Institute of Navigation Roger McKinlay argues that our reliance on GPS global positioning system technology is misplaced and could be eroding our innate way nding abilities If we do not cherish them our natural navigation abilities will deteriorate as we rely ever more on smart devices he wrote McKinlay believes huge investment will be needed before navigation systems will be good enough to allow technologies such as autonomous vehicles to take off In the meantime he argues we need better research into systems for navigation while children should be encouraged to learn how to nd their way around by more traditional means Schools should teach navigation and map reading as life skills he wrote According to Ofcom the Of ce of Communications around 66 of adults in the UK owned a smartphone in 2015 up from 39 in 2012 making GPS technology widely available But McKinlay a satellite communication and navigation consultant believes that we should be wary of leaving our navigational needs to our devices Navigation is a useitorloseit skill he wrote While few scienti c studies have explored the issue research from 2009 supports the notion What we did was to look at a set of current London taxi drivers and a set of London taxi drivers that had been retired for about four years said neuroscientist Dr Hugo Spiers head of the Spatial Cognition Group at University College London who is an author of the study The results showed that the retired taxi drivers performed worse on navigation tests than those still behind the wheel We were able to show that their abilities did drop away if they werent using their knowledge on that particular test Spiers also believes there is a danger in relying on technologies like GPS but he is quick to point out that the biggest risk lies in users being unwittingly led into perilous situations Among the fatalities blamed on satnavs satellite navigation devices was the death of a driver who in 2010 plunged into a reservoir in Spain There is a genuine potential for risk in relying on a satnav said Spiers But the actual health risk of not using your brain effectively is not known The way in which navigational technology is used could also affect its impact on our own abilities says Spiers While audio instructions to drivers remove the need to think about navigation he says the use of smartphone apps as digital maps is very different In the old days you had to print out or take an A to Z map in your pocket what we are doing now is just using computer aided information and you are having to think really quite hard about where you are going and interact with this device he said The modern technology isnt just dumbing us down completely McKinlay remains convinced that navigation technologies have a long way to go before futuristic scenarios involving driverless cars and smart cities become a reality For really critical applications safety applications like landing aircraft or navigating aircraft GPS is still not good enough he said Though Spiers believes the development of arti cial intelligence based on machine learning could lead to a new wave of navigational aids McKinlay remains sceptical We will see ever smarter machines which are very very task speci c but the big breakthrough will be when they are able to tune in to what you might be thinking and what you might be wanting to achieve he said Ultimately McKinlay believes its essential that humans remain able to take control of their navigation Do you really want to encourage people to get to a point where when it disappears or when the battery goes at they are in total shock and can do nothing he said Technology isnt magic it is just a tool,Former president of

147,Scientists have implanted a false memory in the brains of mice in an experiment that they hope will shed light on the welldocumented phenomenon whereby people remember events or experiences that have never happened False memories are a major problem with witness statements in courts of law Defendants have often been convicted of offences based on eyewitness testimony only to have their convictions later overturned when DNA or some other corroborating evidence is brought to bear form in the human brain Susumu Tonagawa a neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT and his team encoded memories in the brains of mice by manipulating individual neurons Memories of experiences we have had are made from several elements including records of objects space and time These records called engrams are encoded in physical and chemical changes in brain cells and the connections between them According to Tonagawa both false and genuine memories seem to rely on the same brain mechanisms In their work Tonagawas team used a technique known as optogenetics which allows the fine control of individual brain cells They engineered brain cells in the mouse hippocampus a part of the brain known to be involved in forming memories to express the gene for a protein called channelrhodopsin When cells that contain channelrhodopsin are exposed to blue light they become activated The researchers also modified the hippocampus cells so that the channelrhodopsin protein would be produced in whichever brain cells the mouse was using to encode its memory engrams In the experiment Tonagawas team placed the mice in a chamber and allowed them to explore it As they did so relevant memoryencoding brain cells were producing the channelrhodopsin protein The next day the same mice were placed in a second chamber and given a small electric shock to encode a fear response At the same time the researchers shone light into the mouse brains to activate their memories of the first chamber That way the mice learned to associate fear of the electric shock with the memory of the first chamber In the final part of the experiment the team placed the mice back in the first chamber The mice froze demonstrating a typical fear response even though they had never been shocked while there We call this incepting or implanting false memories in a mouse brain Tonagawa told Science A similar process may occur when powerful false memories are created in humans Humans are very imaginative animals said Tonagawa Independent of what is happening around you in the outside world humans constantly have internal activity in the brain So just like our mouse it is quite possible we can associate what we happen to have in our mind with bad or good highvariance ongoing events In other words there could be a false association of what you have in your mind rather than what is happening to you He added Our study showed that the false memory and the genuine memory are based on very similar almost identical brain mechanisms It is difficult for the false memory bearer to distinguish between them We hope our future findings along this line will further alert legislatures and legal experts to how unreliable memory can be Chris French head of the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit at Goldsmiths University of London is a leading researcher in false memories in people He said that the latest results were an important first step in understanding their neural basis Memory researchers have always recognized that memory does not as is often assumed work like a video camera faithfully recording all of the details of anything we experience Instead it is a reconstructive process which involves building a specific memory from fragments of real memory traces of the original event but also possibly including information from other sources He cautioned that the false memories created in the mice in the experiments were far simpler than the complex false memories that have generated controversy within psychology and psychiatry for example false memories of childhood sexual abuse or even memories for bizarre ritualized satanic abuse abduction by aliens or past lives Such rich false memories will clearly involve many brain systems and we are still a long way from understanding the processes involved in their formation at the neuronal level said Professor French Mark Stokes a neuroscientist at Oxford University said the experiments were a tour de force but that it was important to put them into perspective Although the results seem to imply that new memories were formed by the artificial stimulation rather than the actual environment this kind of phenomenon is still a long way from most peoples idea of memory he said Rather he said it was equivalent to implanting an association that perhaps someone cannot place but that makes them wary of a specific environment for no apparent reason It is unlikely that this kind of pairing could lead to the rich set of associations related to normal memories although it is possible that over time such pairing could be integrated with other memories to construct a more elaborate false narrative The mouse models created by the MIT team will help scientists ask ever more complex questions about memories in people Now that we can reactivate and change the contents of memories in the brain we can begin asking questions that were once the realm of philosophy said Steve Ramirez a colleague of Tonagawas at MIT Are there multiple conditions that lead to the formation of false memories Can false memories be artificially created What about false memories for more than just contexts false memories for objects food or other mice These are the once seemingly scifi questions that can now be experimentally tackled in the lab As the technology develops said French scientists need to think about its uses carefully Whatever means are used to implant false memories we need to be very aware of the ethical issues raised by such procedures the potential for abuse of such techniques cannot be overstated,Scientists have implanted a false memory in the brains of mice in an experiment that they hope will

activate their memories of the first box That way the mice learned to associate fear of the electric shock with the memory of the first box In the final part of the experiment the team put the mice

160,The forests and suburbs of Europe are echoing with the growls howls and silent padding of large predators according to a new study that shows that brown bears wolves and lynx are thriving on a crowded continent Despite fears that large carnivores are doomed to extinction because of rising human populations and overconsumption a study published in Science has found that largepredator populations are stable or rising in Europe Brown bears wolves the Eurasian lynx and wolverines are found in nearly onethird of mainland Europe excluding Belarus Ukraine and Russia with most individuals living outside nature reserves indicating that changing attitudes and landscapescale conservation measures are successfully protecting species that have suffered massive persecution throughout human history Bears are the most abundant large carnivore in Europe with around 17000 individuals alongside 12000 wolves 9000 Eurasian lynx and 1250 wolverines which are restricted to northern parts of Scandinavia and Finland Only Belgium Denmark the Netherlands and Luxembourg in mainland Europe like Britain have no breeding populations of at least one large carnivore species But the papers lead author and other conservationists said these animals surprising distribution across wellpopulated regions of Europe showed that even the British countryside could support big predators Guillaume Chapron from Swedens University of Agricultural Sciences and researchers across Europe found wolves in some cases living in suburban areas alongside up to 3050 people per square kilometre higher than the population density of Cambridge or Newcastle On average in Europe wolves live on land with a population density of 37 people per sq km lynx in areas with a population density of 21 people per sq km and bears among 19 people per sq km The population density of the Scottish Highlands is nine people per sq km In order to have wolves we dont need to remove people from the landscape said Chapron According to Chapron and his colleagues the bigcarnivore revival shows the success of a landsharing model of conservation in stark contrast to keeping predators and people apart by fencing off wilderness areas as occurs in North America and Africa Im not saying its a peaceandlove story coexistence often means conflict but its important to manage that conflict keep it at a low level and resolve the problems it causes Wolves can be difficult neighbours said Chapron We shouldnt be talking about peoplepredator conflict we have conflict between people about predators These animals are symbolic of difficult questions about how we should use the land According to the researchers this landsharing approach could be applied elsewhere in the world The reasons for its success in Europe include political stability burgeoning populations of prey species such as wild deer and financial support for nonlethal livestock protection such as electric fences which mean that farmers do not resort to shooting wild predators Most crucial said Chapron has been the EU Habitats Directive which has compelled member states to protect and revive rare species Without the Habitats Directive I dont think we would have had this recovery he said It shows if people are willing to protect nature and if political will is translated into strong legislation like the Habitats Directive its possible to achieve results in wildlife protection The revival was welcomed by author and commentator George Monbiot who is launching Rewilding Britain a new charity to encourage the return of wild landscape and extinct species It is great to see the upward trend continuing but Britain is completely anomalous weve lost more of our large mammals than any country except for Ireland he said Apart from the accidental reintroduction of boar weve done almost nothing whereas in much of the rest of Europe weve got bears lynx and wolves coming back Its a massive turnaround from the centuries of persecution The survey found the Eurasian lynx living permanently in 11 population groups across 23 European countries of which only five were native populations indicating the success of reintroduction efforts According to Monbiot momentum is building for the reintroduction of the lynx into the Cairngorms in Scotland If it works in the rest of Europe theres absolutely no reason why it cant work in the UK he said pointing out that bears and wolves are found within an hour of Rome Theres no demographic reason why we cant have a similar return of wildlife in the UK,The forests and suburbs of Europe are echoing with the growls and howls of large predators according to a new study The study shows that brown bears wolves and lynx are thriving on the crowded continent Rising human populations and overconsumption make many people believe that such animals will soon become extinct But the study has found that largepredator populations are stable or rising in Europe Brown bears wolves and the Eurasian lynx are found in nearly onethird of mainland Europe excluding Belarus Ukraine and Russia with most living outside nature reserves This indicates that changing attitudes and conservation measures are successfully protecting species that have suffered massive persecution throughout human history Bears are the most abundant large carnivore in Europe there are around 17000 of them There are 12000 wolves and 9000 Eurasian lynx Only Belgium Denmark the Netherlands and Luxembourg in mainland Europe like Britain have no breeding populations of at least one large carnivore species But the studys main author and other conservationists said that these animals now live in wellpopulated regions of Europe so even the British countryside could support big predators Guillaume Chapron from Swedens University of Agricultural Sciences and researchers across Europe found wolves in some cases living in suburban areas alongside up to 3050 people per square kilometre On average in Europe wolves live on land with a population density of 37 people per sq km lynx in areas with a population density of 21 people per sq km and bears among 19 people per sq km The population density of the Scottish Highlands is just nine people per sq km In order to have wolves we dont need to remove people from the landscape said Chapron He adds that the bigcarnivore revival shows the success of a landsharing model of conservation unlike the policy of keeping predators and people apart by fencing off wilderness areas as occurs in North America and Africa Im not saying its a peaceandlove story

184,The vast fortunes made by the worlds richest 100 billionaires are driving up inequality and hindering the worlds ability to tackle poverty according to Oxfam The charity said the accumulation of wealth and income on an unprecedented scale often at the expense of secure jobs and decent wages for the poorest undermined the ability of people who survive on aid or low wages to improve their situation and escape poverty Oxfam said the worlds poorest could be lifted out of poverty several times over if the richest 100 billionaires would give away the money they made in 2012 Without pointing a finger at individuals the charity argued that the 240bn net income amassed in 2012 by the richest 100 billionaires would be enough to make extreme poverty history four times over It is rare for charities to attack the wealthy who are usually regarded as a source of funding Bill Gates and Warren Buffett are among a group of 40 US billionaires who have pledged much of their wealth to aid projects but there is little detail about the level of their annual donations Their actions have also not been matched by Russian Middle Eastern or Chinese billionaires In the report The Cost of Inequality How Wealth and Income Extremes Hurt Us All published just before the World Economic Forum in Davos the charity calls on world leaders to curb income extremes and commit to reducing inequality to at least 1990 levels The report found that the richest 1 had increased their incomes by 60 in the past 20 years with the financial crisis accelerating rather than slowing the process Barbara Stocking Oxfams Chief Executive said extreme wealth was economically inefficient politically corrosive socially divisive and environmentally destructive She said studies show that countries suffer low levels of investment and growth as workers are forced to survive on a smaller share of total incomes She said We can no longer pretend that the creation of wealth for a few will inevitably benefit the many too often the reverse is true The report said the issue affected all parts of the world In the UK inequality is rapidly returning to levels not seen since the time of Charles Dickens the nineteenthcentury novelist In China the top 10 now take home nearly 60 of the income Chinese inequality levels are now similar to those in South Africa which is now the most unequal country on Earth and significantly more unequal than at the end of apartheid In the US the share of national income going to the top 1 has doubled since 1980 from 10 to 20 the report says For the top 001 the share of national income is above levels last seen in the 1920s The World Bank and International Monetary Fund have argued that extreme income inequality undermines growth and both organizations have attempted to tie their loans to programmes that limit the growth of inequality Members of the richest 1 are estimated to use as much as 10000 times more carbon than the average US citizen Oxfam said world leaders should learn from countries such as Brazil which has grown rapidly while reducing inequality Stocking said We need a global new deal to reverse decades of increasing inequality As a first step world leaders should formally commit themselves to reducing inequality to the levels seen in 1990 She said closing tax havens which the Tax Justice Network says hold as much as 31 trillion or as much as a third of all global wealth could yield 189bn in additional tax revenues,The huge fortunes made by the worlds richest 100 billionaires are increasing inequality and hindering the worlds

127,A few months before he died Carl Sagan recorded a message of hope to wouldbe Mars explorers telling them Whatever the reason youre on Mars is Im glad youre there And I wish I was with you Seventeen years after the pioneering astronomer set out his hopeful vision of the future in 1996 a company from the Netherlands is proposing to turn Sagans dreams of reaching Mars into reality The company Mars One plans to send four astronauts on a trip to the Red Planet to set up a human colony in 2023 But there are a couple of serious snags Firstly when on Mars their bodies will have to adapt to surface gravity that is 38 of that on Earth It is thought that this would cause such a total physiological change in their bone density muscle strength and circulation that voyagers would no longer be able to survive in Earths conditions Secondly and directly related to the first they will have to say goodbye to all their family and friends as the deal doesnt include a return ticket The Mars One website states that a return cannot be anticipated nor expected To return they would need a fully assembled and fuelled rocket capable of escaping the gravitational field of Mars onboard life support systems capable of up to a sevenmonth voyage and the capacity either to dock with a space station orbiting Earth or perform a safe reentry and landing Not one of these is a small endeavour the site notes requiring substantial technical capacity weight and cost Nevertheless the project has already had 10000 applicants according to the companys Medical Director Norbert Kraft He told The Guardian that the applicants so far ranged in age from 18 to at least 62 and though they include women they tended to be men The reasons they gave for wanting to go were varied he said An American woman called Cynthia who gave her age as 32 told the company that it was a childhood imagining of hers to go to Mars She described a trip her mother had taken her on in the early 1990s to a lecture at the University of Wisconsin She said the lecturer had been Sagan and she had asked him if he thought humans would land on Mars in her lifetime Cynthia said He in turn asked me if I wanted to be trapped in a tin can spacecraft for the two years it would take to get there I told him yes he smiled and told me in all seriousness that yes he absolutely believed that humans would reach Mars in my lifetime She told the project When I first heard about the Mars One project I thought this is my chance that childhood dream could become a reality I could be one of the pioneers building the first settlement on Mars and teaching people back home that there are still uncharted territories that humans can reach for The prime attributes Mars One is looking for in astronautsettlers are resilience adaptability curiosity ability to trust and resourcefulness according to Kraft They must also be over 18 Founded in 2010 by Bas Lansdorp an engineer Mars One says it has developed a realistic road map and financing plan for the project based on existing technologies and that the mission is perfectly feasible The website states that the basic elements required for life are already present on the planet For instance water can be extracted from ice in the soil and Mars has sources of nitrogen the primary element in the air we breathe The colony will be powered by specially adapted solar panels it says Mars One said it had signed a contract with the American firm Paragon Space Development Corporation to take the first steps in developing the life support system and spacesuits fit for the mission The project will cost a reported 6bn a sum Lansdorp has said he hopes will be met partly by selling broadcasting rights The broadcasting revenue from the London Olympics was almost enough to finance a mission to Mars Lansdorp said in an interview with ABC News Another ambassador to the project is Paul Rmer the cocreator of Big Brother one of the first and most successful reality TV shows On the website Rmer gave an indication of how the broadcasting of the project might proceed This mission to Mars could be the biggest media event in the world said Rmer Reality meets talent show with no ending and the whole world watching The aim is to establish a permanent human colony according to the companys website The first team would land on the surface of Mars in 2023 to begin constructing the colony with a team of four astronauts every two years after that The project is not without its sceptics however and concerns have been raised about how astronauts might get to the planet and establish a colony with all the life support and other requirements needed Professor Gerard t Hooft winner of the Nobel Prize for theoretical physics in 1999 is an ambassador for the project T Hooft admits there are unknown health risks The radiation is of quite a different nature from anything that has been tested on Earth he said The mission hopes to inspire generations to believe that all things are possible that anything can be achieved much like the Apollo Moon landings Mars One believes it is not only possible but imperative that we establish a permanent settlement on Mars in order to accelerate our understanding of the formation of the solar system the origins of life and of equal importance our place in the universe it says,A company from the Netherlands is trying to turn

51,Until the last David Bowie who has died of cancer was still capable of springing surprises His latest album Blackstar appeared on his 69th birthday on 8 January 2016 and proved that his gift for making dramatic statements as well as challenging disturbing music hadnt deserted him Throughout the 1970s Bowie was a trailblazer of musical trends and pop fashion Having been a late60s mime and cabaret entertainer he evolved into a singersongwriter a pioneer of glamrock then veered into what he called plastic soul before moving to Berlin to create innovative electronic music His capacity for mixing brilliant changes of sound and image underpinned by a genuine intellectual curiosity is rivalled by few in pop history Bowie was born David Robert Jones in south London In 1953 the family moved to Kent where David showed aptitude in singing and playing the recorder Later he studied art music and design In 1961 Davids mother bought him a plastic saxophone introducing him to an instrument which would become a recurring ingredient in his music At 15 David formed his first band the Konrads It was clear that Davids talents and ambition dictated that he should go solo David adopted the name Bowie to avoid confusion with Davy Jones of the Monkees Bowies first album released in June 1967 was titled simply David Bowie In July 1969 Bowie released Space Oddity the song that would give him his initial commercial breakthrough Timed to coincide with the Apollo 11 moon landing it was a top five UK hit In March 1970 Bowie married art student Angela Barnett Artistically Bowie was powering ahead The Man Who Sold the World was released in the US in late 1970 and in the UK the following year and with its daring songwriting and broody hardrock sound it was the first album to do full justice to his writing and performing gifts The albums themes included immortality insanity murder and mysticism evidence that Bowie was a songwriter who was thinking way beyond pops usual boundaries He followed it with 1972s Hunky Dory a mix of wordy elaborate songwriting It was an excellent collection that met with only moderate success but that all changed with The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars later that year This time Bowie emerged as a fully fledged sciencefiction character an intergalactic glamrock star visiting a doomed planet Earth and the album effectively wrote the script for his own stardom The hit single Starman brought instant success for the album while Bowies ravishing stage costumes and provocative performances triggered fan enthusiasm unseen since Beatlemania Everything Bowie touched turned to gold He had his first UK number 1 album with Aladdin Sane 1973 which generated the hit singles The Jean Genie and Drivein Saturday But Bowie was already planning fresh career moves His increasing interest in funk and soul music came to the fore on the deliciously listenable Young Americans 1975 which gave him a US charttopper with Fame featuring John Lennon as a guest vocalist Station to Station 1976 introduced a new persona the Thin White Duke which Bowie had carried over from his headlining performance as a melancholy space traveller in Nicolas Roegs film The Man Who Fell to Earth Bowies relationship with his wife had been disintegrating under the pressures of success and the couple divorced in 1980 This was a year of further creative triumph bringing a fine album Scary Monsters and Super Creeps and its spinoff charttopping single Ashes to Ashes followed by Bowies wellreceived stint as John Merrick in The Elephant Man on the Broadway stage He achieved a number 1 single with his 1981 partnership with Queen Under Pressure while becoming increasingly involved in crossovers between different media He appeared in the German movie Christiane F 1981 and wrote music for the soundtrack He had another chart hit with Cat People Putting Out Fire from Paul Schraders movie Cat People 1982 Bowie continued to make progress as a screen actor with appearances in The Hunger and the second world war drama Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence both released in 1983 Musically this was the year in which he put his energy into an allout commercial onslaught with the album Lets Dance and followup concerts Lets Dance moulded Bowie into a crowdfriendly global rock star with the album and its singles Lets Dance China Girl and Modern Love all becoming huge international hits This was the heyday of MTV and Bowies knack for eyecatching videos fuelled this commercial splurge while the sixmonth Serious Moonlight tour drew massive crowds It was to be the most commercially successful period of his career His profile gained another boost from his appearance at the 1985 Live Aid famine relief concert at Wembley Stadium where he was one of the standout performers In addition he teamed up with Mick Jagger to record the fundraising single Dancing in the Street which sped to number 1 A few days after his appearance at the Freddie Mercury tribute concert at Wembley Stadium in April 1992 Bowie married the Somalian model Iman and the couple bought a home in New York This new start in his private life coincided with a search for fresh musical inspiration For the album Black Tie White Noise 1993 he sprinkled elements of soul electronica and hip hop into the mix It topped the UK album chart and yielded a top 10 single Jump They Say New media and technology influenced his recordings too His 1999 album Hours was based around music he had written for a computer game called Omikron in which Bowie and Iman appeared as characters The birth of Bowie and Imans daughter Alexandria followed in August 2000 As an adopted New Yorker Bowie was the opening act at the Concert for New York City in October 2001 where he joined Paul McCartney Jon Bon Jovi Billy Joel the Who and Elton John in a benefit show six weeks after the 911 attacks Bowie was back in the studio the following year for Reality However in the midst of his Reality tour in 2004 Bowie was stricken with chest pains while performing in Germany and underwent emergency surgery in Hamburg to clear a blocked artery He took the medical emergency as a warning and reduced the pace of his activities In 2006 he announced he would be taking a year off from touring and recording In February that year he was given a Grammy lifetime achievement award having been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 The Next Day 2013 was his first album of new material in a decade It contained the single Where Are We Now which gave him his first UK top 10 hit since 1993 The album topped charts in Britain and around the world In 2014 Bowie was given the Brit Award for Best British Male making him the oldest British recipient in the awards history He is survived by Iman their daughter Alexandria his stepdaughter Zulekha and his son Duncan from his first marriage,Until the end David Bowie who has died of cancer was still full of surprises His

79,Vienna is the worlds best city to live in Baghdad is the worst and London Paris and New York do not even make it into the top 35 according to international research into quality of life Germanspeaking cities dominate the rankings in the 18th Mercer Quality of Life study with Vienna joined by Zurich Munich Dusseldorf and Frankfurt in the top seven Paris has tumbled down the league falling ten places to 37th just ahead of London at 39th almost entirely because of the citys vulnerability to terrorist attacks The study examined social and economic conditions health education housing and the environment and is used by big companies to assess where they should locate and how much they should pay staff Vienneseborn Helena Hartlauer 32 said she was not surprised at her citys top position The municipalitys social democratic government has a long tradition of investing in highquality social housing making Vienna almost uniquely affordable among major cities I live in a 100sqmetre turnofthecentury apartment in a good area about 20 minutes walk from the city centre But my rent is just 800 625 a month An equivalent apartment in London would cost upwards of 2000 and even more in New York ranked 44th in the table US cities perform relatively poorly in the study largely because of issues around personal safety and crime The highest ranking city in the US is San Francisco at 28th Boston is 34th Canadian cities led by Vancouver far outrank their US rivals in the table You dont realize how safe Vienna is until you head abroad said Hartlauer We also have terri c public transport with the underground working 24 hours at weekends and it only costs 1 per trip Vienna bene ted enormously from the fall of the Berlin Wall becoming the gateway to Eastern European countries that often have historic ties to the former AustroHungarian empire Our big USP is our geographical location said Martin Eichtinger Austrian ambassdaor to London who lived in Vienna for 20 years The fall of the Berlin Wall helped de ne Vienna as the hub for companies wanting to do business in Central Europe According to the World Bank Austria has one of the highest gures for GDP per head in the world just behind the US and ahead of Germany and Britain although quite some way below neighbouring Switzerland Zurich in Switzerland is named by Mercer as having the worlds second highest quality of life but the Viennese say their city is far more fun There are more students in Vienna than any other Germanspeaking city said Hartlauer Its a very fast growing young and lively city she added though she conceded she works for the citys tourist board Vienna has long been overlooked by British weekend city break tourists who instead ock to Barcelona or Berlin and tend to think of Austria as somewhere for skiing lakes and mountains But after an increase in budget ights from regional British cities such as Manchester and Edinburgh Vienna is fast catching up as a popular destination In 2015 there were 588000 British visitors to Vienna up 18 on the year before The ow is both ways Eichtinger said London has become the number one city destination for Austrian visitors Vienna has ranked top in the last seven published rankings said Mercer It scores highly in a number of categories it provides a safe and stable environment to live in a high level of public utilities and transport facilities and good recreational facilities The European migrant crisis which has seen large numbers of refugees and asylum seekers pass through Vienna en route to Germany has had little impact on the city of nearly 18 million people said Eichtinger We have managed to accommodate 90000 refugees in Austria but the numbers have slowed in recent months London has never been in the qualityoflife top ten says Mercer damaged by its poor scores for air pollution traf c congestion and climate After London Edinburgh is the nextranking British city in 46th place Paris has suffered the biggest fall in the most recent rankings Paris remained stable for several years but has this year dropped ten places in the overall ranking said Mercer The drop was essentially due to the terrorist attacks in 2015 However it is important to highlight that safety issues are a very highly weighted factor within the basket so any small adjustments can have a big impact on the ranking Auckland in New Zealand was the highest ranking Englishspeaking city in the survey in third place followed by Vancouver in fth Australian cities also perform very highly in the survey with Sydney 10th and Melbourne 15th The Economist has consistently ranked Melbourne as the worlds most liveable city although its survey has been criticized as too Anglocentric War and political unrest are behind all the worstranked cities in the world Surprisingly Damascus is named as only the seventh worst ranked better than not just Baghdad but also Bangui in Central African Republic Sanaa in Yemen PortauPrince in Haiti Khartoum in Sudan and NDjamena in Chad,Vienna is the worlds best city to live in Baghdad is the worst and London Paris and New York do not even enter the top 35 according to international research into quality of life Germanspeaking cities dominate the rankings in the 18th Mercer Quality of Life study with Vienna joined by Zurich Munich Dusseldorf and Frankfurt in the top seven Paris has dropped down the table it has fallen ten places to 37th just ahead of London at 39th mostly because of the terrorist attacks on the city The study examined social and economic conditions health education housing and the environment It is used by big companies to decide where they should open of ces and factories and how much they should pay staff Helena Hartlauer 32 from Vienna said she was not surprised at her citys top position The citys social democratic government has a long tradition of investing money in highquality social housing which makes Vienna less expensive than other major cities I live in a 100sqmetre apartment in a good area about 20 minutes walk from the city centre But my rent is just 800 625 a month A similar apartment in London would cost over 2000 and even more in New York ranked 44th in the table US cities perform relatively badly in the study mostly because of issues around personal safety and crime The highest ranking city in the US is San Francisco at 28th Boston is 34th Canadian cities led by Vancouver do much better than their US rivals in the table You dont realize how safe Vienna is until you go abroad said Hartlauer We also have terri c public transport with the underground working 24 hours at weekends and it only costs 1 per trip Vienna bene ted enormously from the fall of the Berlin Wall becoming the gateway to Eastern European countries that often have historic connections to the former AustroHungarian empire Our big USP unique selling point is our geographical location said Martin Eichtinger Austrian ambassador to London who lived in Vienna for 20 years The fall of the Berlin Wall helped make Vienna a hub for companies wanting to do business in Central Europe According to the World Bank Austria has one of the highest gures for GDP gross domestic product per person in the world just behind the US and ahead of Germany and Britain although below neighbouring Switzerland Mercer says Zurich in Switzerland has the worlds second highest quality of life but the Viennese say their city is far more fun There are more students in Vienna than any other Germanspeaking city said Hartlauer Its a very fast growing young and lively city she added Vienna has long been overlooked by British weekend city break tourists who instead go to Barcelona or Berlin and tend to think of Austria as somewhere for skiing lakes and mountains But after an increase in budget ights from British cities such as Manchester and Edinburgh Vienna is becoming a more popular destination In 2015 there were 588000 British visitors to Vienna 18 more than the year before Vienna has ranked top in the last seven surveys said Mercer It scores highly in a number of categories it provides a safe and stable environment to live in a high standard of public transport and good recreational facilities London has never been in the qualityoflife top ten says Mercer damaged by its poor scores for air pollution traf c congestion and climate After London Edinburgh is the nextranking British city in 46th place Paris has suffered the biggest fall in the most recent rankings Paris has remained stable for several years but has this year dropped ten places said Mercer The drop was mostly due to the terrorist attacks in 2015 because safety is a very important factor in the survey Auckland in New Zealand was the highest ranking Englishspeaking city in the

84,There are eyes on you behind the bright lights and mirrored panels Pick up a boot and a camera will make sure you dont slip it into your bag Enter a department store and you will be watched But new technology is leading retailers to grow a different set of eyes less focused on shoplifting and more interested in your age sex size head shoulders knees and toes A few months ago IT rm Computer Sciences Corporation CSC produced a report that claimed around 30 of retailers use facial recognition technology to track customers instore Facial recognition is a technology that can identify people by analysing and comparing facial features from a database using devices such as Intel RealSense cameras which are able to analyse everything from particular expressions to the clothing brands someone is wearing Joe Jensen of Intels Retail Solutions Division says that the aim of bringing RealSense technology into shops is not to create databases of speci c peoples lives but rather to build generalized models of peoples lifestyles and shopping habits Its not so much that you need to know a particular customer Its that you need to know that this shopper has these characteristics and in the past that when those characteristics are present this is what a person tends to do If you combine recognition technology with databases of previous customer patterns you can start to predict a lot about what a person may or may not do in a shop If say theres a size10 woman wearing a gold necklace walking quickly towards the sock aisle you can use that data to predict she wants to well buy socks That could allow a retailer to automatically put targeted ads on screens aimed speci cally at that person If she looks like the type of person who wants to buy socks they will show her adverts for socks If it sounds familiar its because the online world has been using techniques like these for years If you search for something on Amazon youll be hounded by targeted banners for similar products on other sites Express a vague interest in canoeing and youll get ads for canoes wherever you go Yet bringing these systems into the physical world isnt a simple case of copy and paste It turns out that people do not react to cameras in the same way as they do to browser cookies Hoxton Analytics a Londonbased team of data scientists has developed a technology that makes use of machine learning and arti cial intelligence to categorize people based on the shoes they are wearing By analysing the style and size of peoples footwear as they walk past the sensor the system can identify a customers gender with between 75 and 80 accuracy Owen McCormack Hoxton Analytics CEO says that the focus of the system came about in part as a reaction to facial recognition My idea was why dont we simply consider the clothes someones wearing to understand demographics he said If I just showed you a shot of someones body you could probably tell me what gender they are However it turns out pointing a camera at someones chest or hips feels just as creepy as facial recognition The idea was what about peoples shoes The word creepy comes up a lot during discussions of instore tracking For retailers and data scientists the aim is to nd a way of obtaining information without coming across as intrusive For Hoxton Analytics and the retailers using the technology the answer is to look downwards This tactic of avoiding the face and staring at shoes says a lot about how we as physical beings react to being watched It suggests there are boundaries that do not exist on the internet Set sights on our torsos and we feel invaded But is making calculated judgments about a person based on their footwear actually any less invasive For McCormack the argument hinges on the fact that personally identi able information isnt being collected Right now shops are doing lots of incredibly invasive things but we just dont know about it The angle Hoxton Analytics is taking on that whole thing is well if you know someones a male or a female then your advertising will be much more ef cient If you know that everyone in your shop right now is a male youll be advertising PlayStations not hairdryers Keep it hidden and invisible monitoring lets shops optimize their output while keeping the customer unaware Put adaptable monitors and targeted advertising into the mix however and it becomes harder to hide the fact that a machine is watching you The argument from the retailers is that they do this to provide a personal shopping experience but it remains a grey area It still feels creepy From the perspective of retailers its understandable that physical shops want some of the information online outlets collect We allow this to happen online so why not of ine The thresholds of a shopping centre are different from those between websites and when you can wander freely from one place to another without a popup asking you to accept cookies the rules of consent change Then again for a generation growing up with online rst physical shop second the modes of online play may not be quite so invasive In the CSC report a survey indicated that while 72 of respondents aged 55 and over said they were very uncomfortable with these types of technologies being used in physical shops only 51 of 1624 year olds said the same Does this relative openness stem from a greater familiarity with digital technology or a blind belief in the goodwill of omnipresent organizations offering free services Is the creepiness of a technology an unvarying instinctive certainty or does it ebb and ow with degrees of social acceptance Whatever the case there are a growing number of eyes between the shelves and they care a lot about what youre wearing,Behind the bright lights and mirrored panels cameras are

to meditate on your artwork as you mindfully and creatively fill these pages with colour and urging potential colourers to take a few minutes out of your day wherever you are and colour your way to

128,Noise emanating from passing ships may disturb animals such as killer whales and dolphins far more than previously thought with new research showing that the animals communication and ability to nd prey could be hampered by the underwater din The low rumble of passing ships has long been connected to the disturbance of large whales But US researchers have documented persistent noise also occurring at medium and higher frequencies including at 20000Hz where killer whales also known as orcas hear best These noise disturbances could be hindering the ability of killer whales to communicate and echolocate the process of using sound to bounce off objects such as prey and identify where they are Dolphins and porpoises which also operate at higher frequencies may be suffering the same problems The ndings suggest that the noise could well affect the endangered population of killer whales that are found near the shipping lanes A population of just 84 killer whales forage up the US west coast and into Puget Sound The main concern relating to this is that even a slight increase in sound may make echolocation more dif cult for whales said Scott Veirs of Beamreach who led the research Thats worrying because their prey chinook salmon is already quite scarce Hearing a click off a salmon is probably one of the most challenging things a killer whale does Hearing that subtle click is harder if theres a lot of noise around you The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise created by about 1600 individual ships as they passed through Haro Strait in Washington State The twoyear study captured the sounds made by 12 different types of vessel including cruise ships container ships and military vehicles that passed through the strait about 20 times a day Some ships are quieter than others but the average intensity of noise next to all the ships was 173 underwater decibels equivalent to 111 decibels through the air about the sound of a loud rock concert Whales are not usually located right next to ships and so would be subjected to noise of about 60 to 90 decibels around the level of a lawnmower or a vacuum cleaner Veirs said scientists have already identi ed the impact of underwater noise upon baleen whales a class of fauna containing the largest animals on Earth But the new research underlines the threat posed to smaller whales dolphins and porpoises Ships have been thought of as low frequency sources of noise like the rumbling of lorries or trains he said Most noise is at that low frequency but the background noise of the ocean is raised even in the high frequencies This could be causing a signi cant problem that we need to look into more There are several knockon consequences of a noisy marine environment Whales may have to group together more closely in order to hear each other And should they fail to nd prey as effectively they will need to use up their stores of excess blubber This is problematic as this blubber often contains manmade pollutants that are toxic to whales if released fully into their systems Veirs said more work needs to be done to identify how badly the noise is affecting whales and also to quieten the ships that pass near the cetaceans It should be easy to reduce noise pollution he said Military ships are quite a bit quieter and there could be straightforward ways of transferring that technology to the commercial eet Another way to reduce noise is to slow down Decreasing speed by six knots could decrease noise intensity by half While the fortunes of some whale species such as humpbacks and blue whales the largest mammal on Earth have improved as whaling has declined others are still under threat from a range of factors The US federal government has recently protected nearly 40000 square miles of the Atlantic in an attempt to avoid losing the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale a species with just 500 individuals left In Europe killer whales are carrying dangerously high levels of banned polychlorinated biphenyl PCB chemicals in their blubber Scientists are still trying to determine whether pollutants caused the deaths of ve sperm whales that became stranded on the east coast of Britain in January 2016 Meanwhile around the coast of Australia whales face an increased threat from ship strikes and oil and gas drilling as well as Japans recent pledge to resume whaling in Antarctic waters,Noise from ships may disturb animals such as killer whales and dolphins much more than people previously thought New research shows that underwater noise could disturb the animals communication and ability to nd prey The low rumble of passing ships has for a long time been connected to the disturbance of large whales But US researchers have also found noise at medium and higher frequencies including at 20000Hz where killer whales also known as orcas hear best These noises could be disturbing the ability of killer whales to communicate and use echo to nd their prey Dolphins and porpoises which also hear at higher frequencies may have the same problems The ndings suggest that the noise could affect the endangered population of killer whales that are found near the shipping lanes up the west coast of the USA The main concern of this is that even a slight increase in sound may make echolocation more dif cult for whales said Scott Veirs who led the research Echolocation is the process of using sound to bounce off objects such as prey and identify where they are Thats worrying because their prey chinook salmon is already quite scarce Hearing a salmons click is probably one of the most challenging things a killer whale does Hearing that subtle click is harder if theres a lot of noise around you The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise created by about 1600 ships as they passed through Haro Strait in Washington State USA The twoyear study recorded the sound made by 12 different types of vessel including cruise ships container ships and military vehicles that passed through the strait about 20 times a day Some ships are quieter than others but the average intensity of noise next to all the ships was 173 underwater decibels equivalent to 111 decibels through the air about the sound of a loud rock concert Whales are not usually right next to ships and so would hear noise of about 60 to 90 decibels around the level of a lawnmower or a vacuum cleaner Veirs said scientists already knew about the impact of underwater noise on large whales But the new research shows the threat to smaller whales dolphins and porpoises Ships have been thought of as lowfrequency sources of noise like the rumbling of lorries or trains he said Most noise is at that low frequency but the background noise of the ocean is raised even in the high frequencies This could be causing a signi cant problem that we need to look into more There are several further consequences of a noisy underwater environment Whales may have to group together more closely in order to hear each other And if they fail to nd prey as effectively they will need to use up their stores of extra blubber This is a problem because this blubber often contains manmade pollutants that are toxic to whales if they are released fully into their systems Veirs said more work needs to be done to identify how badly the noise is affecting whales and also to quieten the ships that pass near them It should be easy to reduce noise pollution he said Military ships are quite a bit quieter and there could be simple ways of transferring that technology to commercial ships Another way to reduce noise is to slow down Decreasing speed by six knots could decrease noise by half While some whale species such as blue whales the largest mammal on Earth are safer now because whaling has declined others are still under threat from a range of factors The US federal government has recently protected nearly 40000 square miles of the Atlantic to try to avoid losing a species of whale with just 500 individuals left In Europe killer whales are carrying dangerously high levels of banned chemicals in their blubber Scientists are still trying to nd

115,More than one million British workers might be employed on zerohours contracts new gures reveal suggesting that British business is using the controversial employment terms far more widely than previously thought The gure derived from a poll of more than 1000 employers conducted by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development CIPD prompted renewed calls for the government to launch a full inquiry into the use of the contracts after a week in which a string of organizations from retail chains to Buckingham Palace have faced criticism for hiring staff but offering no guarantee of work and pay each week Employees on zerohours contracts often get no holiday or sick pay and have to ask permission before seeking additional work elsewhere The CIPD found that 38 of zerohours contract workers describe themselves as employed fulltime typically working 30 hours or more a week Onethird of voluntary sector employers use the contracts and one in four public sector organizations The latest numbers also call into question the accuracy of of cial data on the topic The Of ce for National Statistics has increased its estimate of the number of UK zerohours workers by 25 to around 250000 Peter Cheese the chief executive of the CIPD said There does need to be a closer look at what is meant by a zerohours contract the different forms that they take and clearer guidance on what good and bad practice in their use looks like And this needs to consider both the advantages and disadvantages in practice for businesses and employees Retailer Sports Direct recently became the focus of controversy on zerohours when it emerged that the company employs around 20000 of its 23000 staff on the contracts The retailers use of the contracts was followed by details of a string of other companies using the deals including cinema chain Cineworld and Buckingham Palace which uses them for its 350 summer workers Pub group J D Wetherspoon has 24000 of its staff 80 of its workforce on the terms Vidhya Alakeson from the Resolution Foundation an independent think tank added If its true that there are around one million people on zerohours contracts then that would be a substantial portion of the workforce this could no longer be dismissed as an issue affecting only a tiny minority The new estimate underlines the urgent need for a deep and thorough review of zerohours by the government which takes into account not only the scale of the problem but the effect these contracts have on workers employment rights earning capacity and personal wellbeing Unions and poverty campaign groups have accused employers of pressuring staff into signing the contracts as a way to evade their responsibilities and cut staff bene ts Dave Prentis of the trade union Unison said The vast majority of workers are only on these contracts because they have no choice They may give exibility to a few but the balance of power favours the employers and makes it hard for workers to complain Workers on zerohours contracts are often only told how many hours they will work when weekly or monthly rotas are worked out but are expected to be on call for extra work at short notice They should be entitled to holiday pay in line with the number of hours they work but do not qualify for sick pay The charity National Trust which employs many of its seasonal workers on zerohours contracts said it offered the same pay and bene ts to those workers pro rata as fulltime staff but needed some workers to be on a more exible arrangement We believe zerohours contracts are essential in our organization as we are very weather dependent a spokeswoman said Our properties have told us its important to be able to reorganize staff rotas quickly to respond to the weather and zerohours contracts allow us to do this Politician Chuka Umunna said the contracts should be the exception to the rule While some employees welcome the exibility of such contracts for many zerohours contracts leave them insecure and unsure of when work will come he said Some people have argued that the exibility of zerohours contracts may have allowed the UK to avoid higher levels of unemployment during the economic downturn while the CIPD research suggests that only 16 of those on zerohours contracts report that their employer frequently fails to provide them with suf cient hours each week The institutes gures also suggest that 17 of employers in the private sector made use of zero hours contracts considerably lower than the 34 of organizations in the voluntary sector and 24 in the public sector Industries where employers were most likely to report at least one person on a zerohours contract were hotels catering and leisure 48 education 35 and healthcare 27,More than one million

27,It was a beautiful summer evening and I decided to go for a swim off Doolin Pier in County Clare Ireland where I moved in 2012 There was a woman in the water with Dusty a dolphin who has a great relationship with a group of people she regularly swims with Dusty arrived in Doolin in about 2008 and hundreds of people have swum with her since giving the impression that shes totally tame She has even starred in an Irish touristboard ad campaign in which a girl says she would like to touch a dolphin That evening this woman was tickling Dustys tummy and it just looked so inviting There were about 20 tourists and locals on the pier looking at this lovely spectacle Just after I got into the water Dusty left the woman she was with and went ballistic I found out afterwards that shes very territorial when she is with somebody Her tail was flapping wildly and at first I thought it was a display but then I twigged maybe shes angry I knew I had to get out of the water so I swam towards the pier but within microseconds Dusty had ploughed into me with her snout It was very powerful and painful and the speed was amazing I went hurtling forwards All these people on the pier were staring down at me openmouthed Dusty was still in the water beside me her tail flapping crazily That was more frightening than anything I thought if she hits me with her tail I could go under Im gone I was at the pier but couldnt get out because of my injuries I felt pure terror I shouted for help and a guy put his arm in and pulled me out on to the steps Then another man appeared and said he was an orthopaedic surgeon who specialized in marine trauma He had been driving into Doolin when he saw what was happening on the pier I was so cold and very worried I didnt know how bad my injuries were and my biggest fear was internal bleeding He checked me over and was very reassuring saying he couldnt feel any evidence of it but that I probably had broken bones I found out later that I had six spinal fractures three broken ribs and a damaged lung I was in hospital for five days in a back brace for several weeks and off work for five months with limited mobility stiffness and pain Then I was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress My neardeath experience had left me anxious about everything and overreacting in a way I had never done before I felt that people were looking at me in the wrong way I began to struggle with loud noises and I suffered from memory loss Three months before the accident I had opened a healthfood shop but I had to let it go because I could no longer work It was the toughest year ever but now its all behind me I had craniosacral therapy osteopathy and massage and am building up my own osteopathy practice now I have a new empathy with patients because I have been one I am grateful that I am healthy and I really want to prevent other people being injured We have this lovely idea about dolphins and have faith in them who would think a dolphin would ever attack a person If you see a ferocious animal coming at you with its teeth bared its scary but dolphins have this lovely wide smile I dont have any anger towards Dusty I respect her But I was in her territory and shes a wild unpredictable animal People need to know that So many come here to swim with her and they dont understand how dangerous it can be Mine were reportedly among several injuries that summer After the man pulled me out of the water Dusty swam away but then she came back and was bobbing vertically next to me looking at me We locked eyes and I felt there was complete remorse in her She was a totally different dolphin the anger had gone The people on the pier were in awe When she had that little moment with me that was the end of the terror I made my peace with her,It was a

171,A degree in Spanish got me my fi rst job as a journalist with an international press agency in Mexico City but it didnt prevent me blundering badly as a rookie reporter I had just arrived in the Mexican capital after a Greyhound bus journey all the way from New York and the job interview was a test of my language skills In my new role day shifts were spent on the streets in political rallies and nights were spent alone in the offi ce coordinating the coverage from strifetorn El Salvador Nicaragua Guatemala and the rest of Central America But I also had to report on occasional disasters fi res floods and explosions at firework factories It was as a reporter that I soon found out that I was as bad at understanding numbers in Spanish as I was at calculating them in English Phone calls meant for the police got Mexican grandmothers out of bed at 2am because I had misunderstood a number and dialled a dodgy digit Even worse victims were piled too high in my stories almost 83 dead in a fi re at 6pm turned out to be as few as 38 by 7pm 12 people injured in a coach crash soon became two and so it went on Finally I got a call from the main offi ce in Washington I dont know what training you have had an editor yelled but has no one ever told you a death toll cant go down Why are numbers in another language such a conundrum It may have to do with different numbering systems If we consider that in German for example which belongs to the same IndoEuropean language family as English 230pm becomes halb drei half of three and 21 becomes einundzwanzig one and twenty clearly different numeral systems can cause confusion and thats without even considering indigenous languages with numeral systems so rare they are in danger of dying out Some experts believe there is a link between dyscalculia the diffi culty in comprehending arithmetic and problems learning foreign languages particularly if languages are learnt by rote since this involves the sequential processes that students with dyscalculia struggle with But some students who struggle to learn languages with a grammar textbook may thrive in a foreignlanguage setting where learning is more natural and less reliant on sequences of adjectives prepositions and so on In my case I have always found languages easy enough apart from the numbers But perhaps its also because numbers in a nonnative language are often heard out of context or in isolation when the listener might have switched off from the foreign language and be unable to suddenly tune in A straw poll of multilingual friends found that many can be fl orid in French or Italian when ordering from a restaurant menu for example but freeze if they have to relay numbers especially over the phone Numbers seem to be taxing but no one could really say why In my case being numerically challenged in a foreign tongue followed me from Mexico to other countries and from Spanish to German and Portuguese But in that fi rst journalism job getting the numbers wrong didnt always add up to failure One night a Mexican colleague learnt that the American consul in the port city of Veracruz was being held hostage at gunpoint in his offi ce With no senior Englishspeaking reporter in the offi ce it was left to me to try to reach the consulate by phone Having got the number wrong I was put through to an extension elsewhere in the building

12,Young Cubans are flocking to use the first known free openaccess internet service in the communist island nation which has been made possible by one of Cubas most famous artists A modest cultural centre in the capital city Havana has suddenly become a rare source of free wifi The internationally renowned Cuban artist Kcho is providing the service Perhaps more surprisingly his spokesman said the move had been approved by the stateowned telecommunications utility Etecsa The service is reportedly very slow especially when the centre gets crowded But in a country where only an estimated 5 of

88,Up to a billion people will remain in extreme poverty by 2030 unless countries focus on inequalities and confront social economic and cultural forces that block their escape or pull them back into impoverishment a major report warns The report by the Chronic Poverty Advisory Network CPAN asserts that many people may rise above the poverty line of 125 a day only to tumble back when they are hit by a combination or sequence of shocks such as drought illness and insecurity or con ict Drawing on household panel surveys the report found that in parts of rural Kenya and in South Africa 30 to 40 of those who escaped from poverty fell back rising to 60 in some areas of Ethiopia between 1999 and 2009 Even in successful countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam the proportion has been 20 Individual cases highlight the ease with which people can slip back into poverty Amin 61 from rural Bangladesh has seen his livelihood gradually decline due to his own and his wifes illnesses the cost of his sons marriage the death of his father and loss of goods such as shing nets Lovemore 74 from Zimbabwe has become one of the poorest people in his village He recently lost his job as a carpark attendant due to ill health and had to take in his ve grandchildren after the death of his daughters We need to ensure that people lifted out of poverty remain above the poverty line permanently Too many families are experiencing two steps forward one step back where they struggle to recover from personal or bigger setbacks Governments shouldnt assume that just because somebodys income hits 125 that means job done said Andrew Shepherd research fellow at the Overseas Development Institute a partner of CPAN and lead author of the report A UN highlevel panel considering a new development framework to succeed the Millennium Development Goals after 2015 said the goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030 was within reach The report however argues that more of the same will not get to zero Despite a drop in extreme poverty from 19bn in 1990 to 12bn in 2010 the report says that progress in the next 15 years will be much harder The big gains in China are unlikely to be matched by similar progress elsewhere while climaterelated shocks and deep poverty in parts of subSaharan Africa will slow momentum The report calls for a shift in thinking about poverty to focus on the chronically poor those who are poor for many years or their entire lives and for more emphasis on stopping impoverishment the descent into poverty Governments have been quite good at moving people over the poverty line because that is relatively easy there is a tendency to pick the lowhanging fruit but they have shied away from the more dif cult job of tackling chronic poverty said Shepherd The report says progress on poverty reduction while impressive to date has had less of an impact on the chronically poor than on those who were already closer to the poverty line It will not be possible to get to zero unless development policies prioritize those living in chronic poverty it adds Policymakers must aim for a zero tripod of separate but interdependent objectives tackle chronic poverty stop impoverishment sustain poverty escapes They put forward a trio of policies all of which require massive global investment The rst is social assistance a safety net to bring the poorest people closer to a decent standard of living An example of such a scheme is Ethiopias productive safety net programme that allowed thousands of vulnerable households to withstand drought without having to curtail education spending The second is education from early childhood to the start of work to enable people to escape and stay out of poverty Education also has the advantage of being a portable asset The third is propoorest economic growth policies to ensure that the bene ts of increasing national prosperity reach the very poorest people Economic growth really is critical but not just any old growth Shepherd said It has to generate not just employment but decent jobs not just insecure lowpaying jobs There are ways of doing this like Indias rural employment guarantees scheme which has boosted urban not just rural wages Another example cited by the report is South Africas extension of the minimum wage to groups such as domestic workers All this will take money and the report says one obvious implication is that stronger domestic tax systems and greater tax revenues will be required Aid will also be needed for the startup costs for social assistance universal health coverage and to nance education including scholarships for the poorest children There remains a huge role for aid in the next 20 years as many developing countries spend less than 500 on each of their citizens a year Even Nigeria with its oil wealth spends only 650 per capita Shepherd said Against a backdrop of crises in Syria South Sudan and the Central African Republic con ict and environmental disasters have to be addressed and the report says it is essential that governments work to reduce the risk of con ict and to establish inclusive peace settlements Incorporating reducing income inequality as a post2015 goal would steer the international agenda in the right direction given that lessening or containing inequality speeds up the impact of economic growth on poverty reduction The report argues that if the inequalities that affect the poorest people such as access to land labour markets and the power relationships between men and women are addressed this would tackle two goals at the same time reducing chronic poverty and inequality The authors urge governments to develop an inclusive national development plan and to work with civil society to ensure the poorest people are represented politically as well as tackling dif cult social norms such as dowries and witchcraft that contribute to extreme poverty This often means challenging and perhaps sweeping away aspects of the status quo and represents the most marked departure from business as usual,A new report has warned that up to a billion people will remain in extreme poverty by 2030 unless countries confront the social economic and cultural forces that keep them in poverty The report by the Chronic Poverty Advisory Network says that many people may rise above the poverty line of 125 a day but slip back again when they experience problems such as drought or illness and insecurity or con ict The report found that in parts of rural Kenya and in South Africa 30 to 40 of people who escaped from poverty fell back again rising to 60 in some areas of Ethiopia between 1999 and 2009 Even in successful countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam the proportion was 20 Individual examples show how easy it is for people to slip back into poverty Amin from rural Bangladesh has seen his livelihood gradually decline due to his own and his wifes illnesses the cost of his sons marriage the death of his father and loss of goods such as shing nets Lovemore from Zimbabwe has become one of the poorest people in his village He recently lost his job due to bad health and had to take in his ve grandchildren after the death of his daughters We need to ensure that people who are lifted out of poverty remain above the poverty line permanently Too many families are slipping back into poverty because they struggle to recover from personal or bigger setbacks Governments shouldnt assume that just because somebodys income reaches 125 that means job done said Andrew Shepherd lead author of the report A UN highlevel panel said it was possible to achieve the goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030 The report however argues that more of the same will not get to zero Despite a drop in extreme poverty from 19bn in 1990 to 12bn in 2010 the report says that progress in the next 15 years will be much harder The big gains in China are unlikely to be matched by similar progress elsewhere while climaterelated shocks and deep poverty in parts of subSaharan Africa will slow down progress The report says the focus should be on the chronically poor those who are poor for many years or their entire lives and on stopping the descent into poverty Governments have been quite good at moving people over the poverty line because that is relatively easy But they have shied away from the more dif cult job of trying to solve chronic poverty said Shepherd The report says progress on poverty reduction has had less of an impact on the chronically poor than on those who were already closer to the poverty line It will not be possible to get to zero unless development policies focus on the chronically poor it adds The report suggests three policies all of which require massive global investment The rst is social assistance to bring the poorest people closer to a decent standard of living The second is education from early childhood to the start of work to enable people to escape and stay out of poverty The third is economic growth policies that ensure that the bene ts of increasing national prosperity reach the very poorest people All this will cost money and the report says one obvious implication is that countries will need greater tax revenues Aid will also be needed for the startup costs for social assistance universal health coverage and to nance education including scholarships for the poorest children There remains a huge role for aid in the next 20 years as many developing countries spend less than 500 on each of their citizens a year Even Nigeria with its oil wealth spends only 650 per person Shepherd said With the current crises in Syria South Sudan and the Central African Republic the report says it is essential that governments try to reduce the risk of con ict and to create peace The report also argues that if the inequalities which affect the poorest people such as access to land labour markets and the power relationships between men and women are addressed this would tackle two goals at the same time reducing chronic poverty and inequality The authors urge governments to develop an inclusive national development plan and to work with civil society to ensure that the poorest people are represented politically as well as trying to stop dif cult social norms such as dowries and witchcraft that contribute to extreme poverty This often means challenging parts of

89,Unusually for someone who likes to chat Kenton Cool can barely speak Exerting himself at high altitude has left his voice a throaty growl He is now in Kathmandu the capital of Nepal having flown down from Everest base camp that morning Cool is reflecting on a startling sequence of climbs completed over the course of the previous weekend Early on Saturday morning he reached the summit of Nuptse the first and lowest of the three main summits in the Everest horseshoe that surrounds the glaciated valley called the Western Cwm That same day he climbed up to the summit of Everest itself reaching the top in complete darkness early on Sunday He and his climbing partner then continued on to the summit of Lhotse the third of this spectacular threepeaks challenge on Monday morning It was a snatched opportunity he says For the first time since the late 1990s there were fixed ropes on all three mountains That doesnt take away the physical achievement of what I did Ive set the bar at a certain level But whoever comes along next will move the bar further and do it without ropes or bottled oxygen Sixty years after Everest was first climbed much of the coverage is looking back to Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay and their age of innocence from the modern era of commercialism and environmental degradation Ive asked Cool to look forward and imagine what top climbers might be doing 60 years from now I hate to think he says but mentions the Swiss climber Ueli Steck who fled the mountain in April following what Cool terms an altercation with a crowd of Sherpas at Camp 2 Steck he says was planning to climb Everests west ridge first done in 1963 descend to the South Col and then immediately climb Lhotse via a new route all without fixed ropes Ueli had been training like a machine Cool says Hes a climber in a class all his own Hes technically brilliant but he had also taken his physical condition to an astronomic level It would have been amazing to see what he could have done What tourism will look like is another matter One clue is in the stunning helicopter rescue performed by Simone Moro Stecks climbing partner whose intemperate language provoked the confrontation at Camp 2 Moro flew back to Everest on Tuesday at the controls of a highpowered helicopter to rescue a stricken climber at an altitude of 7800 metres It was the highest rescue yet performed on Everest and highlights the exponential rise in helicopter flights in recent years By 2073 the infrastructure on the mountain could include a helipad on the South Col bringing tourists breathing bottled oxygen In the meantime they are transforming the potential for rescuing both climbers and the far more numerous trekkers heading as far as base camp Whether the Everest region can continue to cope with a booming tourism sector remains to be seen according to mountain geographer and environmentalist Alton Byers The combination of climate change and tourism he says is creating new stresses on the Sherpa homeland The retreat and in some cases disappearance of glaciers in the Everest region are having a major impact already Everywhere you go people are talking about how theres less water Theres less water for agriculture and less water for all the new lodges that are getting built In the Sherpa town of Namche Bazaar he says a new fivemile pipeline is being laid to bring water to service the growing tourist demand for showers and flush toilets The local stream has become contaminated with human waste and does not provide enough water for a place that in high season is bursting at the seams Every village is digging a pit just beyond the houses for garbage Khumbu has the highest landfill sites in the world he says Human waste at base camp is now managed well and removed in plastic barrels But according to Byers these barrels are emptied into a huge pit a few hours down the valley that could leak into the regions watercourses These problems can be solved but we need to get serious about it he says One climber can spend 85000 climbing Everest And thats fine But at some point were going to have to address these other priorities For half a million dollars a year you could solve most of them Climate change is another matter Byers works with local conservation committees to identify and plan for the impacts of climate change most usually finding new water sources or introducing rainwater harvesting The rapid buildup of glacial lakes that threaten to burst and flood the Sherpa homeland is a constant threat Theres going to come a time when people are going to have to get out of their way Changing weather patterns are also having an impact on tourism Increased cloud cover in periods of normally clear weather is closing Lukla Airport the gateway to the Everest region more often A new road for 4x4s is being built to Lukla to guarantee the flow of tourists and their money but Byers is concerned that the rapid spread of the road network in Nepal is being done on the cheap with disastrous consequences in terms of soil erosion and landslides Everest is the icon everyone knows he says Its the canary in the coalmine that everyone understands Its the perfect laboratory for figuring out how to address some of these problems like the impacts of climate change and tourism,Kenton Cool can hardly speak All the physical effort at

132,An international agreement to improve safety in Bangladeshs clothing factories is facing the threat of legal action as factory owners demand compensation for the cost of closures and repair work With some repair programmes expected to take months factory owners say they cannot shoulder the costs of paying staff while factories are closed alongside the expense of some major works needed to ensure buildings are safe The building overhauls are being carried out in the wake of the collapse of the Rana Plaza complex in the capital of Bangladesh Dhaka in 2013 in which 1138 people were killed The problems come as hundreds of Bangladeshi clothing factories per month are inspected for firesafety and structural problems under the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh which is backed by over 170 international brands including Primark and Marks Spencer and international trade unions including IndustriALL The owner of one Dhakabased factory Softex Cotton has threatened legal action against the Accord after his factory was closed down due to structural problems prompting a demand for a reported 100m in compensation Another factory owner who declined to be named said that once a factory closed its doors even for a few months it would lose orders and close permanently There is no such thing as temporary closure he said The factory owner said that the Accord agreement had pussyfooted around the issue of who paid for factory closures amid efforts to get as many brands as possible to sign up to a deal in the wake of the Rana Plaza disaster He said there was no clear process in place to handle the costs involved Jenny Holdcroft policy director for IndustriALL which has been closely involved in the Accord said that the agreement ensured that factories would not lose orders during closure because brands had committed to maintain orders with suppliers for two years While 12 factories have been identified so far by the Accord as needing significant work Holdcroft said many of those only needed partial closure in order to reduce stress on the building so production could continue on other floors The Accord also legally binds brands to ensure that workers are paid during factory closures She said the detail on who would make payments had been left open in order to ensure that all those factory owners who could afford to pay for repairs and compensation for workers made the necessary contribution This was always going to be a topic of negotiation Brands dont want to commit to paying so that rich factory owners who have just pocketed the profits and not been spending on their factories for years continue to do so There was obviously going to be disruption If there was no disruption there would be no change she said A spokesman for the Accord said negotiations over payments and even legal action would not hold up its work to improve safety in factories However pressure on the Accord to contribute to the payment of displaced workers has ratcheted up after a rival factorysafety group backed by US retailers including Walmart and Gap the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety set aside 5m to help pay factory workers for up to two months while work is carried out on the buildings it has identified as needing improvement It has so far identified five factories in four buildings where production needed to be suspended The Alliance is sharing the workers salary along with entrepreneurs so now there is a big confusion We had a big meeting with the Accord to make them understand they have to come forward or how will we

26,Junior Smart knows a lot about gangs He is now 36 and his life can be divided into two distinct phases He tells how in his late teens after his mother died he became drawn into a south London gang which at the time helped fill a huge vacuum They became my new support group he says At first it was just a bit of fun but then it became more serious more and more about making money They got involved in criminality That is how it was At school Smart failed his GCSEs then retook them at college and passed the lot He secured a fulltime job in administration and worked as a DJ But on the side he was making money illegally as part of the gang Eventually he was arrested for serious drugrelated offences and was sent to prison for 12 years Instantly he says his sense of invincibility was shattered The first night after I was arrested was the biggest wakeup call of my life he says I had been living a dual life I had been living as one person to my peers and another person to my peers enemies I spent a long time sorting myself out Today Junior Smart runs a team of 12 fulltime workers and six volunteers which aims to turn young criminals and gang members away from crime Most of those working there are like Smart himself exoffenders A few are still serving their sentences but are regarded as having reformed enough to be allowed out during the day to help They work with the police the probation service and other voluntary organizations to help those who feel trapped and frightened in the violent criminal gangs that operate across London For Smart the extraordinary journey from gang member to mentor began when he witnessed from within a prison system that was so obviously failing its inmates He recalls a drug addict he befriended who to his dismay kept returning I was touched by the people who kept coming back in he says I couldnt believe that nothing was being done about it I was talking to the inmates and they knew what needed to be changed in their lives but the problem is that the prison system only deals with the index offence One guy had a 300aweek cocaine habit which he funded through burglary He would tell me stuff about how he would walk into a house even when he knew people were there So although he had a drug addiction it never got dealt with The thing that got me about that is that it is simply a revolving door That case and scores of others persuaded Smart to start working as a prison listener an inmate who helps reassure new arrivals and talks them through their first days inside From there he developed what he calls his own little plan to run his own scheme once out of prison using the experience of exoffenders to help others reject the revolving door of prison life He was released early after five years At the end of my sentence I got an opportunity to put my little model into practice he says So what does he think now Does he believe that after the riots of last August and the governments promise to crack down on gangs things are getting better He is careful to offer some praise to the police and says much of their work in hauling in gang members has been good But overall he is highly critical of a disjointed government approach that believes that once the leader of a gang is arrested the problem is solved He agrees with the findings of a report that says the arrest of gang leaders can even make things worse He says the effect of removing the leader is often to destabilize the entire gang He draws a diagram of the hierarchy on a pad When you arrest the top guy people start fighting for position all the way up Who was the most loyal Who had the most respect It is a bit like a family They are more likely to act out through violence It means that the arrest of the gang leaders has been nullified because it has not had a longterm effect They have not even given the community a respite Can it actually make the streets more dangerous It can do because in the vacuum the recruitment and manipulation of young people becomes even more prevalent creating new lower levels all the way down People take sides If one gang or another territorial street network knows that an elder leader has been taken out then they suddenly think that gangs weak And so we have interestate disputes going on And what happens when that elder is in prison He forms alliances with other gang members or when he gets released he then tries to retake control That is when violence happens In order to spread risk down to the lowest levels he says gangs are now recruiting far more in primary schools The youngest members are called tinies Over the last years we have seen more and more of this The tinies can be as young as eight to eleven years old The young are brought in to shield their seniors from risk It is often they who are charged with doing the street dealing or even the stabbing he says Smart says that with a lack of government funding and commitment to longterm rehabilitation the challenges are immense particularly in the current economic climate I try to engage a young person who has been earning 300 a week through illegal methods It was hard before to try to convince him But with unemployment high and cuts to benefits it makes things tougher That said his project which has well over 1000 clients is delivering results Fewer than 20 of those who come in for help reoffend From personal experience Smart refuses to write off a single individual as beyond redemption and that is what drives him on I dont think that about anybody he says,Junior Smart knows a lot about gangs He is now 36 and his life can be divided into two phases When he was a teenager after his mother died he joined a south London gang At the time it helped fill a big gap in his life They became my new

139,As colourful sh were swimming past him off the Greek coast Cathal Redmond was convinced he had taken some great photos with his rst underwater camera But when he looked at the results on dry land the images were brown and murky Having taken the pictures while holding his breath underwater he blamed the limited time he had to set up the shots All he needed the industrial designer thought was a little more time to properly capture the sh in their natural environment He vowed to make the little extra time needed a reality and the result is his invention of the Express Dive a re llable air storage device held in the mouth that lets users swim underwater for two minutes It is aimed at bridging the gap between snorkelling with its limited scope and scuba diving which gives divers the freedom to breathe underwater but at the cost of using cumbersome and expensive gear The prototype of the invention which is still in the initial stages of testing individual parts looks like a cross between a scuba mouthpiece and a water bottle I wanted to enable people to do more So rather than just get in underwater and spend 30 seconds holding their breath I wanted to do a little bit more than they were able to do says Redmond 27 In 2006 the Irish designer completed a scubadiving course and loved the feeling of being able to breathe underwater and observe sh in their natural environment Less enjoyable however were the ns the weight belt the wetsuit air tank mask and all the other equipment I was very keenly aware of the fact that I had about 50kg strapped to me and getting into the water was quite foreign when you are used to trying to keep yourself at the surface It was a very surreal experience he says The real problem is that it is very limiting as to what you can do Although it allows you to stay underwater for longer you have to plan your whole day around it You have 20kg to 50kg of gear with you you cant be walking on the beach and decide you want to go in Planning is a very big part of it It demands a lot There is a lot of relearning required It was during a nalyear project for his product design degree at the University of Limerick that Redmond produced the Express Dive The device has two main parts When above the surface the unit uses a fan to suck in air via a vent in the mouthpiece The air accelerated around the motordriven turbine is compressed through a series of valves and stored in the attached tank which has a display light that ashes green when it is full When air is no longer being taken in the vent shuts off and as the user dives air is fed back via the mouthpiece That display which is in the users eyeline then acts as a health bar turning from green to red when the air runs low The device can take in enough air for two minutes of diving and takes approximately the same amount of time to be re lled When you put the compressor into the unit with all of the rest of the stuff the batteries and the electronics and the membranes for the scuba delivery the big trick was to be able to get it small enough so that it would be able to be held through the teeth and out of the mouth Redmond says The electrics are shielded from the water in the casing and are recharged using inductive power transfer a system using an electromagnetic eld similar to the pads which can wirelessly charge mobile phones so that there is no need for exposed wires Redmond says the mouthpiece feels similar to using a snorkel He likens it to an extension of the lungs in that the user is taking a deep breath and then using it underwater It is an extension of the bodys capacity to store air he says The prototype made from highdensity foam aluminium and silicone has been tested in parts Redmond says he has shown that the motor can compress two minutes worth of air into the unit and that the design can be effectively held in the divers mouth What he has not yet done is test the device on a diver fully submerged for two minutes But with enough testing Redmond is con dent he can get a fully functioning device that will not endanger swimmers underwater Redmond recently came runnerup for the International James Dyson Award which will give him 5000 to further develop the project Early indications are that the device would be priced at 280 he says and it is likely to weigh anywhere from 1kg to 3kg depending on the safety features needed To anyone who thinks two minutes of air is no more than a minor improvement on snorkelling Redmond says it could make all the difference underwater The typical swimmer can hold their breath for about 40 seconds while underwater he says Two minutes is not a lot of time but it is a lot longer than that he says,Cathal Redmond was swimming off the Greek coast and he was sure he had taken some great photos of colourful sh with his rst underwater camera But when he looked at the results later the photos were brown and murky He took the pictures while holding his breath underwater and blamed the limited time he had to set up the shots All he needed he thought was a little more time to photograph the sh in their natural environment He decided to invent something to make that little extra time a reality and the result is his invention of the Express Dive a re llable air storage device which is held in the mouth and lets people swim underwater for two minutes It bridges the gap between snorkelling with its limitations and scuba diving which gives divers the freedom to breathe underwater but requires heavy and expensive gear The prototype of the invention looks like a combination of a scuba mouthpiece and a water bottle I wanted to enable people to do more So rather than just go underwater and spend 30 seconds holding their breath I wanted people to do a little bit more says Redmond 27

equipment he needed I was very aware of the fact that I had about 50kg of equipment on me and going under the water felt strange when you are used to trying to keep yourself at the surface It was a very surreal experience he says The real problem is that scuba diving is very limiting Although it allows you to stay underwater for longer you have to plan your whole day around it You have 20kg to 50kg of gear with you you cant be walking on the beach and decide you want to go in Planning is a very big part of it It was during a nalyear project for his product design degree that Redmond produced the Express Dive The device has two main parts When above the surface the unit sucks in air through a vent in the mouthpiece The air is compressed through valves and stored in the tank The tank has a light that ashes green when it is full When air is no longer being taken in the vent shuts off and as the person dives air is fed back via the mouthpiece The light turns from green to red when the air start to run out The device can take in enough air for two minutes of diving and takes approximately the same amount of time to re ll When you put the compressor into the unit with all of the rest of the stuff the batteries and the electronics the dif cult thing was to make it small enough so that people could hold it in their mouths Redmond says Redmond says the mouthpiece feels similar to using a snorkel He compares it to an extension of the lungs in that the user is taking a deep breath and then using it underwater It is an extension of the bodys ability to store air he says The prototype has been tested in parts Redmond says he has shown that the motor can compress two minutes worth of air into the unit and that the design can be held in the divers mouth What he has not yet done is test the device on a diver fully submerged for two minutes But with enough testing Redmond is con dent he can get a fully working device that will not endanger swimmers underwater The device will probably cost 280 he says and it is likely to weigh from 1kg to 3kg depending on the safety features needed To anyone who thinks two minutes of air is no more than a very small improvement on snorkelling Redmond says it could make a big difference underwater The typical swimmer can hold their breath for about 40 seconds while underwater he says Two minutes is not a lot of time but it is a lot longer than that he says,train,ADV,INT
144,Passing clouds One of the pleasures of flying is seeing clouds close up Even though they seem insubstantial they carry a considerable weight of water around 500 tonnes in a small cumulus cloud And water is denser than air So why dont clouds fall out of the sky like rain They do But the droplets take a long time to sink An average cloud would take a year to fall one metre On cloud nine Most of us are happy to label clouds fluffy ones or nasty black ones but meteorologists identify more than 50 cloud types based on shape and altitude These fit into categories given numbers from one to nine Cloud nine is the vast towering cumulonimbus so to be on cloud nine implies being on top of the world Around the rainbow Theres no better place to see a rainbow than from a plane Rainbows are produced when sunlight hits raindrops We see a bow because the Earth gets in the way but from a plane a rainbow is a complete circle When passing over clouds the planes shadow appears neatly in the centre of the effect Mr blue sky Sunlight is white containing all the colours of the spectrum but as it passes through air some of the light is scattered when it interacts with the gas molecules Blue light scatters more than the lowerenergy colours so the blue appears to come from the sky Theres life out there Apart from clouds and other planes we dont expect to see much directly outside a flying aircrafts window but the air is seething with bacterial life as many as 1800 different types of bacteria have been detected over cities and they can reach twice the cruising height of a plane Turbulence terror Even the most experienced flyer can be turned green by turbulence The outcome can be anything from repeated bumping to sudden dramatic plunges The good news for nervous flyers is that no modern airliner has ever been brought down by turbulence People have been injured and occasionally killed when they are not strapped in or get struck by poorly secured luggage but the plane is not going to be knocked out of the sky Inflight radiation When body scanners were introduced at airports there were radiation scares but the level produced is the same as passengers receive in one minute of flight The Earth is constantly bombarded by cosmic rays natural radiation from space that has more impact at altitude You cant cure jet lag The world is divided into time zones The result is that longhaul travel results in a difference between local time and your bodys time causing jet lag However its effects can be minimized by keeping food bland for 24 hours before travel drinking plenty of fluids and living on your destination time from the moment you reach the aircraft Supersonic 747s Many of us have travelled faster than sound There are a number of jet streams in the upper atmosphere notably on the journey from the US to Europe where a temperature inversion causes a corridor of air to move as fast as 250mph If an airliner with an airspeed of 550mph enters a jet stream the result can be to fly at 800mph above sounds 740mph Flying through time Time zones provide an artificial journey through time but special relativity means that a flight involves actual time travel Its so minimal though that crossing the Atlantic weekly for 40 years would only move you 11000th of a second into the future Terrible tea Dont blame the cabin attendant if your tea isnt great Water should be just under 100C when it is poured on to tea leaves but that isnt possible on a plane Its impossible to get water beyond 90C during flight so choose coffee I cant hear my food Airline food has a reputation for being bland and tasteless Some of the problem may not be poor catering though A plane is a noisy environment and there is evidence that food loses some of its savour when we are exposed to loud noises Needle in a haystack With modern technology it seems strange that Malaysian flight MH370 could disappear without a trace yet finding a missing aircraft is a needlein ahaystack problem The plane knows its location both from GPS and inertial tracking but this information is not relayed elsewhere in real time That would be perfectly possible Oceangoing ships have had tracking since the 1980s the limitation is not technology but a lack of legislation requiring it Volcanic fallout Air travel can be cancelled by volcanic activity Glasslike ash particles melt in the heat of the engine then solidify on the rotors A clearskies policy in an ash cloud may be inconvenient but the risks of ignoring the ash are clear The wing myth For many years we taught the wrong explanation for the way wings keep planes in the air In fact almost all a planes lift comes from Newtons Third Law of Motion The wing is shaped to push air downwards As the air is pushed down the wing gets an equal and opposite push upwards lifting the plane Forget electric planes When we see ultralight experimental electric planes its easy to assume there will soon be clean green electric airliners but it wont happen any time soon Aircraft fuel packs in a remarkable amount of energy Batteries are much less efficient To provide the same energy as a tonne of fuel would take 100 tonnes of batteries and a 747 uses 150 to 200 tonnes of fuel Unless battery technology is made vastly more efficient electric airliners wont get off the ground Beware the vortex Pilots often wait a long time to get clearance This is to allow the air to settle after a previous takeoff as a planes wingtips generate vortices in the air which can take two or three minutes to disperse If the following aircraft set off immediately the rapidly moving air would make the plane difficult to handle The delay gives the air time to recover from the miniature whirlwinds caused by the preceding plane The doors arent locked In practice the doors on a plane dont need to be locked If you watch an aircraft door being opened it swings in an unusual way It first has to be opened inwards before manoeuvring it out of the way Once the plane has taken off a significant pressure difference soon builds up between the inside of the plane and the outside This differential forces the door into place To open it you would have to pull against the air pressure well beyond the capabilities of human muscles,Passing clouds One of the pleasures of flying is seeing clouds close up Even though they seem to be light they carry a lot

156,Temperature rises resulting from unchecked climate change will be at the severe end of those projected according to a new scientific study The scientist leading the research said that unless emissions of greenhouse gases were cut the planet would heat up by a minimum of 4C by 2100 twice the level the worlds governments deem dangerous The research indicates that fewer clouds form as the planet warms meaning less sunlight is reflected back into space driving temperatures up further still The way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery surrounding future climate change Professor Steven Sherwood at the University of New South Wales in Australia who led the new work said This study breaks new ground twice first by identifying what is controlling the cloud changes and second by strongly discounting the lowest estimates of future global warming in favour of the higher and more damaging estimates 4C would likely be catastrophic rather than simply dangerous Sherwood said For example it would make life difficult if not impossible in much of the tropics and would guarantee the eventual melting of the Greenland ice sheet and some of the Antarctic ice sheet with sea levels rising by many metres as a result The research is a big advance that halves the uncertainty about how much warming is caused by rises in carbon emissions according to scientists commenting on the study published in the journal Nature Hideo Shiogama and Tomoo Ogura at Japans National Institute for Environmental Studies said the explanation of how fewer clouds form as the world warms was convincing and agreed this indicated future climate change would be greater than expected But they said more challenges lay ahead to narrow down further the projections of future temperatures Scientists measure the sensitivity of the Earths climate to greenhouse gases by estimating the temperature rise that would be caused by a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere compared with preindustrial levels as is likely to happen within 50 years on current trends For two decades those estimates have run from 15C to 5C a wide range The new research narrowed that range to between 3C and 5C by closely examining the biggest cause of uncertainty clouds The key was to ensure that the way clouds form in the real world was accurately represented in computer climate models which are the only tool researchers have to predict future temperatures When water evaporates from the oceans the vapour can rise over nine miles to form rain clouds that reflect sunlight or it may rise just a few miles and drift back down without forming clouds In reality both processes occur and climate models encompassing this complexity predicted significantly higher future temperatures than those only including the ninemilehigh clouds Climate sceptics like to criticize climate models for getting things wrong and we are the first to admit they are not perfect said Sherwood But what we are finding is that the mistakes are being made by the models which predict less warming not those that predict more He added Sceptics may also point to the hiatus of temperatures since the end of the 20th century but there is increasing evidence that this inaptly named hiatus is not seen in other measures of the climate system and is almost certainly temporary Global average air temperatures have increased relatively slowly since a high point in 1998 caused by the ocean phenomenon El Nino but observations show that heat is continuing to be trapped in increasing amounts by greenhouse gases with over 90 disappearing into the oceans Furthermore a study in November 2013 suggested the pause may be largely an illusion resulting from the lack of temperature readings from polar regions where warming is greatest Sherwood accepts his teams work on the role of clouds cannot definitively rule out that future temperature rises will lie at the lower end of projections But he said for that to be the case one would need to invoke some new dimension to the problem involving a major missing ingredient for which we currently have no evidence Such a thing is not out of the question but requires a lot of faith He added Rises in global average temperatures of at least 4C by 2100 will have profound impacts on the world and the economies of many countries if we dont urgently start to curb our emissions,According to a new scientific study temperature rises caused by uncontrolled global warming could be at the high end of current estimates The scientist who led the research said that unless emissions of greenhouse gases are reduced the planet will heat up by a minimum of 4C by 2100 This is twice the level the worlds governments consider to be dangerous The research indicates that fewer clouds form as the planet warms which means less sunlight is reflected back into space This forces temperatures up even higher The way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery in the study of future climate change Professor Steven Sherwood at the University of New South Wales in Australia who led the new work said that the study broke new ground in two ways First it identified

74,Is this the moment when streaming goes truly mainstream According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry IFPI there were just 41m subscribers using music streaming services globally in 2014 It might be the biggest revenue growth area for the record business but it is still incredibly niche Not only that but a signi cant number of those subscribers come from bundled deals with mobile phone operators so it is debatable just how active its users are Apples greatest conjuring trick is to take something that already exists in the market downloads iTunes digital music players the iPod and smartphones the iPhone and adapt it to make it irresistible to the mainstream consumer Leaked information recently suggested that Apple is aiming to reach 100m subscribers which based on a subscription fee of 120 per year would generate 12bn annually To put that in context the entire global worth of recorded music in 2014 was just under 15bn Apple is good at mainstreaming products but its not that good Is this the end of downloading The iTunes Store arrived in 2003 2004 in Europe at a time when MP3 piracy seemed insurmountable Apple managed to persuade consumers to pay for downloads and grew a huge business which it dominated with an estimated 70 market share Downloads still hold the biggest share of digital income for recorded music making up 52 of total digital income in 2014 according to IFPI numbers Apple holds the lions share of this making it the single biggest music retailer in the world But download revenue peaked in 2013 in the UK at 283m and fell to 249m in 2014 The decline in download sales hit the US in 2013 so Apple bought Beats in 2014 for 3bn not only to get into the premium headphone market but also to make the transition from music ownership downloads to music access subscription streaming Apple and the record industry cannot afford to get rid of the download market just yet so streaming and downloading will have to coexist under the Apple brand one representing the future as the other gets progressively slower and sicker The vast majority of people out there like music but dont love it enough to pay 120 a year to listen to it a sporadic download purchase here and there will suit them just ne The average spend of a music buyer in the UK in 2014 for example was just 3952 according to research Expecting most of them to triple their annual spend on recorded music is something that even Apple will seriously struggle with Has Apple Connect made Apple the most artistfriendly service Apple have previously tried to build an artistfriendly platform via iTunes They called it Ping and it didnt work Apple Connect is something very different somewhere in the middle of YouTube Facebook and SoundCloud letting artists post music videos photos and more to their pro le pages It couldnt be any more 2015 if it tried Apple partly because of its scale and also partly because it treats music as art rather than content has generally had strong relations with not just the music industry but artists themselves and generally it has a good reputation among artists Compare that to Spotify which has been criticized by artists from Radioheads Thom Yorke to Taylor Swift In contrast Apple comes across as a benevolent uncle There is the smell of revolution in the air and Apple is making sure its on the right side of the battle lines when they are drawn up Where are the artist exclusives This is going to be the interesting bit when the service actually goes live Getting exclusives for big albums is going to become crucial to streaming Spotify paid a lot of money to get Led Zeppelin and Metallica exclusively Apple will have been watching this carefully and making its own notes It already has ACDC and the Beatles catalogues exclusively for download on iTunes but it remains to be seen if it can persuade these two to make the jump into streaming It also managed to get the surprise Beyonce album in 2013 before anyone else so it is inevitable that it will want more like that There is plenty of speculation about Apple looking to get exclusive rights to the new Adele album Giving iTunes the download exclusive on an album was not that big a leap of faith for acts given just how much of the download market it controls but trying to do that in streaming is not the same thing Add into this the fact that streaming now counts towards the album chart in markets like the UK and US and artists who still see the chart as a measure of success will not want to limit their audience by restricting themselves to one service Is this going to kill Spotify Some people are already saying that Apple Music will destroy rivals like Spotify However its not that simple Apple is entering a market where others have been working and gaining experience for many years It has a lot of catching up to do The winner of this battle will not be the company with the best service it will be the company with the most money Apples competitors have a head start in the market but they are losing huge amounts of money Spotify for example lost 931m in 2013 Apple on the other hand started 2015 by becoming the most pro table company in corporate history with 178bn in the bank If Apple Music loses Apple money the company will not continue it for long but it will not stop investment without at least trying to beat the

5,Introduction Did you know that in the UK there is no legal requirement for restaurants to pass on tips to staff Its a fact thats covered in a governmentled review released in May 2016 in which workers employers and customers were asked their views on the tipping process Off the back of it ministers said they were keen to change rules and make sure lowpaid workers get the money left for them by grateful customers The government have announced a twomonth consultation on proposals that they said would stamp out unfairness Among the reviews revelations was the fact that some waiters are charged up to a 15 administration fee on tips they are left by credit or debit cards In some restaurants the government has seen evidence of waiters being forced to hand over their own cash if they dont collect enough tips to cover these fees The government said it would consider prohibiting employers from charging workers an admin fee or any other deductions The government also said that it wanted customers to know that tips are voluntary calling for the system to be made more transparent with restaurants clearly displaying their tips policy We asked waiters around the UK what they think of the tipping process including how much they take home from tips and whether its fair and what would improve it for them 1 Rodri 37 London Around 50 of a waiters income is tips Average tips 60 per eighthour shift I think they treat waiters best in the US Everything has got fairer since the tipping scandal was exposed in the summer of 2015 This is when it was revealed that dozens of restaurants were exposed for skimming tips from staff for administration fees However you still hear horror stories from new employees at some chains Ive heard of restaurants not paying their chefs a share of the tronc a payment arrangement used to distribute tips Some restaurants will take 4 of all sales to pay the chefs and as an admin fee So if you sell 1000 worth of food the company will take 40 This is regardless of how much you make in tips This means that if a table has a 100 bill and doesnt tip the waiter has to pay 4 of their own money This leads to a moneygrabbing culture and ironically to bad service If a table doesnt tip the waiter feels as if they are being robbed by the company and ends up resenting the customers I can average around 60 in tips per shift but on a good night this goes up to over 100 and on a poor night its around 40 Around 50 of a waiters income is tips All restaurants should have to publicly state their exact tipping procedure America has it pretty good everyone tips 2 Elle 22 Edinburgh We never know whether its fair Average tips 20 per eighthour shift I think they treat waiters best in France I work three jobs all on parttime zerohours contracts in catering and hospitality My main day job is in a cafe where the small number of staff work both front of house and in the kitchen so all our tips get put in a pot and shared equally My main evening job is at a restaurant where we dont get our tips but our wages are minimum wage plus an extra 250 per hour which apparently has been worked out to account for average tips when shared with the kitchen staff My third job is events catering and nobody ever tips In restaurants because a lot of customers add tips through card payments the staff never actually see how much is getting tipped so we dont know whether were getting our fair share or not The system seems better in France where they dont tip much but waiting tables is seen as a proper job offering job security and a decent income 3 Ashley 22 London Tips go towards customer breakages Average tips 1015 per eighthour shift I think they treat waiters best in Australia I work in a southeast London pub in the evenings and I do day shifts at a local restaurant In both places tips are all collected and shared out at the end of the night Money is also taken from the tip jar to cover breakages by either staff or customers If a member of the team gets off early they will rarely see their tips because they are shared out just before the pub closes It is incredibly unfair that our tips are shared out especially when one member of the team underperforms Equally when a member of the team does incredibly well they dont get what theyve earned Its really unfair that tips go towards breakages made by customers The managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without docking our tips I make around 20 a shift but would only be given 1015 of that money When I am tipped well the tips hugely impact on my nances Occasionally I will earn over 50 in one night which almost doubles my earnings for that day However I never get more than 30 of that money after it has been shared out I really rely on tips because I am only paid 7 an hour Id rather we earned a good basic wage like in Australia and therefore didnt have to rely on tips to make ends meet 4 Tom Manchester A big night of tips can help pay the rent Average tips 40 per eighthour shift I think they treat waiters best in Italy Where I used to work oor staff kept 80 of cash tips and 40 of card tips The other 20 of cash went into a pot for the commis waiters and service bar The 60 went into a tronc system which helped boost kitchen salaries Im not actually sure if this was to help pay the agreed salary or provide bonuses Its hard to say how much I earned a shift maybe around 40 20 from card tips It can make a massive change to your weekly nances Sometimes people needed a big night to be able to pay their rent They have got tipping right in Italy where people dont add a service charge but usually round up their bill so if they get a meal for 19 they leave a 20 note and dont ask for change They respect the staff and you often see people making a career out of waiting and the experience shows,Introduction Did you know that in the UK there is no legal requirement for restaurants to pass on tips to staff For a new government report workers

around 60 of tips per shift On a good night this can go up to over 100 and on a poor night its around 40 Around 50 of a waiters income is tips All restaurants should have to publicly state their exact tipping policy America has it pretty good everyone tips 2 Elle 22 Edinburgh We never know whether its fair Average tips 20 per eighthour shift I think they treat waiters best in France I have three parttime catering jobs My main day job is in a cafe where the small number of staff work both in the cafe and in the kitchen so all our tips go in a pot and they are shared equally My main evening job is at a restaurant where we dont get our tips but our wages are minimum wage plus an extra 250 per hour My third job is events catering and nobody ever tips In restaurants because a lot of customers add tips through card payments the staff never see how much the tip is so we dont know whether what we get is fair or not The system seems better in France where they dont tip much but being a waiter is seen as a proper job with job security and a decent income 3 Ashley 22 London Tips go towards customer breakages Average tips 1015 per eighthour shift I think they treat waiters best in Australia I work in a London pub in the evenings and I do day shifts at a local restaurant In both places all the tips are collected and shared out at the end of the night Money is also taken from the tips to pay for breakages by either staff or customers It is incredibly unfair that our tips are shared out especially when one member of the team doesnt work hard enough Or when a member of the team does incredibly well they dont get what theyve earned Its really unfair that tips go towards breakages made by customers The managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without taking our tips I make around 20 a shift in tips but often I only get 1015 of that money I really rely on tips because I am only paid 7 an hour Id rather we earned a good basic wage like in Australia and didnt have to rely on tips 4 Tom Manchester A big night of tips can help pay the rent Average tips 40 per eighthour shift I think they treat waiters best in Italy Where I used to work waiters kept 80 of cash tips and 40 of card tips The other 20 of cash went into a pot for the commis waiters and bar staff The 60 from the card tips went to the kitchen staff Its hard to say how much I earned a shift maybe around 40 It can make a massive change to your weekly nances Sometimes the waiters needed a good night to pay their rent They have got tipping right in Italy where customers dont add a service charge but usually round up their bill so if their meal is 19 they leave a 20 note and dont ask for change They respect the staff In Italy people often make a career as a waiter and the experience these waiters have shows in the service the customers get,train,ADV,INT

20,The National Security Agency NSA has obtained direct access to the systems of Google Facebook Apple and other US internet giants according to a topsecret document The NSA access is part of a previously undisclosed program called PRISM which allows officials to collect material including search history the content of emails file transfers and live chats the document says The Guardian has verified the authenticity of the document a 41slide PowerPoint presentation classified as top secret with no distribution to foreign allies which was apparently used to train intelligence operatives on the capabilities of the program The document claims collection directly from the servers of major US service providers Although the presentation claims the program is run with the assistance of the companies all those who responded to a request for comment denied knowledge of any such program In a statement Google said Google cares deeply about the security of our users data We disclose user data to government in accordance with the law and we review all such requests carefully From time to time people allege that we have created a government back door into our systems but Google does not have a back door for the government to access private user data Several senior tech executives insisted that they had no knowledge of PRISM or of any similar scheme They said they would never have been involved in such a program If they are doing this they are doing it without our knowledge one said An Apple spokesman said he had never heard of PRISM The NSA access was enabled by changes to US surveillance law introduced under President Bush and renewed under Obama in December 2012 The program facilitates extensive indepth surveillance on live communications and stored information The law allows for the targeting of any customers of participating firms who live outside the US or those Americans whose communications include people outside the US It also opens the possibility of communications made entirely within the US being collected without warrants Disclosure of the PRISM program follows a leak to the Guardian on Wednesday of a topsecret court order compelling telecoms provider Verizon to turn over the telephone records of millions of US customers The participation of the internet companies in PRISM will add to the debate about the scale of surveillance by the intelligence services Unlike the collection of those call records this surveillance can include the content of communications and not just the metadata Some of the worlds largest internet brands are claimed to be part of the informationsharing program since its introduction in 2007 Microsoft which is currently running an advertising campaign with the slogan Your privacy is our priority was the first with collection beginning in December 2007 It was followed by Yahoo in 2008 Google Facebook and PalTalk in 2009 YouTube in 2010 Skype and AOL in 2011 and finally Apple which joined the program in 2012 The program is continuing to expand with other providers due to come online Collectively the companies cover the vast majority of online email search video and communications networks The extent and nature of the data collected from each company varies Companies are legally obliged to comply with requests for users communications under US law but the PRISM program allows the intelligence services direct access to the companies servers The NSA document notes the operations have the assistance of communications providers in the US The revelation also supports concerns raised by several US senators during the renewal of the FISA Amendments Act FAA in December 2012 who warned about the scale of surveillance the law might enable and shortcomings in the safeguards it introduces When the FAA was first enacted defenders of the statute argued that a significant check on abuse would be the NSAs inability to obtain electronic communications without the consent of the telecom and internet companies that control the data But the PRISM program renders that consent unnecessary as it allows the agency to directly and unilaterally seize the communications off the companies servers A chart prepared by the NSA contained within the topsecret document highlights the breadth of the data it is able to obtain email video and voice chat videos photos voiceoverIP Skype for example chats file transfers social networking details and more The document is recent dating to April 2013 Such a leak is extremely rare in the history of the NSA which prides itself on maintaining a high level of secrecy The PRISM program allows the NSA the worlds largest surveillance organization to obtain targeted communications without having to request them from the service providers and without having to obtain individual court orders With this program the NSA is able to reach directly into the servers of the participating companies and obtain both stored communications and perform realtime collection on targeted users A senior administration official said in a statement The Guardian and Washington Post articles refer to collection of communications pursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act FISA This law does not allow the targeting of any US citizen or of any person located within the United States The program is subject to oversight by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court the Executive Branch and Congress It involves extensive procedures specifically approved by the court to ensure that only nonUS persons outside the US are targeted and that minimize the acquisition retention and dissemination of incidentally acquired information about US persons This program was recently reauthorized by Congress after extensive hearings and debate Information collected under this program is among the most important and valuable intelligence information we collect and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats,According to a topsecret document the National Security Agency NSA has got direct access to the systems of Google Facebook Apple and other major US internet companies The NSA access

54,SeaWorld has suffered an 84 collapse in pro ts as customers have deserted the controversial aquatic theme park company following claims it mistreated orca whales The company which trains dolphins and killer whales to perform tricks in front of stadiums full of spectators has reported declines in attendance sales and pro ts because of continued brand challenges SeaWorld has been in the headlines since the 2013 documentary Black sh detailed claims that its treatment of orca whales provoked violent behaviour contributing to the deaths of three people Following the release of the documentary attendance collapsed the company lost more than half of its market value on Wall Street and its former CEO was forced out The company has since launched a nationwide marketing campaign to combat animal rights activists claims that among other things captive orcas die at a younger age than their wild counterparts Despite cutting ticket prices and spending 10m on the marketing blitz which features its veterinarians caring for whales SeaWorld CEO Joel Manby was forced to admit that the company is still struggling to convince the public that it treats its whales well We realize we have much work ahead of us to recover more of our attendance base increase revenue and improve our performance as returning to historical performance levels will take time and investment Manby said On the reputation side early feedback on our campaign has been positive However we recognize that fully resolving our brand challenges in California will require sustained focus and commitment to correct misinformation We will continue to ght with the facts because the facts are on our side he said recently on a conference call with journalists and analysts Manby who joined the company as CEO in 2015 to help the company rehabilitate itself said he would set out his vision for the future of the company at a special event on 6 November Already in the pipeline are plans for a new shark exhibition in Orlando and an attraction in San Antonio that will allow customers to swim with dolphins in a naturalistic setting The companys nancial report released on 6 August showed net income in the second

watching SeaWorlds sales and attendance numbers in the third quarter which is traditionally the companys most pro table and covers the summer holiday season Attendance may suffer from a fresh scandal in July 2015 in which a SeaWorld employee was alleged to have in ltrated animal rights protest groups against the company Jared Goodman director of animal law for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals PETA which has been leading campaigns against SeaWorld said SeaWorld is in the midst of a spying scandal animals are dying in its tanks and tens of thousands of people have opposed its bid to build a new orca prison so it should come as no surprise that SeaWorlds quarterly earnings have plummeted yet again in the second quarter Families just dont want to buy tickets to see orcas going

90,Valdevaqueros is one of the last remaining unspoilt beaches in southern Spain where the sky above the golden sands is filled with kites hauling surfers over the waves Currently the beach has little more than an access road lined with camper vans from Germany France Italy and Britain filled with windsurfers and kitesurfers lured by the areas strong winds For decades it has been a world apart from the concretelined beaches of Torremolinos and Marbella along the coast yet on 29 May the local council in Tarifa approved plans to build a tourist complex right next to the beach with 1400 hotel rooms and 350 flats Environmental and conservation groups have protested that the project will harm the habitats of protected species but for most councillors here the issue is simple jobs In this town of 18000 inhabitants 2600 are out of work as Spain faces its worst economic crisis in at least half a century one that has cast doubt on the future of the euro Traditional sources of income such as fishing are dying out now that fleets are being dismantled and fish stocks are depleted so tourism is the only way out as long as it is sustainable said Sebastin Galindo a councillor from the Socialist Party which is in opposition in Tarifa but voted with the governing Peoples Party to give the project the green light Tarifas Mayor Juan Andrs Gil declined to comment on the project but Galindo said it complies with environmental standards The complex would be 800 metres from the coast comfortably beyond the minimum of 200 metres stipulated by a law designed to prevent more ugly developments like those that blighted much of Spains coastline when mass tourism first descended on its shores in the 1960s and 1970s Opponents of the complex say the last thing anyone needs is more housing in a country that already has a million empty homes although the central government last week proposed a selloff by granting nonSpaniards residency permits in return for buying property worth at least 160000 The Socialist opposition in Madrid attacked the proposal and Galindo said it discriminated against migrant workers who flocked to Spain during the boom years many of them from Morocco whose coastline is just 14km away and can be seen from Tarifa It favours moneyed classes rather than those who came here to help Spain get ahead he said Surfers fear that new buildings in Valdevaqueros would reduce the strength of the famous local Levant wind but fail to lure traditional package holidaymakers Its not really a family spot Just wait until they see what a Levant is like said Henning Mayer who has regularly made the journey from Augsburg in Germany for 20 years Ten years ago they said they would build a new highway here It didnt happen so I think it will be impossible to build new hotels At the southernmost tip of Spain Tarifa is the strategic crossroads between Africa and Europe where the Mediterranean Sea meets the Atlantic Campaigners say it also has a vital role in the animal world as a crossroads for migrating species The campaign to save the beach was launched hours after the Tarifa council voted for the project The campaign has a Facebook page and is supported by groups including Greenpeace the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Spanish branch of conservation network Birdlife Its the environmental equivalent of putting a shopping centre right in the middle of the Alhambra said Noelia Jurado who uses her multimedia expertise to campaign against the complex She also noted that the resort would be near the ancient Roman town of Baelo Claudia They could be building on top of more Roman ruins here Nobody knows Also joining the opposition to the planned resort is the Andalusian College of Geographers which in a preliminary study charted on its website concluded that free areas including car parks if not actual buildings will overlap part of the Alcornocales National Park The geographers also estimate that the site intrudes on two wildlife conservation areas One of the areas in Valdevaqueros is home to two species of bat whose survival is threatened Money is once again being put before urban laws and European environmental directives said Ral Romeva a member of the European Parliament who is VicePresident of the Greens group In Romevas view the project is also at fault because the proposed site has too little water in a town that already suffers from shortages in the summer weather that scorches the southern Spanish region of Andalusa Lack of water recently led the Andalusa Supreme Court to uphold an appeal against plans to build a complex elsewhere in the region which would have included golf courses hotels and luxury homes Many locals are also wondering why a resort should be built 10km away rather than on wasteland near Tarifas picturesque old centre with its typically Andalusian whitewashed walls and winding streets dominated by a 10thcentury Moorish castle My opinion and that of catering workers is that we agree with the complex as long as it creates jobs in the town which is what is needed but we are against it being for the benefit of a few said Cristbal Lobato who has worked at the same beachside bar in Tarifa for 30 years If they put it in the centre of Tarifa where there is space then clients could visit shops tapas bars and restaurants Overlooking the green fields earmarked for building biologist Aitor Galn who conducts environmental impact studies for a living pointed at one of only two seaside breeding grounds for vultures in Europe Anywhere else in Europe this place would have the utmost protection but here they want to get rid of it all and cover it with buildings he said What they want to do is turn this into Benidorm but what draws people here is wildlife and the wind But by taking advantage of the current crisis and unemployment builders and mayors who agree with them can justify any amount of destruction,Valdevaqueros is one of the last unspoilt beaches in southern Spain Currently the beach just has an access road filled with camper vans from Germany France Italy and Britain which bring windsurfers and kitesurfers who are attracted by the strong winds in the area For years it has been very different from the concretelined beaches of Torremolinos and Marbella along the coast but earlier in 2012 the local council in Tarifa said yes to plans to build a tourist complex next to the beach Environmental and conservation groups have protested that the project will harm the habitats of protected species but for most of the council the issue is simple jobs Tarifa has 18000 inhabitants and 2600 are unemployed as Spain experiences its worst economic crisis in at least half a century Traditional jobs such as fishing are dying out so tourism is the only solution but it must be sustainable said Sebastin Galindo a councillor from the Socialist party which is in opposition in Tarifa but voted with the governing Peoples Party support the project Galindo says the complex meets environmental standards There is a law that was designed to stop more ugly developments like those that spoilt a lot of Spains beaches when mass tourism first arrived in the 1960s and 1970s This law says that the complex must be at least 200 metres from the coast it will be much farther than that it will be 800 metres Opponents of the complex say more housing is not needed in a country that already has a million empty homes The Socialist opposition in Madrid attacked the idea and Galindo said it discriminated against migrant workers who came to Spain during the boom years many of them from Morocco whose coastline is just 14km away and can be seen from Tarifa Surfers fear that new buildings in Valdevaqueros would reduce the strength of the famous local wind

has too little water in a town that already suffers from shortages in the hot summer weather of Andalusa Many locals are also wondering why a resort should be built 10km away and not on wasteland near

mission It seemed like I lived there forever Kelly said The veteran of past missions said that his biggest surprise was simply how long this one felt Maybe occasionally you do go bananas he said Kelly and a Russian counterpart Mikhail Kornienko spent nearly a year on the International Space Station ISS in order to study the effects of weightlessness radiation and the cramped quarters of space ight on humans research NASA considers essential for an eventual mission to Mars Kelly said the length of the mission was its biggest challenge and that he felt signi cantly more sore on returning to gravity than after shorter trips Kelly and his twin brother Mark a retired astronaut have spent the last year taking physical and mental tests The tests will continue to help NASA learn about how the body copes with the severe strains of space ight Kelly said he felt aches and had extremely sensitive skin but so far his balance has felt mostly decent However he said the rst thing I tried to throw on a table I missed because you tend to underestimate the effects of gravity He said the discomfort of returning to gravity which shrank him back down to normal height after he stretched by 15 inches in orbit took nothing away from the awe he felt after his capsule landed back on Earth When the Russian capsule opened on to the cool air of Kazakhstan Kelly said he smelled a fragrance like a plant was blooming in that area It was the fresh air mingled with the charred kind of sweet smell of a spacecraft that had survived reentry through the atmosphere Backing away from the vessel he said the scope of the mission began to sink in 340 days on a 15yearold space station which is a million pounds the size of a football eld the internal volume some say of a sixbedroom house The ISS he said is a place that uses the power of the sun and was built with the help of an international team and millions of taxpayers There are things were going to discover about our experience in space in the space station that we dont even know now Kelly said comparing the research of more than 450 missions there to the work done by computer scientists at NASA in the 1960s and 1970s He added The view is great too Kelly made the most of that view posting spectacular photos on social media of the Earths cities landscapes oceans and atmosphere The Earth is a beautiful planet he said describing the striking

actually owns them But predominantly you just notice how thin the atmosphere is how fragile it looks Kelly added That combined with these large swathes of pollution is kind of alarming The astronaut said he could see entire systems of pollution smoke clouds from wild res that covered parts of the US sections of Asia with continuous visible pollution nearly all year round He said the message we need to save the planet slightly missed the point The planet will get better its us that wont be here because well destroy the environment The worlds thin shield of atmosphere makes you more of an environmentalist after spending so much time looking down he said Its for us to take care of the air we breathe and the water we drink And I do believe we have an impact on that and we do have the ability to change it if we make the decision to Kellys active social media life which he said was a joint effort with his girlfriend earned him a huge online following But he said he was unaware of it instead he was watching the chaotic drama of the 2016 presidential election One of the rst questions he asked the crew who lifted him out of a space capsule was How did Super Tuesday go But the astronaut demurred when asked for his thoughts on the likes of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders I would say that as a government employee I am subject to the Hatch Act he said referring to a law that prohibits some political activity for federal employees So I cant say how I think of all the news stories of all the year Besides the news he said steady work helped keep him sane I tried to have milestones that were close like when is the next crew arriving the next spacewalk the next robotics the next science experiment That made a difference to me keeping my sanity Being back on Earth with the rest of humanity had not quite sunk in he added recalling how shocked he had been to see a crowd of people after a previous mission Therell be a point here pretty soon where Ill start feeling that kind of culture shock he said Although a NASA scientist said Kelly embodied the qualities needed for a mission to Mars the astronaut himself predicted that he would not y again with the space agency But I dont think I would ever say Im absolutely 100 done he added noting the sudden successes of private space ight companies such as SpaceX They might need a guy like me someday he said Maybe in the next 20 years youll be able to buy a cheap ticket just go for a little visit,Himalayan lakes spacewalks and the US presidential campaign helped Scott Kelly stay sane during his 340 days in space the astronaut told journalists after he landed back on Earth from a recordbreaking mission It seemed like I lived there forever Kelly said He had been on several previous missions but said that his biggest surprise was simply how long this one felt Maybe occasionally you do go bananas he said Kelly and a Russian colleague Mikhail Kornienko spent nearly a year on the International Space Station ISS in order to study the effects of weightlessness radiation and the cramped conditions of space ight on humans NASA considers this research essential for a future mission to Mars Kelly said the length of the mission was its biggest challenge and that he felt much more sore when he returned to gravity than after shorter trips Kelly and his twin brother Mark a retired astronaut have spent the last year taking physical and mental tests The tests will continue to help NASA learn about how the body copes with the severe strains of space ight He said the discomfort of returning to gravity took nothing from the sense of wonder he felt after he landed back on Earth When the Russian capsule opened on to the cool air of Kazakhstan Kelly said he smelled a fragrance like a plant was blooming in that area It was the fresh air mixed with the charred kind of sweet smell of a spacecraft that had survived reentry through the atmosphere As he left the spacecraft he said the importance of the mission began to sink in 340 days on a 15year old space station which is a million pounds the size of a football eld the internal volume some say of a sixbedroom house The ISS he said is a place that uses the power of the sun and was built with the help of an international team There are things were going to discover about our experience in space in the space station that we dont even know now Kelly said comparing the research of more than 450 missions there to the work done by computer scientists at NASA in the 1960s and 1970s He added The view is great too Kelly made the most of that view he posted spectacular photos on social media of the Earths cities landscapes oceans and atmosphere The Earth is a beautiful planet he said describing the beautiful waters around the Bahamas and the rainbow colours of the lakes of the northern Himalayas He said he would like to visit that region though he would rst need to learn what country actually owns them But mainly you just notice how thin the atmosphere is Kelly added That together with these large areas of pollution is kind of alarming The astronaut said he could see entire systems of pollution smoke clouds from wild res that covered

14,Health warnings covering nearly twothirds of cigarette packs and a ban on menthol cigarettes across the EU have come a step nearer following a vote in the European Parliament Menthol and other flavours will be banned from 2022 but in a blow to the UK government MEPs decided that most electronic cigarettes increasingly popular as alternatives to tobacco products need not be regulated in the same way as medicines Health officials and the ecigarette industry in Britain are seeking to clarify what this means for instance whether companies in the fastexpanding market face the same bans on sponsorship and promotion at sports events as tobacco firms The Department of Health would not comment on the advertising issue until officials had studied the MEPs decisions But in a statement the DH said We are very pleased to see the move towards tougher action on tobacco with Europewide controls banning flavoured cigarettes and the introduction of stricter rules on frontofpack health warnings However we are disappointed with the decision to reject the proposal to regulate nicotinecontaining products NCPs including ecigarettes as medicines We believe these products need to be regulated as medicines and will continue to make this point during further negotiations Figures show smoking levels in England are at their lowest since records began 195 per cent but we are determined to further reduce rates of smoking and believe this important step will help The UK ecigarette industry which broadly welcomed the parliaments vote said it was already in talks with the Advertising Standards Authority but added that it would not be sensible proportionate reasonable or useful to ban all advertising MEPs decided ecigarettes should only be regulated as medical products if manufacturers claimed they could prevent tobacco smoking a decision criticized by the governments main medicines regulator They want to put the products used by an estimated 13 million people in Britain by 2014 on the same legal basis as gums patches and mouth sprays aimed at helping smokers to quit but the industry says the expensive process of licensing would help force alternatives to tobacco off the shelves The MEPs voted to put health warnings on 65 of each cigarette pack as opposed to a proposed 75 At present the warnings cover at least 30 on the front and 40 on the back The UK government has delayed a decision on whether to follow Australia by introducing standardized packaging until there is evidence that such measures cut tobacco use The MEPs votes in the first reading of the draft tobacco directive which could become law in 2014 will be followed by negotiations with the EU Council of Ministers The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority had already invited manufacturers to cooperate by opting for voluntary regulation in June 2013 in advance of what it still hopes will be compulsory across Europe The legislative process is still not complete and there will be further negotiation The UK continues to believe that medicinal regulation of NCPs is the best way to deliver a benefit to public health said a spokesman Linda McAvan Labour MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber and spokesperson on tobacco issues for the parliaments Socialists Democrats group said We know that it is children not adults who start smoking And despite the downward trend in most member states of adult smokers the World Health Organization figures show worrying upward trends in a number of our member states of young smokers We need to stop tobacco companies targeting young people with an array of gimmicky products and we need to make sure that cigarette packs carry effective warnings Martin Callanan the Conservative MEP for North East England said Forcing ecigs off the shelves would have been totally crazy These are products that have helped countless people stop smoking more harmful cigarettes and yet some MEPs wanted to make them harder to manufacture than ordinary tobacco Katherine Devlin president of ECITA the ecigarette industry association said the really important decision by MEPs not to support medicines regulation meant that was now off the table British American Tobacco claimed the larger health warnings demanded by MEPs went well beyond what was needed to inform consumers of health risks from smoking while a ban on mentholated cigarettes would increase demand for blackmarket goods,Health warnings that cover nearly twothirds of cigarette packs and a ban on menthol cigarettes in the EU have come a step nearer after a vote in the European Parliament Menthol and

Facebook prepares to update investors on its performance in the first three months of the year with analysts forecasting revenues up 36 on last year studies suggest that its expansion in the US UK and other major European countries has peaked In the last month the worlds largest social network has lost 6m US visitors a 4 fall according to analysis firm Socialbakers In the UK 14m fewer users checked

Germany and Japan where Facebook has some of its biggest followings A spokeswoman for Facebook declined to comment The problem is that in the US and UK most people who want to sign up for Facebook have already done it said new media specialist Ian Maude at Enders Analysis There is a boredom factor where people like to try something new Is Facebook going to go the way of MySpace The risk is relatively small but that is not to say it isnt there Alternative social networks such as Instagram the photosharing site that won 30m users in 18 months before Facebook acquired the business have seen surges in popularity with younger age groups Path the mobile phonebased social network founded by former Facebook employee Dave Morin which restricts its users to 150 friends is gaining 1m users

front of personal computers is declining rapidly because we are switching our screen time to smartphones and tablets While smartphone minutes have doubled in a year to 69 a month that growth is not guaranteed to compensate for dwindling desktop usage Facebook is the most authoritative source on its own user numbers and the firm will update investors on its performance for the quarter Wall Street

101,On one day in August one in seven people on Earth 1 billion people used Facebook according to founder Mark Zuckerberg In a decade the social network has transformed peoples relationships privacy their businesses news media helped topple regimes and even changed the meanings of everyday words A more open and connected world is a better world It brings stronger relationships with those you love a stronger economy with more opportunities and a stronger society that re ects all of our values wrote Zuckerberg in the post announcing the numbers These are just some of the ways his company changed everything for better or worse 1 Facebook has changed the de nition of friend To friend is now a verb And unlike in real life when the ending of a friendship can be deeply traumatic it is easy to unfriend a word invented to describe ditching a casual acquaintance when they are no longer enhancing your Facebook newsfeed Although the meanings of the words share and like are essentially the same Facebook has brought an entirely new weight to the terms School and university reunions have become redundant you already know whose career is going well whether the perfect pair have split and youve seen endless pictures of your schoolmates babies You wont be surprised by an ex in the street with a new girlfriend or boyfriend you already know theyre dating someone else from the romantic sel es But unlike in real life Facebook has no hierarchy of friendships A classmate from one project at university who you havent seen in 15 years a friendofafriend from a stag do or a colleague youve never actually spoken to in person they are all Facebook friends in the same way as your closest mate or your spouse or your mum It doesnt necessarily mean we see them the same way Professor Robin Dunbar is famous for his research that suggests a person can only have roughly 150 people as a social group Facebook hasnt changed that yet he believes but in an interview with the New Yorker Dunbar said he feared it was so easy simply to end friendships on Facebook that eventually there may no longer be any need to learn to get along 2 We care less about privacy Theres a wise saying if youre not paying for it youre the product Facebook embodies that philosophy and created an entire industry from it The astonishing thing is that users know that and they willingly hand over that information Pew Research Center found that most young people are more than willing to hand over their details An overwhelming majority of 91 post a photo of themselves 71 post the city or town where they live up from 61 more than half give email addresses and a fth give their phone number But as so much of a persons life is shared online Facebook gives a platform for everyone to cultivate an image and a fanbase In an article for the journal Frontiers in Psychology academics described a new phenomenon the emergence of the Facebook self More than 80 list their interests allowing brands to target them most effectively But most younger users do restrict their pro les with 60 allowing friends only 3 Facebook has created millions of jobs but not in its own of ces Facebook has essentially created an entire sector including indirect employment for people whose job it is to make the platform work for their brand It is a tool like no other said Michael Tinmouth a social media strategist who has worked with brands such as Vodafone and Microsoft Marketers have an understanding of a brands consumers like they have never had before The data and analytics available to you are extraordinary You know who your customers are who they are friends with and how they engage with your brand And advertisers pay a lot for that Facebook reported ad revenue was up 46 reaching 332bn Facebook is also a mine eld for brands Suddenly rather than complaint conversations taking place over the phone with a customer service representative or on a small specialist internet forum angry customers can post their complaints for hundreds of their friends to see or even on the page where all loyal fans of the brand have been carefully cultivated And an injustice can go viral 4 Facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions Though the Arab Spring was dubbed the Twitter revolution organizing demonstrations and direct action has been revolutionized by Facebook Manchester Universitys Olga Onuch found Facebook had been the key medium for reaching half of all the Euromaidan protesters in Ukraine Facebook posts signalled the start of the Maidan protests during the hours after it was announced that Ukraine would not sign a free trade and association agreement with the EU Onuch found The posts organized live action not just online anger Mustafa Nayyem the Ukraine activist posted If you really want to do something dont just like this post Lets meet near the monument to independence in the middle of the Maidan Many of those interviewed in Onuchs research said they relied on Facebook for the truth about what was happening unable to trust traditional media 5 Facebook makes news breaks news and decides what is news Roughly 71 of 18 to 24yearolds say the internet is their main news source and 63 of users overall according to the Pew Research Center About a third of Facebook users post about politics and government Most people will rst encounter a piece of journalism or an item of breaking news via Facebook or other social media and most of those encounters will be on mobiles Users might never have to leave the site to get their news Instant Articles will see stories run within Facebook It allows news companies to sell ads around their articles gaining them 100 of that revenue while Facebook can also sell ads around that article with 70 of the revenue from the social networks advertising also going to the news companies Facebook has also changed the ways journalists write stories It is a resource many reporters cannot now live without For better or often worse it is a directory to nd contact and glean information for almost any ordinary person who might suddenly nd themselves at the centre of the days biggest news story Facebook has its own newswire sharing the most useful user reaction to breaking stories including pictures and videos 6 Users are changing Facebook It used to be a site to get students connected with only elite US universities allowed access In 2014 a decade after its launch 56 of internet users aged 65 and older have a Facebook account And 39 are connected to people they have never met in person Groups have given way to pages writing on each others walls is passe and carefully curated albums have given way to instant mobile uploads More than ever the site is a gateway not just to your friends but to the rest of the internet We may as

68,Not just the identity of the man in the car park with the twisted spine but the appalling last moments and humiliating treatment of the naked body of Richard III in the hours after his death have been revealed at an extraordinary press conference at Leicester University There were cheers when Richard Buckley Lead Archaeologist on the hunt for the kings body finally announced that the university team was convinced beyond reasonable doubt that it had found the last Plantagenet king bent by scoliosis of the spine and twisted further to fit into a hastily dug hole in Grey Friars church which was slightly too small to hold his body But by then it was clear the evidence was overwhelming as the scientists who carried out the DNA tests those who created the computerimaging technology to peer onto and into the bones in extraordinary detail the genealogists who found a distant descendant with matching DNA and the academics who scoured contemporary texts for accounts of the kings death and burial outlined their findings What a morning What a story said Philippa Langley of the Richard III Society She had been driving on the project for years in the face of incredulity from many people and finding funds from all over the world when it looked as if the money would run out before the excavation had even begun Work has started on designing a new tomb in Leicester Cathedral only 100 yards from the excavation site and a ceremony will be held to lay him into his new grave there probably next year Leicesters Museums Service is working on plans for a new visitor centre in an old school building overlooking the site Richard died at Bosworth on 22 August 1485 the last English king to fall in battle and the researchers revealed how for the first time There was an audible intake of breath as a slide came up showing the base of his skull sliced off by one terrible blow believed to be from a halberd a fearsome medieval battle weapon with a razorsharp iron axe blade weighing about two kilos mounted on a wooden pole which was swung at Richard at very close range The blade probably penetrated several centimetres into his brain and said the human bones expert Jo Appleby he would have been unconscious at once and dead almost as soon The injury appears to confirm contemporary accounts that he died in close combat in the thick of the battle and unhorsed as in the great despairing cry Shakespeare gives him A horse A horse My kingdom for a horse Another sword slash which also went through the bone and into the brain would also have proved fatal But many of the other injuries were after death suggesting a gruesome ritual on the battlefield and as the kings body was brought back to Leicester as he was stripped mocked and mutilated One terrible injury a stab through the right buttock and into his pelvis was certainly after death and could not have happened when his lower body was protected by armour It suggests the story that his naked corpse was brought back slung over a horse mocked and abused all the way is true Bob Savage a medieval arms expert from the Royal Armouries who helped identify the wounds said it was probably not a war weapon but the sort of sharp knife or dagger any workman might have carried Michael Ibsen the Canadianborn furniture maker proved to be the descendant of Richards sister heard the confirmation on Sunday and listened to the unfolding evidence in shocked silence My head is no clearer now than when I first heard the news he said Many many hundreds of people died on that field that day He was a king but just one of the dead He lived in very violent times and these deaths would not have been pretty or quick It was Mathew Morris who first uncovered the body in the first hour of the first day of the excavation He did not believe he had found the king The mechanical digger was still chewing the tarmac off the council car park identified by years of research by local historians and the Richard III Society as the probable site of the lost church of Grey Friars whose priests bravely claimed the body of the king and buried him in a hastily dug grave probably still naked but in a position of honour near the high altar of their church The leg bones just showing through the soil were covered up again Ten days later on 5 September when further excavation proved Morris had hit the crucial spot he returned with Lin Foxhall head of the archaeology department to excavate the body We did it the usual way lifting the arms legs and skull first and proceeding gradually towards the torso so it was only when we finally saw the twisted spine that I thought My word I think weve got him As far as Langley is concerned Richard was the true king the last king of the north a worthy and brave leader who became a victim of some of the most brilliant propaganda in history in the hands of the Tudors imagemaker Shakespeare There remains the dark shadow of the little princes in the tower an infamous story even in Richards day the child Edward V and his brother Richard were declared illegitimate when Richard III claimed the throne imprisoned in the Tower of London and never seen alive again Although it is by no means certain that the bones found at the tower centuries later are theirs there may be more DNA detective work to be done there,An extraordinary press conference at Leicester University has revealed the identity of the man in the car park with the twisted spine It has also revealed his appalling last moments and the humiliating treatment of his body in the hours after his death There

carried out the DNA tests those who created the computerimaging technology to examine the bones in extraordinary detail the genealogists who found a distant descendant with matching DNA and the

the excavation site and a ceremony will be held to lay him into his new grave there probably next year Leicesters Museums Service is working on plans for a new visitor centre in an old school building overlooking the site Richard died at Bosworth on 22 August 1485 the last English king to die in battle and for the first time the researchers revealed how There was an intake of breath as a picture showed the base of his skull sliced off by one terrible hit probably from a razorsharp iron axe blade on a wooden pole The blade probably went several centimetres into his brain and experts say he was certainly unconscious at once and dead almost as soon The injury confirms the story that he died in the middle of the battle and without his horse as in his cry in Shakespeares play A horse A horse My kingdom for a horse Another cut from a sword which also went through the bone and into the brain would also have been fatal But many of the other injuries were after death suggesting that the kings naked body was mutilated as it was brought back to Leicester One terrible injury was certainly after death and could not have happened when his lower body was protected by armour It suggests the story that his naked body was brought back on a horse and humiliated all the way is true Bob Savage a medieval weapons expert said it was probably not a war weapon but the sort of sharp knife or dagger any workman might have carried Michael Ibsen the Canadianborn furniture maker proved to be the descendant of Richards sister heard the confirmation on Sunday and listened to the evidence in shocked silence My head is no clearer now than when I first heard the news he said Many many hundreds of people died on that field that day He was a king but just one of the dead He lived in very violent times and these deaths would not have been pretty or quick It was Mathew Morris who first uncovered the body in the first hour of the first day of the excavation He did not believe he had found the king The mechanical digger was still removing the tarmac from the car park a place identified by years of research by local historians and the Richard III Society as the probable site of the lost church of Grey Friars The priests of Grey Friars bravely took the body of the king and buried him in a hastily dug grave probably still naked but in a position of honour near the high altar of their church The leg bones which were just showing through the soil were covered up again Ten days later on 5 September when further excavation proved Morris had hit the crucial spot he returned with Lin Foxhall head of the archaeology department to excavate the body We did it the usual way lifting the arms legs and skull first and proceeding gradually towards the torso so it was only when we finally saw the twisted spine that I thought My word I think weve got him For Philippa Langley of the Richard III Society Richard was the true king the last king of the north a brave leader who became a victim of some of the most brilliant propaganda in history in the hands of Shakespeare There remains the dark shadow of the little princes in the tower an infamous story even in Richards day the child Edward V and his brother Richard were declared illegitimate when Richard III claimed the throne imprisoned in the Tower of London and never seen alive again Although it is not certain that the bones found at the tower centuries later are theirs there may be more DNA detective work to be done there,train,ADV,INT
77,When it comes to climate change we have the bad habit of focusing on the rst part of the story the part about the problem and forgetting the second part about the many available solutions These solutions are speeding up recycling slowing down emissions and providing sustainable alternatives to plastic air conditioning smartphones and fast fashion The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently gathered in Copenhagen to present its latest report on the impacts and pace of climate change Climate change is now measured on all continents and our efforts to lower emissions must be intensi ed to avoid it escalating out of control Along with outlining the risks and challenges Copenhagen also embraced and focused on the solutions In the spirit of focusing on what can be done Sustainia Award chaired by Arnold Schwarzenegger celebrated ten leading sustainability solutions deployed in 84 countries From food to fashion energy to transportation education to health the awards showcased an alternative to the grimfuture scenarios we are so often presented with and made sustainability tangible to the innovators investors consumers and policy makers across sectors and regions From California we saw how we can now produce plastics from greenhouse gases that are competitive with normal oilbased plastics in price and quality From Switzerland we learned how we can recycle and reuse old clothes and shoes more effectively in a recycle system currently deployed in over 60 countries And from Canada we learned how smartphones can make bike sharing more convenient The ten projects presented each offered unique solutions to sustainability challenges but it was the Nigerian initiative Wecyclers that won Arnold Schwarzeneggers and the rest of jurys vote and took the Sustainia Award 2014 Wecyclers enables lowincome communities to make money on waste piling up in their streets By deploying a eet of cargo bicycles to collect and recycle unmanaged waste in Lagos Wecyclers lets families exchange garbage for consumer goods via an SMSbased point system Recycling companies purchase Wecyclers sorted waste for reprocessing into products they turn it into mattresses pillows and trash bags Wecyclers is a response to local waste issues where its estimated that only 40 of the citys rubbish is collected According to the World Bank only 46 of municipal solid waste in Africa is collected More than 5000 households have signed up so far and there are plans to extend the initiative to other cities throughout Nigeria Solutions to combat climate change are often perceived as hitech innovations focused on cutting emissions creating infrastructure or ef ciency However to successfully solve the variety of challenges we need variety in our solutions as well Sustainability is not solely a matter of bringing down emissions it is also a question of using our natural resources more intelligently and creating healthier lives for ourselves Initiatives might be lowtech in innovation but highimpact when it comes to creating sustainable change for entire communities With a wide range of solutions addressing the equally wide range of challenges we must focus

165,From all across Rwanda and even parts of neighbouring Burundi people ock to the southern town of Butare to a little shop called Inzozi Nziza Sweet Dreams They come for a taste of the unknown something most have never tasted the sweet cold velvety embrace of ice cream Here at the central African countrys rst ice cream parlour customers can buy scoops in sweet cream passion fruit strawberry and pineapple avours Toppings include fresh fruit honey chocolate chips and granola Black tea and coffee are also on sale The shop which has ice cream coffee dreams across its signage is milking local curiosity about the dessert and changing lives in the process says Inzozi Nzizas manager Louise Ingabire Ice cream is important she says between mouthfuls of a honey avoured offering Some Rwandans like ice cream but its a new thing We still have some work to do to tell others that theyll enjoy it True to Inzozi Nzizas motto the shop can certainly make dreams come true I didnt have a job before I just stayed at home Now I have a vision for the future I am making money and I can give some of it to my family says the 27yearold Butare which has 89600 residents and is located 135km south of the capital Kigali is the home of the National University of Rwanda Inzozi Nziza has become a hub for tired students looking to treat themselves to something cool and different Its something uniting people here Kalisa Migendo a 24yearold agriculture student says If you need to go out and talk to a friend a girl or a boy you come to Inzozi Nziza for an ice cream Most of the ingredients are sourced locally and the milk comes from a depot in nearby Nyanza The vanilla beans and cocoa are imported Inzozi Nziza was opened by the theatre director Odile Gakire Katese She met Alexis Miesen and Jennie Dundas cofounders of Blue Marble Ice Cream in Brooklyn New York and formed a partnership to open the shop in 2010 An icecream shop Katese proposed might help to put the human pieces back together by rebuilding spirits hopes and family traditions Miesen says At the start Miesen and Dundas owned the shop in partnership with its staff and had shares in the business which is a cooperative and nonpro t They did not set nancial targets but waited for 18 months before they transferred their shares to the women who had by then proved their business credentials The shops success is no exception says Fatuma Ndangiza deputy chief executive of the Rwanda Governance Board Small businesses are mostly managed by women but when it comes to big business where you have to compete for big tenders very few women are there Women are newcomers to big business she points out We have more women entrepreneurs Its an area where women are taking an interest both in and outside Kigali Though ice cream is somewhat new to Rwanda Ndangiza is enthused by the idea of the shop I think its great It requires a lot of skills and changing peoples mindsets because selling and eating ice cream is not part of our culture I think being able to innovate and introduce this on the market and the process of making it is quite interesting The Butare shop employs nine women who spend their spare time practising with Ingoma Nshya Rwandas rst and only female drumming troupe which was established by Katese ten years ago The musicians are Hutu and Tutsi women some survivors of the 1994 genocide during which almost a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed Some members of Ingoma Nshya are widows some orphans Others have been affected by the massacre in different ways Historically says Ingabire Rwandan women were forbidden to drum and many people considered the drums too heavy for women to carry But its something which brings unity Ingabires father two siblings and many cousins were killed in the genocide Some of us are survivors some know someone who was killed she says When Im drumming with them it gives me power because were still alive and survivors The popular eatery features in a documentary by Rob and Lisa Fruchtman sibling lmmakers Sweet Dreams which tells the story of how the women have forged a promising postgenocide future also includes the female drummers The lm which has been screened in more than a dozen countries including the US UK and several African states premieres in Rwanda in 2014 We feel the lm is about resilience hope bravery resourcefulness and the ability to change the

158,It has charted the worlds highest peaks the ocean floor the Amazon rainforest and even provided a glimpse into North Korea But Googles mission to map the world has largely steered clear of the inhospitable Arctic Now however the searchengine firm is embarking on what might be the most significant update to centuries of polar cartography and one it hopes will help provide a better understanding of life on the permafrost for millions of web users Google has flown a small team to Iqaluit the largest town in the Canadian territory of Nunavut armed with their warmest winter gear a stack of laptop computers and an 18kg backpackmounted telescopic camera Helped by an Inuit mapping expert and stalked by curious locals the team spent four days trudging through the terrain and collecting the images and information that will give the isolated community on the tundra of Baffin Island what urbanites across the globe now take for granted The town of 7000 people will go on display via Googles popular Street View application in July 2013 Aaron Brindle project leader said I live in Toronto and I absolutely take for granted that everything is where it should be and that this map is kind of my world but for so long that hasnt been the case in the north Unlike more populous and accessible parts of the world which have been mapped using a special camera mounted on a car roof the Iqaluit project had mappers hiking the towns snowpacked roads and traversing littleknown trails some of which are made of ice and disappear in the brief summer months The team also cut a path along part of a 15km culdesac known as the Road to Nowhere despite warnings about the risk from polar bears and other wildlife Mayor John Graham said the digital cartographers were however hunted by a herd of excited and curious locals or Google stalkers Graham understands the enthusiasm The Street View project he said follows in the footsteps of the English explorer Martin Frobisher who in 1576 sailed into the bay where Iqaluit now sits while searching for the Northwest Passage and the 1941 flight of Captain Elliott Roosevelt a reconnaissance officer and son of the US President which led to the site being chosen for a military airbase His exploration led to the founding of the modern town of Iqaluit which is the seat of government as well as a transport and communications hub for Nunavut One of the initial challenges Google faced was gathering the raw data needed to fill in their existing map What they had created using satellite images was fairly accurate although the rapid pace of the towns growth which has been fuelled by a mining boom meant they were missing one road that had been created in the past year said Arif Sayani the towns Director of Planning Another difficulty was how to situate many businesses and homeowners that have mail sent to the local post office rather than delivered to their address Plotting the PO box addresses would result in a map with firms banks and schools clustered around the Canada Post building in the centre of town About 30 Inuit elders entrepreneurs and highschool pupils turned out one night to help correct such problems They were provided with a laptop computer and instructed how to ensure their homes shops and meeting places would show up accurately on the map The project is more than a novelty or cultural philanthropy Sayani 32 said the town would be able to use the maps as a promotional tool for those thinking of visiting or moving to the area It may also speed up planning decisions that will affect Iqaluits growth The test run for the Iqaluit mapping exercise occurred last summer in Cambridge Bay a much smaller Nunavut town of about 1500 people located 1700km and a time zone west of Iqaluit The gravel roads and muddy puddles that can now be seen online however give little sense of life in a land usually covered in snow which is one reason why Google selected the lesshospitable month of March to travel to Iqaluit Brindle said he hoped to see the work continue in other northern towns though the high costs of shipping and airfares to move people and equipment around the vast Arctic territory appears to be weighing on Googles ambitions The next northern site has not yet been identified but when it is selected Brindle said the company might simply send one of its hitech backpacks and rely on volunteers to literally put themselves on the map Im hoping that three four five years from now well look back and see a very different map of Canadas north Brindle added,It has mapped the worlds highest peaks the ocean floor the Amazon rainforest and even shown us a bit of North Korea But Googles mission to map the world has mostly stayed away from the inhospitable Arctic Now however Google

30,Not nearly enough exercise classes have a tea break halfway through But Margaret Allens does After a gentle warmup and a few pulseraising numbers the 93yearold greatgrandmother lets her charges rehydrate with a cup of tea and a quick sit down Some of the eightstrong class look as if they need it more than others Allen herself wearing a thick turquoise shirt navy knitted waistcoat black slacks and sensible shoes has not broken into a sweat Despite an excruciating trapped nerve in one leg and a knee in need of replacement she looks as though she could go on for hours The general rule is that eating directly before sport is not the best idea let alone part way through But on the afternoon I visit Allens class at a church hall in SaltburnbytheSea near Middlesbrough slices of fruitcake are being passed around during the break The cake has been baked in honour of Allens recent birthday by her 89yearold sister Joan known locally as the scone queen of Saltburn The ladies have barely swallowed their last crumb when Allen is up again leading the group through a jaunty Scottish number involving lots of toe pointing and leg kicking Fortyfive minutes later the class is finally over Allen a former volunteer with the Red Cross has been leading classes in the northeast seaside town for 45 years Not particularly sporty at school she started playing the piano for a keepfit class during the second world war just for something to do during the blackouts really and eventually took over in her 40s when the previous instructor retired At its peak Allens class had more than 18 regulars each paying 1 a time But these days her flock is diminishing fast during the teabreak the ladies discuss a funeral that most of them had attended that week for one of the younger members of the group who had just died aged 68 from motor neurone disease Allen is the oldest followed by her sister The baby of the group is 60yearold Jean Cunion who credits the group with supporting her through a difficult time when her mother died She is somewhat embarrassed to admit that she is perhaps the least fit of the group I remember the first time I came Margaret said Whos that huffing and panting and I had to admit it was me Ruth Steere 76 marvels at how Allen never misses a trick despite always having her back to the class She always shouts at us if we go wrong Shes remarkably good at knowing what we are doing Allen a keen dancer has never done any formal training to be a fitness instructor Instead she choreographs her own moves based on five tapes from the BBCs first ever fitness guru Eileen Fowler who died in 2000 when she was 93 Allens age now Allen thinks her good health is largely down to keeping busy especially since her husband Joe died in 1997 She took up writing poetry when she was 80 I write poems about everything Im a prolific writer I just cant stop she says phoning me a few days after the interview to read out a ditty she has written about the joys of exercise One of the class 84yearold former teacher Winnie Robertson thinks the secret to staying fit is never letting yourself go Use it or lose it thats what I say Allen still plays the piano and gives speeches She is president of the Womens Fellowship at the local methodist church and is one of three 90plus year olds at the scrabble club of the University of the Third Age She did a computer course when she was 88 and tried to get online but it didnt work out Ageing is no fun she admits reading me a few lines from a poem she has written called That Beast Called Age She happily recalls a doctor who saw her for the first time a few years back who said she couldnt possibly be more than 78 I said Thank you doctor You can go now She also has a nononsense attitude to weight gain I just think people shouldnt eat too much Whenever I hear someone saying Oh I cant lose weight I say Sellotape She mimes taping her mouth shut I said this just the other day to a big fat man Everything in moderation is my motto Earlier in 2013 Allen was watching the news and saw a woman being given the British Empire Medal I think she means Margaret Chartwood from Horley who was given the honour in

169,Piles of digitized material from blogs tweets pictures and videos to official documents such as court rulings and emails may be lost forever because the programs needed to view them will become defunct Googles vicepresident has warned Humanitys first steps into the digital world could be lost to future historians Vint Cerf told the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences annual meeting in San Jose California warning that we faced a forgotten generation or even a forgotten century through what he called bit rot where old computer files become useless junk Cerf called for the development of digital vellum to preserve old software and hardware so that outofdate files could be recovered no matter how old they are When you think about the quantity of documentation from our daily lives that is captured in digital form like our interactions by email peoples tweets and all of the world wide web its clear that we stand to lose an awful lot of our history he said We dont want our digital lives to fade away If we want to preserve them we need to make sure that the digital objects we create today can still be rendered far into the future he added What is bit rot and is Vint Cerf right to be worried Being able to access digital content in the coming decades could be less of an issue than one of the fathers of the internet has implied The warning highlights an irony at the heart of modern technology where music photos letters and other documents are digitized in the hope of ensuring their longterm survival But while researchers are making progress in storing digital files for centuries the programs and hardware needed to make sense of the files are continually falling out of use We are nonchalantly throwing all of our data into what could become an information black hole without realizing it We digitize things because we think we will preserve them but what we dont understand is that unless we take other steps those digital versions may not be any better and may even be worse than the artefacts that we digitized Cerf says If there are photos you really care about print them out Ancient civilizations suffered no such problems because histories written in cuneiform on baked clay tablets or rolled papyrus scrolls needed only eyes to read them To study todays culture future scholars would be faced with PDFs Word documents and hundreds of other file types that can only be interpreted with dedicated software and sometimes hardware too The problem is already here In the 1980s it was routine to save documents on floppy disks upload Jet Set Willy from cassette to the ZX spectrum slaughter aliens with a Quickfire II joystick and have Atari games cartridges in the attic Even if the disks and cassettes are in good condition the equipment needed to run them is now mostly found only in museums The rise of gaming has its own place in the story of digital culture but Cerf warns that important political and historical documents will also be lost to bit rot In 2005 American historian Doris Kearns Goodwin wrote Team of Rivals the Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln describing how Lincoln hired those who ran against him for presidency She went to libraries around the US found the physical letters of the people involved and reconstructed their conversations In todays world those letters would be emails and the chances of finding them will be vanishingly small one hundred years from now said Cerf He concedes that historians will take steps to preserve material considered important by todays standards but argues that the significance of documents and correspondence is often not fully appreciated until hundreds of years later Historians have learned how the greatest mathematician of antiquity considered the concept of infinity and anticipated calculus in 3BC after the Archimedes palimpsest was found hidden under the words of a Byzantine prayer book from the thirteenth century Weve been surprised by what weve learned from objects that have been preserved purely by chance that give us insights into an earlier civilization he said Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh have made headway towards a solution to bit rot or at least a partial one There Mahadev Satyanarayanan takes digital snapshots of computer hard drives while they run different software programs These can then be uploaded to a computer that mimics the one the software ran on The result is a computer that can read otherwise defunct files Under a project called Olive the researchers have archived Mystery House the original 1982 graphic adventure game for the Apple II an early version of WordPerfect and Doom the original 1993 first person shooter game Inventing new technology is only half the battle though More difficult still could be navigating the legal permissions to copy and store software before it dies When IT companies go out of business or stop supporting their products they may sell the rights on making it a nightmarish task to get approval To do this properly the rights of preservation might need to be incorporated into our thinking about things like copyright and patents and licensing Were talking about preserving them for hundreds to thousands of years said Cerf,The vicepresident of Google has warned that piles of digitized material blogs tweets pictures videos and

old When you think about the quantity of documentation from our daily lives that is captured in digital form like our interactions by email peoples tweets and all of the world wide web its clear that we could lose an awful lot of our history he said We dont want our digital lives to fade away If we want to preserve them we need to make sure that the digital objects we create today can still be viewed far into the future he added What is bit rot and is Vint Cerf right to be worried Accessing digital content in the future could be less of a problem than Cerf thinks His warning highlights an irony at the heart of modern technology where music photos letters and other documents are digitized in order to ensure their longterm survival But while researchers are making progress in storing digital files for centuries the programs and hardware needed to read the files are continually falling out of use We are throwing all of our data into what could become an information black hole without realizing it We digitize things because we think we will preserve them But what we dont understand is that unless we take other steps those digital versions may not be any better and may even be worse than the artefacts that we digitized Cerf says If there are photos you really care about print them out Ancient civilizations did not have these problems because histories written on clay tablets or sheets of papyrus needed only eyes to read them To study todays culture future scholars would be faced with PDFs Word documents and hundreds of other file types that can only be interpreted with special software and sometimes hardware too The problem is already here In the 1980s it was routine to save documents on floppy disks and buy computer games on cassettes Even if the disks and cassettes are in good condition the equipment needed to run them is now mostly found only in museums Cerf warns that important political and historical documents will also be lost to bit rot In 2005 American historian Doris Kearns Goodwin wrote Team of Rivals the Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln She went to libraries around the US found the physical letters of the people involved and reconstructed their conversations In todays world those letters would be emails and the chances of finding them will be incredibly small one hundred years from now said Cerf He concedes that historians will take steps to preserve material considered important by todays standards But he argues that the significance of documents and correspondence is often not fully appreciated until hundreds of years later Historians have learned how Archimedes the greatest mathematician of antiquity considered the concept of infinity and anticipated calculus in 3BC after his writings were found hidden under the words of a thirteenthcentury prayer book Weve been surprised by what weve learned about an earlier civilizations from objects that have been preserved only by chance he said Researchers in Pittsburgh have made progress towards finding a solution to bit rot Digital snapshots of computer hard drives are taken while they run different software programs These can then be uploaded to a computer that copies the one the software ran on The result is a computer that can read defunct files Inventing new technology is only half the battle though It could be even more difficult to obtain the legal permissions to copy and store software before it dies When IT companies go out of business they may sell the rights to someone else which makes it very difficult to get approval To do this properly the rights of preservation might need to be incorporated into our thinking about things like copyright and patents and licensing Were talking about preserving them for hundreds to thousands of years said Cerf,train,ADV,INT

according to an analysis of spending and investment by jackpot winners Since its launch in 1994 the lottery has created 3000 millionaires who have won more than 85bn in total at an average of 28m each The trickledown effect means that between them they have created a further 3780 millionaires among their children family and friends according to the authors of the study Oxford Economics Most winners 59 give up work straight away but 19 carry on doing the day job and 31 do unpaid voluntary work The good news for the economy is that 98 of winners spending remained in the UK Through their spending on property vehicles and holidays it is estimated that each winner keeps six people in a fulltime job for a year Winners have contributed almost 750m to gross domestic product GDP and generated more than 500m in tax receipts for the Exchequer The bulk of the money went on property with 272bn spent on winners main properties and 170m in paying off existing debt and mortgages Maintaining income was a priority with 2125bn spent on investments Gifts to family and friends accounted for 117bn and 680m was spent on cars and holidays The study commissioned by Camelot the operators of the UK National Lottery to mark the 3000winners milestone was based on research from 100 1mplus winners It found that in total the 3000 winners have purchased 7958 houses or flats in the UK or 27 each spending 33bn

152,He is the star of one of the worlds longest running and most successful film series with 23 movies and more than 6bn amassed at the global box office but James Bond shows no signs of slowing down In fact the Bond brand is stronger than ever after the recordbreaking performance of Skyfall which became the biggest ever film at the UK box office on its release in 2012 and with its total earnings of 11bn currently stands in ninth place of alltime largest earners Hence the intense interest that surrounded the announcement of a few more details of the 24th Bond film not the least its official title Spectre The number one question is this can Spectre repeat the Skyfall trick Will Skyfall remain a high water mark for the Bond movie or can Spectre extend this winning run Charles Gant film editor for Heat magazine says the indications are it is heading in the right direction Skyfall was a brilliant strategic move he says It was cleverly positioned as simultaneously modern and retro It appealed to the DanielCraigera fans who are relative newcomers to the franchise and it also managed to engage the older more nostalgic elements of the audience who may have lost interest over the previous few films With the new title he adds they are already on to a winner My feeling is that Spectre announces that they want to hang on to the nostalgic more agediverse Bond fan as well as retaining the younger audience The initial signs are that Eon Productions the company originally founded in 1961 to make Dr No and that is behind all the official Bonds is doing its utmost to ensure lightning strikes twice by installing the key creative talent behind Skyfall on Spectre Daniel Craig has been tied down at least until Bond 25 while the same writers have produced the script But its the recapture of director Sam Mendes that gives Bondwatchers the most hope A director principally known for character studies such as American Beauty and Revolutionary Road Mendes has taken the Bond series to new heights Gant says Mendes managed to engage with both the modern and the traditional Bond audience and he also pulled in highcalibre actors like Ralph Fiennes To get actors like Fiennes in they have to be happy with the director Among other achievements Skyfall virtually doubled the box office of its predecessor Quantum of Solace which managed a worldwide figure of 586m on its release in 2008 No one is expecting anything like that this time but Eon will not be complacent Though the Bond series was not in trouble before Mendess arrival and Craigs there was the sense of a certain amount of staleness towards the end of Pierce Brosnans run The series had survived the drying up of actual Bond stories to adapt the movies having long since departed from any resemblance to the Ian Fleming originals but it was lacking a certain dynamism This cycle however was nothing new the history of the Bond series has been one of ebb and flow stasis and renewal revolving most obviously around the lead actor first Sean Connery then successively George Lazenby Roger Moore Timothy Dalton Brosnan and now Craig Each appointment has been a response to the state of the series and some have worked out better than others Lazenby only lasted a single film while Daltons two efforts The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill coincided with a period in the late 80s when the 007 movie had been thoroughly eclipsed by more aggressive slickly produced Hollywood action movies According to Gant the period of Roger Moores last ones going into Dalton didnt really excite audiences Brosnan saw a bit of an upturn commercially while Craig has taken it to new levels On the other hand the early Bonds were incredibly commercial films sexy and exciting and there was very little around like them Its a point worth underlining that although Skyfalls actual receipts dwarf all the other Bond films the performance of some of the 1960s entries in the series was almost as brilliant by comparison With figures adjusted for inflation the 1965 release Thunderball is only a hairs breadth below Skyfall while Goldfinger and You Only Live Twice both outperformed the other Craig films as did the 70s Bonds The Spy Who Loved Me and Live and Let Die By this reckoning Licence to Kill is the worstperforming of all Bonds with Moores final effort A View to a Kill in secondtolast place Nevertheless the Bond brand has remained immensely powerful over the decades with Eon being forced to fend off attempts by rival outfits to capitalize on the seriess popularity Through a quirk of rights ownership adaptations of Casino Royale in 1967 and Thunderball as Never Say Never Again in 1983 were released in competition with Eon productions Although subject to legal disputes over several decades Eon now has full control of both books Casino Royale whose rights had been individually sold off by Fleming in 1955 eventually passed to Eon in 1999 as a result of an agreement between Eons backers MGM and rival Hollywood studio Sony thereby clearing the way for the 2006 version Thunderball on the other hand owed its disputed status to writerproducer Kevin McClory who helped Fleming outline the original story and who claimed ownership of the novel over subsequent decades and produced Never Say Never Again as a result After McClorys death in 2006 his family eventually settled with MGM and Eons parent company in November 2013 If the initial surge of enthusiasm for Bond movies lasted through the 60s and into the 1970s its fair to say that the series almost ground to a halt after Licence to Kills poor figures Goldeneye the first of Brosnans efforts heralded a dramatic renewal not simply because of a new actor but more significantly because of who was behind the camera However after a sixyear break Eon installed Martin Campbell in the chair another experienced British director but one who was able to orchestrate one of the most elaborate stunts in Bond history The justly renowned opening scene of Goldeneye during which Bond freefalls into the cockpit of a pilotless light aeroplane did much to reinvigorate and modernize the series on its own Moreover a whole new generation was reached through a hugely successful Goldeneye videogame spinoff making a significant contribution to perceptions that the Bond film was no longer stale and oldfashioned,James Bond films are one of the worlds longest running and most successful film series with 23 movies and more than 6bn earned at box offices around the world But James Bond shows no signs of slowing down In fact Bond is more popular than ever after the recordbreaking performance of Skyfall which became the biggest ever film at the UK box office in 2012 earning a total of 11bn For this reason there was a lot of interest surrounding the announcement of a few more details about the 24th Bond film especially its official title Spectre The number one question is can Spectre repeat Skyfalls success Charles Gant

also engaged the older more nostalgic Bond fans who may have lost interest over the previous few films With the new title he adds it is certain to be a success It seems that Eon Productions the

mainly known for character studies such as American Beauty and Revolutionary Road Mendes has taken the Bond series to new heights Gant says Mendes managed to engage with both the modern and the

124,The Virunga National Park home to rare mountain gorillas but targeted for oil exploration by a British company could earn troubletorn DR Congo 400m a year from tourism hydropower and carbon credits said a WWF report But if the UNESCO World Heritage Site that straddles the equator is exploited for oil as the Congolese government and exploration firm SOCO International are hoping it could lead to devastating pollution and permanent conflict in an already unstable region says the conservation body SOCO International is the only company seeking to explore inside the boundaries of the Virunga park SOCO insist that their operations in Congo would be confined to an area in the park known as Block V and would not affect the gorillas SOCO Chairman Rui de Sousa said Despite the views of WWF SOCO is extremely sensitive to the environmental significance of the Virunga National Park It is irrefutable that oil companies still have a central role in todays global energy supply and a successful oil project has the potential to transform the economic and social wellbeing of a whole country He added The park has sadly been in decline for many years officially falling below the standards required for a World Heritage Site The potential for development just might be the catalyst that reverses this trend However Raymond Lumbuenamo country director for WWF Democratic Republic of the Congo based in Kinshassa said that security in and around the park would deteriorate further if SOCO went ahead with its exploration plans The security situation is already bad The UN is involved with fighting units and the M23 rebel force is inside the park Oil would be a curse It always increases conflict It would attract human sabotage The park might become like the Niger Delta Developing Virunga for oil will not make anything better The population there is already very dense with over 350 people per square kilometre When you take part of the land for oil you put more pressure on the rest Oil would not provide many jobs people would flood in looking for work he said One fear is that the area is seismically active and another eruption of one of the volcanoes in the park could damage oil company infrastructure and lead to oil spills in the lakes Virungas rich natural resources are for the benefit of the Congolese people not for foreign oil prospectors to drain away Our countrys future depends on sustainable economic development said Lumbuenamo For me choosing the conservation option is the best option Once you have started drilling for oil theres no turning back he said But Lumbuenamo accepted that while the gorillas were safe at present the chances of the park generating its potential of 400m a year were remote It would be difficult to make the kind of money that the report talks of Virunga used to be a very peaceful place and can be again The security situation right now is bad The UN is involved with fighting units Its not as quiet as it used to be According to the WWF report ecosystems in the park could support hydropower generation fishing and ecotourism and play an important role in providing secure water supplies regulating climate and preventing soil erosion The park Africas oldest and most diverse is home to over 3000 different kinds of animals but is now heavily populated with desperately poor people many of whom fled there after the Rwanda massacre in 1994 In all the park could support in the region of 45000 permanent jobs In addition people around the world could get an immense value from simply knowing that the park is well managed and is safe for future generations says the report Virunga represents a valuable asset to DR Congo and contributes to Africas heritage as the oldest and most biodiverse park on the continent the report continues Plans to explore for oil and exploit oil reserves put Virungas potential value at risk it says This is where we draw the line Oil companies are standing on the doorstep of one of the worlds most precious and fragile places but we will not rest until Virunga is safe from this potential environmental disaster said Lasse Gustavsson executive director of WWF International Virunga has snow fields and lava fields but it should not have oil fields The UNESCO World Heritage Committee called for the cancellation of all Virunga oil permits and appealed to concession holders Total SA and SOCO International plc not to undertake exploration in World Heritage Sites Total has committed to respecting Virungas current boundary leaving UKbased SOCO as the only oil company with plans to explore inside the park,The Virunga National Park is home to rare mountain gorillas but is targeted for oil exploration by a British company The park could earn DR Congo 400m a year from tourism

85,Fit in four minutes It sounds like a headline from a health magazine an unattainable promise on latenight satellite TV Then you attempt Dr Izumi Tabatas training protocol 20 seconds of allout effort 10 seconds of rest repeat eight times and between sounding like Darth Vader as you desperately suck in oxygen and collapsing in a messy bundle of sweat and defeat you realize just how wrong you were Tabata has seen it all before They were dead he chuckles as he recalls the first time he inflicted the system that bears his name on his university students in the early 1990s After four minutes hard exercise they were wiped out But after six weeks they saw the results and were surprised We all were His research followed extensive monitoring of Japans speed skating team in the early 1990s when he along with the teams coach Irisawa Koichi noticed that short bursts of brutally hard exercise seemed to be at least as effective as hours of moderate training Tabata set out to show this with a simple experiment One group of moderately trained students performed an hour of steady cardiovascular exercise on a stationary bike five times a week The other group did a tenminute warmup on the bike followed by four minutes of Tabata intervals four times a week plus one 30minute session of steady exercise with two minutes of intervals The results were startling After six weeks of testing the group following Tabatas plan exercising for just 88 minutes a week had increased their anaerobic capacity by 28 and their VO2 max a key indicator of cardiovascular health and maximal aerobic power by 15 The control group who trained for five hours every week also improved their VO2 max but by 10 and their training had no effect on anaerobic capacity We have also measured increases in heart size after three weeks of doing the protocol says Tabata And there is also forthcoming research that shows that it lowers the risk of diabetes in humans something we have already shown in rats But there are no halfmeasures here You cant go steady on a cross trainer chewing gum and reading the latest issue of HELLO The regimen demands headdown bursts on a stationary bike or rowing machine explosive bodyweight exercises sprints or suchlike Remember how you felt after doing a 100m sprint at school Imagine doing eight of them with only a tensecond break to recover Allout effort at 170 of your VO2 max is the criterion of the protocol says Tabata If you feel OK afterwards youve not done it properly The first three repetitions will feel easy but the last two will feel impossibly hard In the original plan the aim was to get to eight but some only lasted six or seven As one commenter on the popular exercise forum TNation puts it When done correctly you should meet God Most people are incapable of doing it correctly and shouldnt even try Tabata doesnt completely agree Everyone can do it but beginners should start with educated trainers so that they can work at the correct intensity for them he explains He says that he will soon publish research showing that doing the programme just twice a week less than half the volume in the original research still provides significant health benefits Another soontobepublished finding which Tabata describes as rather significant shows that the Tabata protocol burns an extra 150 calories in the 12 hours after exercise even at rest due to the effect of excess postexercise oxygen consumption So while it is used by most people to get fit or by fit people to get even fitter it also burns fat Its slightly surprising therefore that the plan is still the preserve of the serious athlete and musclehead crowd although that may change now that Tabata has agreed a deal with Universal Studios that will lead to a network of instructors and a DVD range released towards the end of the year I decided to do this because I often go on YouTube and while I am honoured that people are doing it some are doing it wrong because they dont realize the intensity you need to work at says Tabata So should we all start incorporating this plan into our fitness regimens Richard Scrivener a former Assistant Strength and Conditioning Coach at Northampton Saints Rugby Club says that while the benefits are clear Tabatas are an addition not a replacement to a favoured sport or training method Runners for instance need a high level of running economy which comes from skill acquisition and putting in the miles says Scrivener But they could effectively ease off the long runs and reduce the overall mileage by introducing Tabata training This will unload the skeleton and give joints the chance to rest and recover especially if one is prone to niggles or has a history of injuries and you would probably therefore get more out of the long runs when you do undertake them Gym rats can benefit by doing three strength sessions and three Tabatas a week And the rest of us can build up session by session week by week all the time knowing that it will never get easier because every session calls for maximum effort Thats the cruel genius of the protocol it is unrelenting and effective,Fit in four minutes sounds like a headline from a health magazine or an impossible promise on latenight satellite TV Then you try Dr Izumi Tabatas training programme 20 seconds of allout effort ten seconds of rest repeat eight times and after collapsing on the floor you realize you were wrong Tabata has seen it all before They were dead he laughs as he remembers the first time he tried out his system on his university students in the early 1990s After four minutes hard exercise they were completely exhausted But after six weeks they saw the results and were surprised We all were He began his research after he watched Japans speed skating team in the early 1990s he noticed that short bursts of incredibly hard exercise seemed to be at least as effective as hours of moderate training Tabata tried to prove this with a simple experiment One group of moderately trained students did an hour of steady cardiovascular exercise on an exercise bike five times a week The other group did a tenminute warmup on the bike followed by four minutes of Tabata training four times a week plus one 30minute session of steady exercise with two minutes of Tabata The results were very surprising After six weeks of testing the group following Tabatas plan exercising for just 88 minutes a week had increased their anaerobic capacity by 28 and their VO2 max something that shows your cardiovascular health and maximal aerobic power by 15 The control group who trained for five hours every week also improved their VO2 max but by 10 and their training had no effect on anaerobic capacityWe also measured increases in heart size after three weeks of doing the exercises says Tabata But you have to work very very hard You cant sit on a cross trainer chewing gum and reading the latest issue of HELLO The programme demands intensive bursts on a stationary bike or rowing machine explosive bodyweight exercises sprints and so on Remember how you felt after doing a 100m sprint at school Imagine doing eight of them with only a tensecond break to recover Allout effort at 170 of your VO2 max is the basis of the programme says Tabata If you feel OK afterwards youve not done it properly The first three repetitions will feel easy but the last two will feel impossibly hard In the original plan the aim was to get to eight but some only managed six or seven One person on an online forum wrote When done correctly you should meet God Most people are

170,Swedish prisons have long had a reputation around the world for being progressive But are the countrys prisons a soft option The head of Swedens prison and probation service Nils Oberg announced in November 2013 that four Swedish prisons are to be closed due to an out of the ordinary decline in prisoner numbers Although there has been no fall in crime rates between 2011 and 2012 there was a 6 drop in Swedens prisoner population now a little over 4500 A similar decrease is expected in 2013 and 2014 Oberg admitted to being puzzled by the unexpected dip but expressed optimism that the reason was to do with how his prisons are run We certainly hope that the efforts we invest in rehabilitation and preventing relapse of crime has had an impact he said The modern prison service in Sweden is very different from when I joined as a young prison officer in 1978 says Kenneth Gustafsson governor of Kumla Prison Swedens most secure jail situated 130 miles west of Stockholm However he doesnt think the system has gone soft When I joined the focus was very much on humanity in prisons Prisoners were treated well maybe too well some might say But after a number of highprofile escapes in 2004 we had to rebalance and place more emphasis on security Despite the hardening of attitudes toward prison security following the escape scandals the Swedes still managed to maintain a broadly humane approach to sentencing even of the most serious offenders jail terms rarely exceed ten years those who receive life imprisonment can still apply to the courts after a decade to have the sentence commuted to a fixed term usually in the region of 18 to 25 years Sweden was the first country in Europe to introduce the electronic tagging of convicted criminals and continues to strive to minimize shortterm prison sentences wherever possible by using communitybased measures which have been proven to be more effective at reducing reoffending The overall reoffending rate in Sweden stands at between 30 and 40 over three years to compare that with another European country the number is around half that of the UK One likely reason for the relatively low reoffending rate and the low rate of incarceration in Sweden below 70 per 100000 head of population is that the age of criminal responsibility is set at 15 In the UK for example children aged ten to 17 and young people under the age of 21 record the highest reoffending rates almost three quarters and two thirds respectively A good proportion of these offenders go on to populate adult jails In Sweden no young person under the age of 21 can be sentenced to life this is not the case in many other countries and every effort is made to ensure that as few juvenile offenders as possible end up in prison One strong reason for the drop in prison numbers might be the amount of postprison support available in Sweden A confident probation service a government agency is tasked not only with supervising those on probation but is also guaranteed to provide treatment programmes for offenders with drug alcohol or violence issues The service is assisted by around 4500 lay supervisors members of the public who volunteer to befriend and support offenders under supervision Gustafsson talks about broader goals and objectives for the Swedish justice department In 2013 and 2014 the priority of our work will be with young offenders and men with convictions of violent behaviour For many years we have been running programmes to help those addicted to drugs Now we are also developing programmes to address behaviours such as aggression and violence These are the important things for our society when these people are released I spoke to a former prisoner who now runs a social enterprise called XCons Sweden Peter Soderlund served almost three years of a fouryear sentence for drug and weapons offences before he was released in 1998 He was helped by a newly formed organization run by former prisoners called Kris Criminals Return Into Society The big difference between Kris and us is that we are happy to allow people who are still taking addiction medications to join us he says Both organizations work with the same goal helping prisoners successfully reintegrate into society after they have been released And what is life like for the prisoner in Sweden When I was inside I was lucky In Osteraker Prison where I served my sentence the governor was enlightened We were treated well But I knew that not all Swedish prisons were like that I met so many people in there who needed help after I received help from Kris I knew I wanted to help others With XCons we meet them at the gate and support them into accommodation and offer a network of support In Sweden we believe very much in the concept of rehabilitation without being naive of course says Gustafsson There are some people who will not or cannot change But in my experience the majority of prisoners want to change and we must do what we can to help to facilitate that It is not always possible to achieve this in one prison sentence Also it is not just prison that can rehabilitate it is often a combined process involving probation and greater society We can give education and training but when they leave prison these people need housing and jobs,Swedish prisons have long had a reputation around the world for being progressive But are the countrys prisons a soft option The head of Swedens prison and probation service Nils Oberg said in November 2013 that four Swedish prisons will close due to an out of the ordinary fall in prisoner numbers Although there has been no fall in crime rates between 2011 and 2012 there was a 6 fall in Swedens prisoner population now a little over 4500 A similar decrease is expected in 2013 and 2014 Oberg said he was puzzled by the unexpected fall but hoped that the reason was to do with how his prisons are run We certainly hope that the efforts we put into rehabilitation and preventing criminals from

number is around half that of the UK One thing that has kept reoffending down and the number of prisoners in Sweden below 70 per 100000 people is that the age of criminal responsibility is 15 In the UK for example children aged ten to 17 and young people under the age of 21 have the highest reoffending rates In Sweden no young person under the age of 21 can be sentenced to life this is not the

7,The regulation eight hours in the office is over The most important work of the day is done whatever is left can wait until the morning This is the point many workers would think about heading for the door Yet for millions of Japanese employees the thought of clearing away their desks and being at home in time for dinner is enough to invite accusations of disloyalty But after decades of giving companies carte blanche to milk every last drop of productivity from their workforce a challenge to Japans ingrained culture of overwork has come from the government which is considering making it a legal requirement for workers to take at least five days paid holiday a year Japanese employees are currently entitled to an average 185 days paid holiday a year only two fewer than the global average with a minimum of ten days as well as 15 oneday national holidays In reality few come even close to taking their full quota typically using only nine of their 185day average entitlement according to the labour ministry While many British workers regard a twoweek summer holiday as an inalienable right workers in Japan have come to see a fournight vacation in Hawaii as the height of selfindulgence The move to be debated in the current parliamentary session comes after companies started encouraging employees to nap on the job to improve their performance By the end of the decade the government hopes that if passed the law will push Japanese employees towards following the example set by British workers who use an average of 20 days paid annual leave and those in France who take an average of 25 Japans unforgiving work culture may have helped turn it into an economic superpower its corporate foot soldiers revered in the rest of the world for their commitment to the company but this has often been to the exclusion of everything else Japans low birth rate and predictions of rapid population decline are partly blamed on the lack of time couples have to start families More employees are falling ill from stress or worse succumbing to karoshi death through overwork Despite studies suggesting that longer hours in the office or workshop or on the factory floor do not necessarily make people more productive todays workers are still nursing a collective hangover from the bubble years of the 1980s About 22 of Japanese work more than 49 hours a week compared with 16 of US workers and 11 in France and Germany according to data compiled by the Japanese government At 35 South Koreas workaholics are even worse off In spending 14 hours a day at work and giving up many of her paid holidays Erika Sekiguchi is not even an extreme example The 36yearold trading company employee used eight of her 20 days of paid vacation in 2014 six of which counted as sick leave Nobody else uses their vacation days Sekiguchi said She faces the dilemma shared by her peers in companies across Japan never to take time off to recharge or to risk inviting criticism for appearing to leave more committed colleagues in the lurch Yuu Wakebe a health ministry official overseeing policy on working hours who admits putting in 100 hours of overtime a month blames the irresistible pressure to match ones colleagues hour for hour It is a workers right to take paid vacations Wakebe said But working in Japan involves quite a lot of volunteer spirit That fear of being ostracized at work is being blamed for a rise in stressrelated illness premature death and suicide According to official data about 200 people die every year from heart attacks strokes and other karoshi events brought on by punishing work schedules The prime minister Shinzo Abe is not known for taking long vacations Yet even he has spoken out against the unreasonable demands companies place on their employees as they struggle to stay afloat in a more complex globalized market Japans working culture Abe said recently falsely beatifies long hours,Youve spent eight hours in the office The most important work of the

122,Tigers are more numerous in Nepal than at any time since the 1970s a new census has revealed giving conservationists hope that the big cats whose numbers have been dropping across south Asia for 100 years can be saved The number of wild royal bengal tigers in Nepal has increased to 198 a 636 rise in five years the government survey showed This is very encouraging said Maheshwar Dhakal an ecologist with Nepals Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation The census is based on the examination of pictures from more than 500 cameras placed in five protected areas and three wildlife corridors More than 250 conservationists and wildlife experts worked on the survey which cost about 250000 Dhakal said that a parallel survey was conducted in India and the results from both countries will be published later in 2013 It will take a few more months for India which now has 1300 big cats in several huge protected areas to finalize the data he added Nepal has pledged to double the population of tigers by the year 2022 from 121 in 2009 when the last systematic tiger count took place Increasing prosperity in Asia has pushed up prices for tiger skins and the body parts used in traditional Chinese medicines International gangs pay poor local Nepali significant sums to kill the cats The skin and bones are handed to middlemen who pass easily through the porous border to India where the major dealers are based One major problem is complicity between senior officials and mafia networks involved in the trade Conservation experts credit the increase in numbers to the effective policing of national parks stronger antipoaching drives and better management of tiger habitats in Nepal where forests cover 29 of the land But they say Nepal needs to do more to protect the habitat and animals on which tigers prey so the big cats have enough space to roam and food to eat As the number of tigers has increased over the years so have incidents of conflict with villagers Seven people were killed in attacks by tigers around national parks in 2012 compared to four in 2011 park officials said Villagers are also seeking better protection The government is making conservation plans for tigers But it should also come up with plans to protect people from tigers Krishna Bhurtel a local village headman in Chitwan told Nepali newspaper Nagarik Wildlife authorities captured a tiger in Chitwan after it killed two people including a villager who was pulled from his bed in May Thousands of tigers once roamed the forests in Bangladesh India and Nepal But their numbers have

Reserve 17 Diwakar Chapagain who heads a World Wildlife Fund Nepal unit that monitors wildlife trade said tiger skins were in demand in Tibet where wellheeled people use them as festival costumes In Nepal kings used to stand on tiger skins in front of stuffed tigers for special occasions Some affluent Nepali have mounted tiger heads on the walls of their living rooms Tiger bones are in high demand for use in traditional Chinese medicines The trade in tiger parts is lucrative and fetches thousands of dollars in illegal markets Chapagain said highlighting the threat tigers face,According to a new census there are more tigers in Nepal than at any time since the 1970s This has given conservationists hope that the big cats whose numbers have been dropping across south Asia for 100 years

hammering and the chemicals in the air that catch in the back of the throat and irritate the eyes make it hard to concentrate The children who learn in this threesquaremetre room are the lucky ones however They have escaped working in the factories opposite For 14 years SOHAY a grassroots nongovernmental organization NGO funded by the Global Fund for Children and Comic Relief has been working in slum areas of Dhaka to get child labourers into school It focuses on children working in hazardous conditions in aluminium and plastic factories and tanneries The classroom is one of 23 urban development centres that SOHAY has set up across the capital The centres prepare children for primary school with classes that help them catch up on their education Once they are in primary school the children can do homework at the centres with help from their peers Alamin ten who used to work in a plastic factory attends one of the centres His father is a street seller and his mother a parttime domestic worker They are all happy that hes now in school and away from hazardous work His friend Rabi says he wants to forget his past in the factory I like school he says The urban development centres aim to create an educationfriendly environment in the communities and change their cultural mindset towards the children says SOHAYs programme manager Mohammed Abdullah alMamun SOHAY also runs sessions for parents and employers to discourage child labour and offers skills training to increase family income Getting working children into formal education is really very challenging says Mamun Their psychological and physical condition is not like other children in society After they leave work they sometimes find it difficult to make friends and adapt to school It is also very challenging to ensure they stay in school the dropout rate is very high for these children In this context its important to work with schools so they have more sensitivity and care about them Sevenyearold Zhorna Akter Sumayya has two older brothers both of whom are in work one at a restaurant one at a local club But after being introduced to education at one of SOHAYs centres she now goes to a state primary school Her family live in the slum and her parents cant survive without the income their sons bring home Her father works in a rickshaw garage and her mother is a domestic worker but they were keen for their daughter to go to school In 2015 SOHAY helped 1540 children to leave hazardous work and 2125 vulnerable children those in danger of entering work into school About 780 more children are preparing to enter school in 2017 The organization is also helping 635 children who are working in hazardous conditions to know their rights under Bangladeshs 2010 child labour elimination code of conduct The policy aimed to eradicate all forms of child labour by 2015 but that target was missed The Labour Law of Bangladesh 2006 bans children under the age of 14 from working but according to the UN childrens agency UNICEF 47 million children under that age are employed in the informal sector and 13 million aged five to 17 work in hazardous industries It was difficult to get them into school without any compensation for their time says Sadia Nasrin who runs Sonjag another Dhaka grassroots NGO To overcome this challenge Sonjag started working closely with the community in the slums where the children live The organization talked to community members about why it was important to get children into school They selected community volunteers who were motivated to change childrens lives and formed groups with social workers community leaders mothers young volunteers and the local government The groups play a vital role in motivating employers to let children leave for two to three hours a day to attend school and to ensure a safe workplace for the children The ultimate changemakers are the community people says Nasrin She adds that people living in slums face threats of eviction police raids and displacement The national plan of action for children does not recognize the needs of street children says Nasrin Legislative measures are limited When the children have missed starting school at five years old it is a race against time to prevent them from growing up without an education After they cross their school age it is really very difficult to admit them into school says Mamun Children are just passing their time without education and waiting to become involved in hazardous work We are working to block the child labour flow,The small space is set up to

40,When the Taliban sent a gunman to shoot Malala Yousafzai in October 2012 as she rode home on a bus after school they made clear their intention to silence the teenager and kill off her campaign for girls education Nine months and countless surgical operations later she stood up at the United Nations on her 16th birthday on Friday to deliver a defiant riposte They thought that the bullet would silence us But they failed she said As 16th birthdays go it was among the more unusual Instead of blowing out candles on a cake Malala sat in one of the main council chambers at the United Nations in the central seat usually reserved for world leaders She listened quietly as Ban Kimoon the UN secretarygeneral described her as our hero our champion and as the former British prime minister and now UN education envoy Gordon Brown uttered what he called the words the Taliban never wanted her to hear happy 16th birthday Malala The event dubbed Malala Day was the culmination of an extraordinary four years for the girl from Mingora in the troubled Swat valley of Pakistan She was thrust into the public glare after she wrote a blog for the BBC Urdu service describing her experiences struggling to get an education under the rising power of Taliban militants By 11 she was showing exceptional determination calling personally on the US special representative to Pakistan Richard Holbrooke to use his influence to combat the Talibans drive against education for girls By 14 she was on the radar of Archbishop Desmond Tutu who put her forward for the International Childrens Peace Prize and by 15 she became the youngest Nobel Peace Prize nominee in history But such dizzying global attention came at a price Death threats followed her growing recognition and on 9 October 2012 following a meeting of Pakistani Taliban leaders the gunman was dispatched to remove what they called the symbol of infidels and obscenity Multiple operations in Pakistan and the UK followed the attack on the bus including the fitting of a titanium plate on her left forehead and a cochlear implant to restore her hearing She now lives with her family in Birmingham and does what the Taliban tried to stop her doing goes to school every day I am not against anyone she said in the UN chamber having taken this day out from the classroom Neither am I here to speak in terms of personal revenge against the Taliban or any other terrorist group Malala responded to the violence of the Taliban with her own countervailing force words against bullets I do not even hate the Talib who shot me Even if there is a gun in my hand and he stands in front of me I would not shoot him She spoke confidently with only an injured eye and a slightly drooping left side of her face to hint at such fresh traumas There was one other unstated allusion to the horror of her past she wore a white shawl belonging to a woman who was also targeted by extremists but who unlike Malala did not survive to tell the tale Benazir Bhutto the former prime minister of Pakistan The extremists are afraid of books and pens the teenager continued The power of education frightens them They are afraid of women The power of the voice of women frightens them She cited the attack in June on a hospital in Quetta capital of Baluchistan and killings of female teachers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa That is why they are blasting schools every day because they were and they are afraid of change afraid of the equality that we will bring to our society And she gave her own opposing interpretation of Islam to the Talibans They think that God is a tiny little conservative being who would send girls to hell just because of going to school The terrorists are misusing the name of Islam and Pashtun society for their own personal benefits Islam is a religion of peace humanity and brotherhood Islam says that it is not only each childs right to get education rather it is their duty and responsibility Such ability to articulate what normally remains unarticulated to give voice to young people normally silenced has generated its own response The Stand with Malala petition calling for education for the 57 million children around the world who do not go to school has attracted more than four million signatures more than a million having been added shortly after Malalas speech At the start of her speech Malala said I dont know where to begin my speech I dont know what people would be expecting me to say She need not have worried,When the Taliban sent a gunman to shoot Malala Yousafzai in October 2012 as she rode home on a bus after school

100,It is not just the worlds biggest burger chain it is also a global emblem of American consumer capitalism But these days the golden arches of McDonalds are looking a little tarnished After a decade of expansion customers around the world dont seem to be lovin it any more McDonalds has revealed that worldwide sales dropped by 33 on 2013 in a set of results that were described as atrocious Problems are piling up almost everywhere In China sales plunged by 23 after a food scare when local media showed workers apparently caught on camera at a local supplier claiming to use outofdate beef and chicken in products destined for McDonalds and KFC In Europe sales are down by 4 mostly because of unrest in Ukraine and the sour antiwestern mood in Russia Around 200 of McDonalds 450 restaurants in Russia are being investigated by health inspectors in apparently politically motivated foodsafety checks Ten have been closed But it is in the US where McDonalds has around 40 of its restaurants where the crisis runs deepest Almost 60 years after Ray Kroc opened his rst restaurant in Des Plaines Illinois consumers are losing their appetite for a Big Mac and fries McDonalds has seen 12 straight months of declining sales in its massive home market with sales down 41 in the latest quarter Younger diners are deserting the restaurant in droves to eat out at rivals such as Chipotle Mexican Grill The number of 19to21yearolds visiting McDonalds once a month has fallen by 13 since 2011 according to food analysts Technomic while the number of 22to37year olds visiting has not grown

Smashburger or Fuddruckers Fastgrowing USonly chain Chick lA was considered to be best for chicken McDonalds is also widely perceived as less healthy than most of its rivals especially Chipotle which trumpets its antibioticfree meat and locally sourced seasonal produce although local for Chipotle can mean 350 miles away The depth of consumer mistrust of McDonalds was exposed by a consumer outreach exercise the company launched in the US in October Have you ever used pink slime in your burgers was one question on the Our Food Your Questions website referring to the controversial beef ller gristle and fat used for dog food that is sprayed with ammonia to make it t for human consumption The meat product banned in Europe since the BSE crisis was dropped by McDonalds in 2012 But pink slime has left doubts in US consumers minds Does McDonalds beef contain worms asked another person No Gross End of story replied the company Others wanted to know whether it uses real eggs or whether the McRib is made with the same plastic contained in yoga mats McDonalds Chief Executive Don Thompson acknowledged the company had a job to do in addressing misconceptions about the freshness quality and integrity of its ingredients Yet just as McDonalds has been losing the customers who will pay a bit more for food perceived as fresher and healthier it has also lost its edge in fastfood essentials speedy service at low prices Ever since it introduced 2 items on its dollar menu it has gained a reputation for being more expensive than its rivals while many consumers complain that service is slower The expensive tag was unjusti ed said Mary Chapman at Technomic Prices have indeed gone up but they havent gone up as quickly as the rest of the fastservice chains in the US Prices at McDonalds have increased by 48 since 2009 well below the quick service sector average up 194 while the cost of fast casual eating a category that includes the muchhyped Chipotle is up 169 according to Technomics menu monitor US consumer prices rose 11 over the same period But critics have a point when it comes to longer queues McDonalds has a bigger menu than some with more complicated items its chicken McWrap takes 60 seconds to make I think it is worth waiting but the guy behind me who wants his double cheeseburger for a dollar might not said Chapman In the UK McDonalds has turned around

33,Sleep deprivation used to be a badge of honour a sign you were busy and important and very much in demand Snoozing was losing and sleep was for wimps Now however Arianna Huffingtons The Sleep Revolution a call to bed that promises to transform your life one night at a time is a New York Times bestseller and Huffington is urging people to sleep their way to the top Meanwhile the sleep industry has woken up big time and a whole range of startups are reinventing where when and how we sleep as well as how much were prepared to pay for it For the more upmarket snoozer luxury hotels are offering sleep retreats more than 1000 gets you dinner and a movie about sleep And if youre staying home you can upgrade your bedroom with everything from a mattress cover with a sensor that tracks your sleep 249 to a brainwavemonitoring sleeping mask that lets you nap more efficiently 299 Sleep hasnt just been corporatized it has infiltrated corporations A number of companies already have nap pods and Huffington predicts that nap rooms in offices are going to become as common as conference rooms in the next two years So how did this happen How did sleep something humans have done since long before Huffington awoke to it suddenly become so fashionable Getting enough sleep is a natural fit for the sort of lifestyle in which paying 10 for green juice and 34 for a SoulCycle class is the norm Then theres the rise of the quantified self through wearable technology Our bodies have become inputoutput devices that we monitor and optimize for greater efficiency and sleep has become another data set to be tracked What Huffington emphasizes about sleep after all is not that it rests you but that it restores you Sleep she says is the ultimate performance enhancer and getting eight hours of rest has become the ultimate status symbol You know how Arianna Huffington gets her eight hours Well for one thing she has nine or so assistants according to a recent New York Times profile Huffington calls them her ATeam they do everything from running her errands to planning her travel to loading The Huffington Post on her computer in the morning According to the Times most of the ATeam can only endure about 12 months of the work because its so taxing The low pay also means many of them take second jobs Basically they dont sleep so that Huffington can and can sell books about it Getting enough sleep isnt just a question of valuing sleep enough to go to bed at the right time its a question of going to bed in the right neighbourhood and in the right body Numerous studies show that youre more likely to sleep poorly if youre poor Its hard to sleep if youre worried about your safety or havent had enough to eat Its hard to sleep if youre one of the 15 million American shift workers who work irregular hours Research has also found that theres a blackwhite sleep gap One study shows that while white people sleep an average of 685 hours African Americans sleep an average of 605 hours They also have a lower quality of sleep Researchers have attributed this in part to the stress of discrimination Want to know who gets the most sleep and the best quality of sleep in America Wealthy white women Which if Id hazard a guess is probably the same demographic Huffington is targeting her book at Huffington describes her promotion of sleep as a revolution but really its a rebranding The very real sleep crisis we face isnt down to a few rich people thinking its a waste of time its down to the 99 not being able to afford to spend time sleeping While sleep is currently enjoying a moment it will probably be shortlived Sleep may be a performance enhancer but its an inefficient one The real prize is finding a way to negate sleep deprivation so humans can function on less sleep Unsurprisingly the military is at the forefront of this research In 2008 the Pentagon published a report called Human Performance which examined the possibility of a future in which soldiers could perform at their peak with only a couple of hours sleep Suppose a human could be engineered who slept for the same amount of time as a giraffe 19 hours per night This would lead to an approximately twofold decrease in the casualty rate An adversary would need an approximately 40 increase in the troop level to compensate for this advantage The report goes on to look at the effects of ampakines a class of drugs that modulate neurotransmitters in the brain to remove the effects of sleep deprivation Eventually humans will figure out a way to get rid of sleep Spending a third of your life unconscious wont be a luxury anymore itll be something only the poor will be forced to do At which point we may need a whole new sort of sleep revolution,Sleep deprivation used to be a sign that you were busy and important and very much in demand Sleep was for wimps Now however Arianna Huffingtons The Sleep Revolution a book that promises to completely change your life one night at a

24,A girl born today in the UK can expect to live nearly to the age of 82 on average while her brother will live to 78 They would have a longer life in Andorra 85 and 79 respectively but are marginally better off than in the US 81 and 76 while if they lived in the Central African Republic they would barely make it out of middle age 49 and 44 Nonetheless almost everywhere in the world with the exception of countries such as Lesotho which have been hit by HIV and violence lifespans are lengthening and the best news is that small children are substantially less likely to die than they were four decades ago There has been a drop in deaths among underfives of nearly 60 from 164 million in 1970 to 68 million in 2010 That in itself is justification for the enormous project that the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation IHME in Seattle has led over the past five years involving nearly 500 researchers to assess the global burden of disease Knowing how many children die and from what cause enables the world to focus its efforts and resources on keeping them alive There are many lessons to be gleaned from the vast database they have put together which will help global organizations and individual governments to better care for us all from a renewed focus on diet to tackling alcohol to keeping up the efforts against HIV in Africa The seven papers published by The Lancet represent a big undertaking and are not without controversy IHME has been ambitiously radical in some of its methods In the absence of death registries or medical records they have been willing for instance to take evidence from verbal autopsies deciding the cause of death by an interview with the family The most startling result has been the malaria figure released earlier in 2012 IHME said 12 million die of the disease every year twice as many as previously thought The big increase is in adult deaths Conventional wisdom has it that malaria kills mostly children under five The way I was taught as a doctor and everybody else is taught is that in malarial areas you become semiimmune as an adult said Dr Christopher Murray IHME Director and one of the founders of the Global Burden of Disease project We originally went with the prevailing opinion but there has been a shift as we have become more empirical African doctors write on hospital records that adults are dying of malaria a lot But he adds their fever could be something else The findings have prompted further studies Although Margaret Chan Director General of the World Health Organization gave the IHME study a warm official welcome some of the staff are cautious We need to be very careful in assessing the validity of the figures said Colin Mathers a senior scientist in the Evidence for Information and Policy Cluster We need to wait to be persuaded by evidence His colleague Dr Tiers Boerma Director of the WHO Department of Health Statistics and Informatics added People should understand that some of the numbers are very different and the WHO cant jump with any academic publication that states a different number However said Mathers the fact that IHME has pushed the envelope with some of these analyses is stimulating One of the main themes said Murray was incredibly rapid change in the leading causes of death and the pace of that change is a lot faster than we expected it to be Reduced fertility and longer life expectancies have meant a rise in the mean age of the worlds population in a decade from 26 years old to almost 30 It has been dramatic in Latin America for instance where countries like Brazil and Paraguay had life expectancy of below 30 in 1970 and almost 64 in 2010 That is a 35year increase in the mean age of death over four decades In a place like Brazil the speed of change is so fast that most institutions are illequipped to deal with it Murray said The second theme entwined with it is the shift outside Africa from communicable diseases and the common causes of mother and baby deaths to what are sometimes termed lifestyle diseases such as heart disease stroke diabetes and cancer some of which have significant genetic triggers That shift has been particularly marked in Latin America the Middle East and southeast and even south Asia he said The third big finding was Murray said a surprise to us That was the sheer extent of disability and the toll it took on people who were living longer but not healthier lives The main causes of disability are different from the ones that kill you he said They were mental health problems such as anxiety and depression musculoskeletal disorders such as arthritis and lower back pain complained of in every country in the world anaemia sight and hearing loss and skin disease In addition there was substance abuse The rates for these are not going down over time he said We are making no progress in reducing these conditions,A girl born today in the UK can expect to live nearly to the age of 82 on average and her brother will live to 78 They would have a longer life in Andorra 85 and 79 respectively but will live a little longer than in the US 81 and 76 If they lived in the Central African Republic they would die in middle age 49 and 44 However almost everywhere in the world with the exception of countries such as Lesotho which have experienced HIV and violence lifespans are lengthening And the best news is that small children are much less likely to die than they were forty years ago There has been a drop in deaths in underfives of nearly 60 from 164 million in 1970 to 68 million in 2010 This last statistic provides justification for the enormous project that the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation IHME in Seattle has led over the past five years involving nearly 500 researchers to assess the global effects of disease Knowing how many children die and from what cause allows the world to focus its efforts and resources on keeping them alive There are many lessons to be learnt from the enormous database they have put together which will help global organizations and individual governments to better care for us all The project was a big task and is not without controversy IHME has been very radical in some of its methods Where they did not have death registries or medical records for instance they have taken evidence from verbal autopsies deciding the cause of death by an interview with the family The most surprising result has been the malaria figure IHME said 12 million die of the disease every year twice as many as previously thought The big increase is in adult deaths It is commonly believed that malaria kills mostly children under five The way I was taught as a doctor and everybody else is taught is that in malarial areas you become semiimmune as an adult said Dr Christopher Murray IHME Director We originally went with that opinion but there has been a change as we have become more empirical following the data African doctors write on hospital records that adults are dying of malaria a lot But he adds their fever could be something else The findings have led to further studies Although Margaret Chan Director General of the World Health Organization gave the IHME study a warm official welcome some of the staff are cautious We need to be very careful in assessing the validity of the figures said Colin Mathers a senior scientist

38,Standing at the edge of space above the deserts of New Mexico Felix Baumgartner paused slightly It was a small step away from the capsule but a 24mile drop back down to Earth Our guardian angel will take care of you said mission control and the man known as Fearless Felix jumped Ten heartstopping minutes later the Austrian landed back on Earth after reaching speeds of up to 725mph and breaking three world records including becoming the worlds first supersonic skydiver by breaking the sound barrier at Mach 124 We love you Felix cheered the control room as his mother Ava Baumgartner wept Baumgartner who claimed the records for the highest altitude manned balloon flight and the highest altitude skydive raised his arms in a victory salute to thank his team He was wearing a specially designed survival suit that kept his body intact against the hugely varying pressures that marked his drop back to Earth Without it his blood would have boiled and his lungs might have exploded Baumgartner later told a press conference When I was standing there on top of the world you become so humble you dont think about breaking records He admitted all he could think about was getting back alive but added Sometimes you have to go up really high to see how small you are After two aborted attempts the week before the mission was given the goahead on Sunday morning with the cooperation of the weather Baumgartner was carried up into crystal clear skies by a gigantic balloon which measured 30 million square cubic feet and whose skin was onetenth the thickness of a sandwich bag At the bottom of the balloon was a capsule in which Baumgartner sat in his suit As he reached the desired height Baumgartner went through a checklist of 40 items with his mentor Joe Kittinger the previous holder of the highest altitude manned balloon flight There was some concern that a heater for his visor was not working causing his visor to fog This is very serious Joe he told Kitttinger Sometimes its getting foggy when I exhale I do not feel heat But they decided to go ahead watched by a record 8 million people as the jump was streamed live on YouTube The twoandahalfhour journey upwards during which the curvature of the Earth became visible and the skies gradually turned black was matched with a rather more rapid descent Three cameras attached to Baumgartners suit recorded his freefall of just over four minutes which failed to break the existing freefall record for duration and then the parachute opening The success of the mission and of the suit raises the prospect that astronauts might be able to survive a high altitude disaster of the type that struck the space shuttle Columbia in 2003 by actually bailing out of their craft Baumgartners top medical man in the stunt was Dr Jonathan Clark whose wife Laurel Clark died in the Columbia accident Clark is now dedicated to improving astronauts chances of survival in a highaltitude disaster Baumgartner has made a name for himself with acts of daring The former paratrooper has parachuted off buildings and mountains and once into a 600 foot deep cave He had already done two practice freefalls in preparation for this attempt one from 71000 feet in March and a second from 97000 feet in July 2012 But no feat can possibly have matched his jump above the town of Roswell a suitably chosen place famed for its connections to UFO sightings He was chasing five different records the first human to ever break the sound barrier in freefall the highest freefall altitude jump the highest manned balloon flight the longest freefall and his jump platform is believed to be the largest manned balloon in history The stunt which was seven years in the planning and sponsored by Red Bull drinks beat two of Kittingers records the retired US air force colonel previously held the high altitude and speed records for parachuting Kittinger jumped from a balloon 19 miles above the planet in 1960 Suitably the only voice in Baumgartners radio earpiece guiding his ascent was that of Kittinger now 84 Asked after the jump what he wanted to do next Baumgartner said I want to inspire a generation Id like to be sitting in the same spot in the next four years as Joe Kittinger There is a young guy asking me for advice because he wants to break my record He said the most exciting moment for him had been when he was standing outside the capsule on top of the world To laughter he added The most beautiful moment was when I was standing on the landing area and Mike Todd the life support engineer who dressed Baumgartner in his suit showed up and he had a smile on his face like a little kid Baumgartner said that he had come to feel like Todds son adding He was so happy that I was alive Earlier Todd had told the press conference The world needs a hero right now and they got one in Felix Baumgartner To further laughter at the press conference Kittinger said I would like to give a special onefingered salute to all the folk who said that he Baumgartner was going to come apart when he went supersonic This will be the last jump Baumgartner said He has promised to settle down and enjoy his postjump years with his girlfriend Nicole Oetl flying helicopters on rescue missions in the US and Austria,Felix Baumgartner stood at the edge of space above New Mexico and paused slightly It was a small step

10,A lonely old man living in a crater on the moon is the unlikely focus of John Lewiss Christmas 2015 advert as the department store puts a charitable spin on its latest multimillion pound campaign Amid increasing hype around John Lewiss seasonal ad which has come to mark the beginning of the Christmas shopping season for many the department store will aim to use its profile to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds for Age UK It will also encourage staff and customers to join up with their local branch of the charity to care for elderly people who might otherwise be alone over the holiday The retailer has spent 7m on a campaign that ranges from the slick TV ad to a smartphone game and merchandise including glowinthedark pyjamas as well as areas decked out like the surface of the moon in 11 stores After two years of successful ads featuring cuddly animals a bear and hare then a penguin this time the retailer is tugging at the heartstrings with a story of a young girl Lily who spots an old man living in a shack on the moon through her telescope The determined child tries sending him a letter and firing a note via bow and arrow before floating him a present of a telescope tied to balloons which finally enables them to make contact The ads strapline is Show someone theyre loved this Christmas which echoes Age UKs own campaign No one should have no one at Christmas Profits from three products a mug gift tag and card will go to the charity The charity really resonates with people at this time of year and the ad lends itself to thinking about someone who lives on your street that might not see anybody said Rachel Swift head of marketing at John Lewis The campaign features the Oasis track Half the World Away reinterpreted by littleknown Norwegian artist Aurora The ad cost 1m to make The moon scenes were shot at the Warner Bros Studios where the Harry Potter films were made and the specially built set was created by one of the team behind the latest Star Wars film The Force Awakens As in the last few years John Lewis has drummed up interest in their most recent ad with a teaser campaign on TV and social media using the hashtag OnTheMoon There will be a full moon on Christmas Day 2015 a complete coincidence according to Swift In 2014 the retailer also spent 7m on a campaign featuring a realistic animated penguin and a young boy playing together to the tune of John Lennons Real Love sung by British singersongwriter Tom Odell It had drummed up 22m views on YouTube by the first week of January ahead of the 166m clocked by Sainsburys ad featuring First World War soldiers sharing a bar of chocolate the UKs next most popular ad of 2014 Swift said that despite the hype John Lewis had stuck to the same strategy for the last five years Its all about thoughtful gifting and going the extra mile for someone you love at Christmas she said We dont go into it thinking This is going to be huge just getting something right for the brand at this time of year and something we hope customers really love Sarah Vizard news editor of trade journal Marketing Week said John Lewis appeared to have reined in its efforts this time with a lowerkey presence in stores despite a growing army of competitors There are definitely a lot more brands doing Christmas ads this year but I think a lot of those brands who tried to compete with John Lewis by doing something emotional and creative have gone back to what you can buy in store she said John Lewis still does the emotional piece the best This campaign is another great way of putting that across in a way that will resonate with customers I think people will think it is really cute Among those fighting for attention in the flurry of Christmas ads was sister chain Waitrose which launched its Christmas ad online on social media ahead of a TV debut during The X Factor It used the agency which has created John Lewiss Christmas ads for years Burberry has launched what is only its second festive film featuring Romeo Beckham and Elton John while electrical chain Currys drafted in Jeff Goldblum for its first ever dedicated Christmas ad Asda Lidl and Morrisons also launched their campaigns at the beginning of November Marc Bolland chief executive of Marks Spencer which also launched its Christmas ad at the beginning of November said that in the first week of September the most searched term on its website was Christmas Boots another retailer launching its festive campaign in early November is going back to a more traditional approach after a critically acclaimed ad in 2014 which featured a

157,The mass collection of telephone records by government surveillance programmes poses a clear threat to the personal privacy of ordinary citizens according to US researchers who used basic phone logs to identify people and uncover confidential information about their lives Armed with anonymous metadata on peoples calls and texts but not the content of the communications two scientists at Stanford University worked out individuals names where they lived and the names of their partners But that was not all The same data led them to uncover potentially sensitive information about some individuals One man was found to own a rifle while another had recently been diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat Other data pointed to a new pregnancy and a person with multiple sclerosis The results highlight the extraordinary power of telephone metadata the number called when and for how long particularly when it is paired with public information available from services such as Google Yelp and Facebook The value of the data which is not subject to the same legal protections as the content of peoples communications has long been recognized by the security services As Stewart Baker the former general counsel at the US National Security Agency NSA put it in the aftermath of Edward Snowdens revelations Metadata absolutely tells you everything about somebodys life Patrick Mutchler a computer security researcher at Stanford said that while the power of metadata was understood by those gathering the information the public was largely in the dark because so few published studies have revealed how rich the data is That makes it difficult for people with strong opinions about these programmes to fight them Now we have hard evidence we can point to that didnt exist in the past he said For the study the researchers signed up 823 people who agreed to have metadata collected from their phones through an Android app The app also received information from their Facebook accounts which the scientists used to check the accuracy of their results In all the researchers gathered metadata on more than 250000 calls and over 12m texts Analysts who logged into the NSAs metadatagathering system were initially allowed to examine data up to three hops away from an individual A call from the target individuals phone to another number was one hop From that phone to another was two hops And so on The records available to analysts stretched back for five years The collection window has now been restricted to two hops and 18 months at most Writing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Mutchler describes how on a shoestring budget he and fellow graduate student Jonathan Mayer uncovered a wealth of personal information some of it sensitive about people who took part in the study Through automatic and manual searches they identified 82 of peoples names The same technique gave them the names of businesses the people had called When these were plotted on a map they revealed clusters of local businesses which the scientists speculated surrounded the persons home address In this way they named the city people lived in 57 of the time and were nearly 90 accurate in placing people within 50 miles of their home Mutchler believes some of the misses came from people not updating their Facebook page when they moved out of their parents home for example to go to college The scientists next delved into more personal territory Using a simple computer program to analyse peoples call patterns they inferred who among the study volunteers was in a relationship Once they knew the owner of a particular number had a partner identifying the significant other was easy they report For the final part of the study the researchers delved even deeper to see what sensitive information they could glean from telephone metadata They gathered details on calls made to and from a list of organizations including hospitals pharmacies religious groups legal services firearms retailers and repair firms From these they pieced together some extraordinary vignettes from peoples lives The metadata from one person in the study showed they had a long call from a cardiology centre spoke briefly with a medical laboratory answered a number of short calls from a local pharmacy and then made calls to a hotline for abnormal heartrate monitoring devices Another participant made frequent calls to a local gun supplier that specialized in semiautomatic rifles and later placed a number of long calls to the customer support hotline run by a major gun manufacturer that produced the rifles The metadata from two others suggested one had multiple sclerosis and the other had just become pregnant All of this should be taken as an indication of what is possible with two graduate students and limited resources said Mutchler who argues that the findings should make policymakers think twice before authorizing mass surveillance programmes Largescale metadata surveillance programmes like the NSAs will necessarily expose highly confidential information about ordinary citizens the scientists write adding To strike an appropriate balance between national security and civil liberties future policymaking must be informed by input from relevant sciences Ross Anderson professor of security engineering at Cambridge University said the study provided numbers that discussions can now be based on With the right analytics running over nationscale communications data you can infer huge amounts of sensitive information on everyone We always suspected that of course but heres the data,The mass collection of telephone records by government surveillance programmes poses a threat to the personal privacy of ordinary people say US researchers They used basic phone logs to identify people and find out confidential information about their lives With metadata on peoples calls and texts but not the content of

confidential information about some people They discovered that one man had a gun and that another man had a heart problem Other data told them about a new pregnancy and a person with multiple sclerosis The results show the extraordinary power of telephone metadata that is the number called when and for how long particularly when you use it together with public information from services

from their phones through an Android app The app also received information from their Facebook accounts which the scientists used to check the accuracy of their results In total the researchers

about people who took part in the study They could find out 82 of peoples names The same technique gave them the names of businesses the people had called When these were marked on a map they showed

42,More than a third of all women worldwide 356 will experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime usually from a male partner according to the first comprehensive study of its kind from the World Health Organization WHO The report reveals the shocking extent of attacks on women from the men with whom they share their lives with 30 of women being attacked by partners It also finds that a large proportion of murders of women 38 are carried out by intimate partners These findings send a powerful message that violence against women is a global health problem of epidemic proportions said Dr Margaret Chan director general of the WHO We also see that the worlds health systems can and must do more for women who experience violence The highest levels of violence against women are in Africa where nearly half of all women 456 will suffer physical or sexual violence In low and middleincome Europe the proportion is 272 Yet wealthier nations are not necessarily always safer for women a third of women in highincome countries 327 will experience violence at some stage in their lives Of the women who suffer violence 42 sustain injuries which can bring them to the attention of healthcare staff That says the report is often the first opportunity for violence in the home to be detected and for the woman to be offered help Violence has a profound effect on womens health Some arrive at hospital with broken bones while others suffer pregnancyrelated complications and mental illness The two reports from the WHO one on the prevalence of violence the other offering guidelines to healthcare staff on helping women are the work of Dr Claudia GarciaMoreno lead specialist in gender reproductive rights sexual health and adolescence at WHO and Professor Charlotte Watts an epidemiologist who specializes in gender violence and health from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine For the first time we have compared data from all over the world on the magnitude of partner violence and sexual violence by nonpartners and the impact of these sorts of violence on health said GarciaMoreno These included HIV and other sexually transmitted infections depression women turning to alcohol unwanted pregnancies and lowbirthweight babies There were variations in the rates of violence against women in different regions of the world but said GarciaMoreno in whatever region we looked at it is unacceptably high Even in highincome countries 232 of women will suffer physical andor sexual violence from a partner in their lives their data from 81 countries shows The global figure for women attacked by partners was 30 More sexual assaults and rapes by acquaintances or strangers are reported in highincome countries than elsewhere the report says that 126 of women in wealthy countries will be sexually attacked by a nonpartner in their lives which is higher than the African rate of 119 But the data on such crimes is not well collected in all regions The authors say that their previous research shows that bettereducated women are less likely to suffer violence as are those who have jobs although not in all regions There is a need to tackle social norms said Watts What is societys attitude concerning the acceptability of certain forms of violence against women she asked In some societies it is not OK but not all I think the numbers are a wakeup call for all of us to pay more attention to this issue said GarciaMoreno Over the past decade there has been increasing recognition of the problem she said but one has to recognize that it is a complex problem We dont have a vaccine or a pill The new WHO clinical and policy guidelines recommend training for healthcare staff in recognizing the signs of domestic violence and sexual assault but they rule out general screening there is not a case for asking every woman who arrives in a clinic whether she has been subjected to violence But if you see a woman coming back several times with undisclosed injuries you should be asking about domestic violence said GarciaMoreno When I was training in medical school it wasnt something you learned or knew about Years later I was sometimes in a situation where I could tell there was something else going on in the woman I was interviewing but didnt have any sense that domestic violence was the issue Now I think I would handle the interview very differently,According to a report by the World Health Organization WHO 356 of all women around the world will experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime usually from a male partner

135,Opposition to Western Australias shark cull has intensi ed as thousands of people took to beaches across the continent to call on the states premier to end the policy and RSPCA Australia and Virgin Atlantic owner Richard Branson spoke out against it The controversial catching and killing of sharks longer than three metres began after what the state government called an unprecedented number of shark attacks on Western Australias coast which saw a 35yearold surfer killed in November 2013 He was the sixth person to die from a shark attack in two years However according to the Shark Attack File Australia as a whole has averaged one shark related fatality a year for the last 50 years Kate Faehrmann a board member at the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society said from a protest in Perth Weve been saying all along that this policy wont work Drumlines used to catch the sharks are indiscriminate killers Theyll kill sharks whether theyre one two three metres or more as well as dolphins turtles and other things Thats why the community doesnt want it Thousands of people protested on Perths Cottesloe Beach and Sydneys Manly Beach as well as hundreds at Glenelg in south west Adelaide and at beaches in Victoria and Queensland Faehrmann said the protests had shown Australians wanted sharks protected Whats amazing is so many people in Australia love sharks This has demonstrated something about the national psyche that despite Jaws despite all the fear people are coming out in their thousands across the country to say Thats their ocean We respect them we love them and we dont want them killed Anthony Joyce a surfer who once had his foot caught in a sharks mouth said The number of sharks they are going to kill is going to make no difference in the scheme of things The state government has refused to provide a running tally of sharks killed though there have been reports of sharks smaller than three metres being released after getting caught on drumlines oating drums anchored to the sea bed with bait hanging on hooks beneath them Conservationists argue there is no evidence the cull will reduce the number of shark attacks on humans as no previous cull has solely used drumlines Researchers at the University of Western Australia say the recent spate of shark attacks in the state may have more to do with the state having the fastestgrowing population in Australia rather than a rising number of sharks Richard Peirce chairman of the UKbased conservation charity the Shark Trust said that the cull would be ineffective and potentially lure more predators towards the coast The activity in Western Australia is compounding the human tragedy of shark attacks It is very sad that a government that could be seen to take positive initiatives with regards to shark human interactions by trialling alternatives to indiscriminate killing has ignored the best advice and opted for an approach that is ineffective and counterproductive he said The indiscriminate nature of drumlines is often overlooked even if monitored through the day leaving the lines in overnight has the potential to attract other predators into the area attracted by those sharks and other species hooked and injured Globally in 2012 there were 80 unprovoked attacks by sharks seven of which proved fatal compared to nearly 100m sharks killed by humans each year RSPCA Australia released a statement saying it believes the cull is unjusti ed There is no evidence that the increase in attacks is a result of increasing shark numbers Rather it is consistent with a changing population and human behaviour that is there are greater numbers of people in the water it said Richard Branson told Fairfax Radio the policy was back ring Im sure one of the reasons Western Australia Premier Colin Barnett did it was because he was thinking it would encourage tourism Its going to do quite the reverse I think Youre advertising a problem that doesnt exist in a major way and youre deterring people from wanting to come to Perth and your beautiful countryside around it All youre going to achieve I think is to worry people unnecessarily,Thousands of people protested on
