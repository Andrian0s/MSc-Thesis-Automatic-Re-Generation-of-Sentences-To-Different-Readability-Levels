34,For 85 years it was just a grey blob on classroom maps of the solar system But on 15 July we saw Pluto in high resolution for the first time The images show dramatic mountains made from solid water ice as big as the Alps or the Rockies The extraordinary images of the former ninth planet and its large moon Charon were sent four billion miles back to Earth from the New Horizons spacecraft Alan Stern the missions principal investigator said New Horizons is returning amazing results The data look absolutely gorgeous and Pluto and Charon are just mindblowing John Spencer a mission scientist said that one of the biggest surprises was the discovery that there are mountains in the Kuiper belt The Kuiper belt is the solar systems mysterious third zone where Pluto is with about 100000 smaller icy objects He said the mountains are around 3000 metres high and several hundred miles across Pluto used to be the ninth planet but since 2006 it has been a dwarf planet The NASA press conference began with spectacular images of the sun and the eight official planets Stern said the images from New Horizons were just the beginning and that we would learn more about the planet soon Scientists believe the mountains on Pluto are made from water ice with just a thin cover of methane and nitrogen Water ice is strong enough to hold up big mountains The images are the first to show ice mountains except those found on the moons of giant planets The images are so detailed that if the spacecraft flew over London we would be able to see the runways at Heathrow airport It is five billion kilometres to Pluto This means it takes New Horizons hours to send back a picture and it will take 16 months to send back all the data The team also said that the heartshaped area on Pluto will be called the Tombaugh Regio after Clyde Tombaugh who discovered the dwarf planet in 1930 The image of Charon shows an area of cliffs about 1000km long The image also shows a dramatic canyon 7 to 9km deep Cathy Olkin a mission scientist said Charon just blew our socks off when we saw the new image The team is so excited Pluto is two thirds rock surrounded by a lot of ice The temperature is about minus 230C The 460m spacecraft is continuing its journey into the Kuiper belt Scientists hope that it will help us to see and understand more of the ancient solar system and the origins of planets It may even help to explain how the Earth was made Andrew Coates the head of planetary science at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory said Its a really thrilling time for solar system exploration NASA says that the spacecraft will be able to keep recording and sending images until the mid 2030s Then its plutonium power source will run out and it will drift outwards towards the edge of the solar system and deep space beyond,For 85 years it was little more than a featureless grey blob on classroom maps of the solar system but on 15 July Pluto was seen in high resolution for the first time revealing dramatic mountain ranges made from solid water ice on a scale to rival the Alps or the Rockies The extraordinary images of the former ninth planet and its large moon Charon beamed 4bn miles back to Earth from the New Horizons spacecraft mark the climax of a mission that has been quietly underway for nearly a decade Alan Stern the missions principal investigator described the images as a home run for the team New Horizons is returning amazing results already The data look absolutely gorgeous and Pluto and Charon are just mindblowing One of the biggest surprises was the discovery that there are mountains in the Kuiper belt the solar systems mysterious third zone where Pluto sits amid around 100000 smaller icy objects John Spencer a mission scientist said the mountains appear to be around 11000ft high and several hundred miles across These are pretty significant mountains The detailed image of one edge of the dwarf planet showed not a single crater hinting that the surface has been recently paved over by geological activity which could include dramatic geysers blasting plumes of ice into the atmosphere or cryovolcanoes that erupt in explosions of ice rather than molten rock In a nod to Plutos former status as the ninth planet until it was downgraded to a dwarf planet in 2006 the NASA press conference began with a rundown of spectacular images of the sun and the eight official planets Weve brought what was previously a blurred point of light into focus said Dwayne Brown NASA spokesman as scientists and journalists waited for the image to be unveiled Stern described the images as just skimming the surface of what would be learnt about the planet during the coming year They have already produced some surprises Scientists believe the mountains are made from water ice with just a thin veneer of exotic ices methane and nitrogen You cant make mountains out of methane and nitrogen said Spencer Water ice is strong enough to hold up big mountains and thats what we think were seeing here This is the first time weve seen this The methane and nitrogen are just a coating The mountains on Pluto are likely to have formed no more than 100m years ago extremely recently given the 456bnyearold solar system This suggests the closeup region which covers about 1 of Plutos surface may still be geologically active The images are the first to show ice mountains outside of the moons of giant planets and raises the question of what kind of geological process could be generating the mountainous landscape The structures together with the smoothness of Plutos surface suggest that geological activity is taking place and smoothing over depressions caused by asteroid impacts Scientists believe this paving process could be the result of internal heat that softens rock and ice or from snowfalls that cover the surface For scale the images are so detailed that if the craft were flying over London we would be able to pick out the runways at Heathrow airport The distance to Pluto 5bn km means it takes New Horizons hours to send back a single picture and it will take 16 months to send all the data it has accumulated during the flyby The team also announced that the heartshaped feature visible on Pluto will now be known as the Tombaugh Regio in honour of Clyde Tombaugh who discovered the dwarf planet in 1930 The new view of Charon reveals a varied complex terrain An area of cliffs and troughs stretching about 1000km suggests widespread fracturing of Charons surface which could also be the result of geological activity The image also shows a dramatic canyon estimated to be 7 to 9km deep Cathy Olkin a mission scientist said Charon just blew our socks off when we had the new image today The team has just been abuzz There is so much interesting science in this one image alone Pluto is thought to be composed of about two thirds rock encased in a lot of ice with surface temperatures of about minus 230C As the 460m mission travels onwards into the Kuiper belt scientists hope that it will open up a window on the ancient solar system and the origins of planets potentially helping to explain the formation of the Earth itself Andrew Coates head of planetary science at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory said These Kuiper belt objects are the building blocks of the outer solar system Theyre all very cold its like a cosmic deep freeze Its the best way of preserving solar system history That is what is so fascinating about this Its a really thrilling time for solar system exploration In August 2015 mission scientists will choose which of two objects to visit next NASA estimates that the spacecraft will be able to keep recording and transmitting until the mid2030s Then its plutonium power source will run out and it will shut down drifting outwards towards the edge of the solar system and deep space beyond New Horizons also observed the smaller members of the Pluto system which includes four other moons Nix Hydra Styx and Kerberos A new sneakpeek image of Hydra is the first to reveal its apparent irregular shape and its size estimated to be about 43 by 33km New Horizons is a true mission of exploration showing us why basic scientific research is so important said John Grunsfeld associate administrator for NASAs Science Mission Directorate The mission has had nine years to build expectations about what we would see during closest approach to Pluto and Charon Today we get the first sampling of the scientific treasure collected during those critical moments and I can tell you it dramatically surpasses those high expectations The observations also indicate Hydras surface is probably coated with water ice Future images will reveal more clues about the formation of this and the other moon billions of years ago,test,ELE,ADV
129,When two people on a remote Pacific island saw a small boat washed up on the beach they decided to take a closer look Inside the boat they found a very thin man with long hair and a beard who said he drifted for 16 months after leaving Mexico more than 12500km away The man who was wearing only underpants told his rescuers that he drifted in the 73metre boat since he left Mexico for El Salvador in September 2012 A friend died at sea several months before he said His health isnt good but hes getting better said Ola Fjeldstad a Norwegian anthropology student doing research on Ebon Island one of the Marshall Islands The man said his name was Jos Ivan He said he survived by catching turtles and birds There was no fishing equipment on the boat but a turtle was inside when it washed up The boat looks like it has been in the water for a long time Fjeldstad said According to Fjeldstad the people who found the man took him to a nearby island which is so remote it has only one phone line and no internet to meet the mayor The mayor contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Majuro the Marshall Islands capital People at the ministry said that they were waiting for more details and that the man will probably go to the capital Hes staying at the local council house and a family is feeding him said Fjeldstad He also said that the man had a basic health check and had low blood pressure but no serious problems and was able to walk Were giving him a lot of water and hes getting stronger Fraser Christian who teaches people how to survive at sea said that if the mans story was true it would be amazing but not unique It was possible to catch turtles or small fish by hand he said because they will come close to a small boat to shelter underneath it Christian advises people who have to eat turtles to start with their eyes lots of fluid then drink the blood The main dangers for castaways are cold and a lack of drinking water The basic rule is no water no food You need water to digest protein If you have no fresh water and it doesnt rain for a few days so you cant collect rainwater you will die Also some people are more able to survive than others Stories of survival in the Pacific Ocean are not rare In 2006 three Mexicans made international headlines when they were found drifting near the Marshall Islands also in a small boat They said they survived for nine months at sea on a diet of rainwater raw fish and seabirds But Cliff Downing who teaches sea survival to sailors said he wasnt sure about the latest story It just doesnt sound right to me There are 1001 hazards that would make his survival for so long very unlikely,When two islanders spotted a small fibreglass boat washed up on a remote Pacific atoll they decided to take a closer look What they found inside was a tale of adventure and unlikely survival to rival the blockbuster book and film Life of Pi an emaciated man with long hair and a beard who claimed to have been drifting for 16 months after setting out from Mexico more than 12500km away The man dressed only in a ragged pair of underpants told his rescuers that he had been adrift in the 73metre fibreglass boat whose engines were missing their propellers since he left Mexico for El Salvador in September 2012 A companion had died at sea several months earlier he said His condition isnt good but hes getting better said Ola Fjeldstad a Norwegian anthropology student doing research on the isolated Ebon Atoll part of the Marshall Islands archipelago The man had said his name was Jos Ivan and he had indicated that he survived by catching turtles and birds with his bare hands but because he spoke only Spanish further details were sketchy There was no fishing equipment on the boat but a turtle was inside when it washed up The boat is really scratched up and looks like it has been in the water for a long time Fjeldstad told reporters According to the researcher the islanders who found the man took him to the main island in the atoll which is so remote it has only one phone line and no internet to meet the mayor Ione de Brum who contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Majuro the Marshall Islands capital Officials at the ministry said that they were awaiting more details and expected the man to be taken to the capital The government airlines only plane that can land at Ebon is currently undergoing maintenance and is not expected to return to service for several days Officials are considering sending a boat to pick up the castaway Hes staying at the local council house and a family is feeding him said Fjeldstad who added that the man had a basic health check and was found to have low blood pressure but did not appear to have any lifethreatening conditions and was able to walk with the aid of men on the island Weve been giving him a lot of water and hes gaining strength Fraser Christian who teaches maritime survival courses at his Coastal Survival School in Dorset said the mans story if true would be remarkable but far from unique It was entirely possible to catch turtles or small fish by hand he said since they are inquisitive and they will approach a small boat to shelter underneath it Christian advises clients who find themselves forced to eat turtles to start with their eyes lots of fluid then move on to the blood The major problems the man would have faced were exposure and dehydration The basic rule is no water no food You need water to digest protein If you have no fresh water and it doesnt rain for a few days so you cant collect rainwater you have basically had it Individual physiology also plays a part he said with some people better suited to survival than others The mental thing is key and thats often down to peoples situation in life and how used they are to dealing mentally with hardship Stories of survival in the vast Pacific Ocean are not uncommon In 2006 three Mexicans made international headlines when they were discovered drifting also in a small fibreglass boat near the Marshall Islands They claimed to have survived for nine months at sea on a diet of rainwater raw fish and seabirds with their hope kept alive by reading the Bible But Cliff Downing who teaches sea survival to sailors said he was sceptical about the latest tale It just doesnt sound right to me There are 1001 hazards that would make his survival

161,People are talking a lot about loneliness at the moment The Office for National Statistics says that Britain is the loneliest place in Europe British people have fewer strong friendships than other Europeans and they know their neighbours less well Research at the University of Chicago has found that loneliness is twice as bad for older peoples health as obesity They also found that loneliness causes almost as many deaths as poverty This is shocking but these studies do not talk about loneliness in younger adults In 2010 a Mental Health Foundation survey found that loneliness was a bigger worry for young people than for the elderly The 18 to 34yearolds in the survey felt lonely more often worried more about feeling alone and felt more depressed because of loneliness than people over 55 We know that loneliness is a problem for the elderly and there are day centres and charities to help them says Sam Challis of the mental health charity Mind but young people over 21 are too old for youth services This is not good because loneliness can cause mental health problems loneliness causes stress depression paranoia anxiety addiction and it can cause suicide But what can young people do to prevent loneliness One researcher says that social media and the internet can be both a good thing and a problem They are a good thing when they allow us to communicate with friends and family far away but not when they replace facetoface contact People present perfect versions of themselves online and we expect to have social lives like the lives we see in the media says Challis If we compare the perfect lives of our friends with our own lives this can make us want to stay at home alone A study of social media at the University of Michigan in 2013 found that using technology to help you meet new people can be a good thing And if you cant go out the internet can help you For example Mumsnet an online network for parents can help you feel less alone when you are at home with young children Helplines can also reduce loneliness at least in the short term One in four of men who call the emotional support charity Samaritans say they are lonely Get Connected is a free helpline for young people where they can get help with emotional and mental health problems caused by loneliness At work it can be a good idea to tell your employer how youre feeling Talking to your colleagues may seem like a waste of time but it can help to protect us from the emotional and psychological problems caused by working too hard According to recent research loneliness is killing the elderly and with an ageing population we should try to reduce our isolation before it is too late Getting older doesnt have to mean getting lonelier says Ruth Sutherland the chief executive of the relationship counselling service Relate But it is very important to create goodquality relationships earlier in life,Loneliness has finally become a hot topic the Office for National Statistics has found Britain to be the loneliest country in Europe British people are less likely to have strong friendships or know their neighbours than residents anywhere else in the EU and a relatively high proportion of them have no one to rely on in a crisis Meanwhile research by Professor John Cacioppo at the University of Chicago has found loneliness to be twice as bad for older peoples health as obesity and almost as great a cause of death as poverty But shocking as this is such studies overlook the loneliness epidemic among younger adults In 2010 the Mental Health Foundation found loneliness to be a greater concern among young people than the elderly The 18 to 34yearolds surveyed were more likely to feel lonely often to worry about feeling alone and to feel depressed because of loneliness than the over55s Loneliness is a recognized problem among the elderly there are day centres and charities to help them says Sam Challis an information manager at the mental health charity Mind but when young people reach 21 theyre too old for youth services This is problematic because of the close relationship between loneliness and mental health it is linked to increased stress depression paranoia anxiety addiction cognitive decline and is a known factor in suicide In a new essay Paul Farmer the chief executive of Mind and Jenny Edwards the chief executive of the Mental Health Foundation say it can be both a cause and effect of mental health problems But what can young people do to combat loneliness Dr Grant Blank a survey research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute points out that social media and the internet can be a boon and a problem They are beneficial when they enable us to communicate with distant loved ones but not when they replace facetoface contact People present an idealized version of themselves online and we expect to have social lives like those portrayed in the media says Challis Comparing friends seemingly perfect lives with ours can lead us to withdraw socially While meditation techniques and apps such as Headspace are trendy solutions frequently recommended for a range of mental health problems theyre not necessarily helpful for loneliness as they actively encourage us to dwell alone on our thoughts Youd be better off addressing the underlying causes of being lonely first whats stopping you going out and seeing people asks Challis Indeed a study of social media at the University of Michigan in 2013 found that while Facebook reduces life satisfaction using technology to help you meet new people can be beneficial And if for whatever reason you are unable to venture outside the internet can bring solace Mumsnet has been an absolute godsend for Maddy Matthews 19 a student with a twomonthold daughter Since the birth she rarely sees her university friends and her partner works most evenings In the first few days I was up late at night feeding her and I was worried I was doing something wrong Being able to post on Mumsnet has helped me feel less alone Helplines can also reduce loneliness at least in the short term One in four men who call the emotional support charity Samaritans mention loneliness or isolation and Get Connected is a free confidential helpline for young people where they can seek help with emotional and mental health issues often linked to loneliness There are also support services on websites such as Minds that can remind you youre not alone At work it can be beneficial to tell your employer how youre feeling John Binns who advises businesses on mental health and wellbeing was admitted to hospital for stressrelated depression in 2007 and took two months off work He felt as if there was no one to talk to and he wasnt close enough to colleagues for them to notice the changes in his behaviour Greater openness with his employer and colleagues made his return to work easier Often people find that colleagues are more supportive than theyd expected Mine started to reach out asking me to lunch and reassuring me that the world hadnt moved on that much since Id left Office chitchat may seem like a waste of time but it helps to cushion us from the emotional and psychological effects of work strain If you form connections with your team you might be stressed but not isolated says Rick Hughes the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapys BACP lead adviser for the workplace We treat the networks we have as incidental but theyre fundamental to our wellbeing says Nicky Forsythe a psychotherapist and the founder of Talk for Health a social enterprise that trains people to give and receive peer support in groups The most important thing is to have a regular time and place to reflect on your life and to have an empathetic listener For developing personal skills such as empathy counselling can help The BACP website allows you to search for counsellors in your area A problem aired is a problem shared and sometimes you need to talk to someone impartial and independent of your friends and family says Hughes Most universities offer students such counselling and many run group sessions that specifically address loneliness If recent research is to be believed loneliness is killing the elderly and with an ageing population we should aim to reduce our isolation before it is too late Getting older doesnt have to mean getting lonelier says Ruth Sutherland the chief executive of the relationship counselling service Relate in a new report But much of this rests on laying the foundations to goodquality relationships earlier in

how Ferguson told his staff the news I found out this morning when I came to the club he said He asked us to go into his office and told us his decision Im sure he thought hard about it I wish him well for the future Hes been fantastic for this club and I hope all the fans give the new manager the same support,Sir Alex Ferguson will retire as Manchester United manager at the end of the season in the 27th year of a tenure that has made him the most successful manager in British football While he will become a United director and ambassador the club will now have to find someone to replace a man who has won 13 English Premier League titles two Champions Leagues the Cup Winners Cup five FA Cups and four League Cups Regarding his decision Ferguson said The decision to retire is one that I have thought a great deal about and one that I have not taken lightly It is the right time It was important to me to leave an organization in the strongest possible shape and I believe I have done so The quality of this leaguewinning squad and the balance of ages within it bodes well for continued success at the highest level whilst the structure of the youth setup will ensure that the longterm future of the club remains a bright one Our training facilities are amongst the finest in global sport and our home Old Trafford is rightfully regarded as one of the leading venues in the world Going

31,On the market square in Rjukan stands a statue of the person who created the town a Norwegian engineer and businessman called Sam Eyde The great man looks north across the square at the side of a mountain in front of him Behind him to the south is the 1800metre mountain known as Gaustatoppen Between the mountains along the narrow Vestfjord valley is the small town that Eyde built at the beginning of the last century for his factory workers Eyde used the power of the 100metre Rjukanfossen waterfall to make hydroelectricity in what was at that time the worlds biggest power plant But one thing he couldnt do was change the sun Deep in its eastwest valley with high mountains all around Rjukan and the 3400 people who live there are in shadow for half the year In the daytime from late September to midMarch the town three hours northwest of Oslo is not completely dark but its certainly not bright Now high on the mountain opposite Eydes statue 450 metres above the town three large solarpowered computercontrolled mirrors follow the movement of the sun across the sky They reflect the sunshine down on to the square and fill it in bright sunlight Its the sun says Ingrid Sparbo she lifts her face to the light and closes her eyes Sparbo has lived all her life in Rjukan and says This is so warming Not just physically but mentally Its mentally warming Two young mothers bring their children into the square and stand in the sun On a freezing day an elderly couple sit on one of the new benches and they smile at the warmth on their faces Children smile Lots of people take photographs A shop assistant Silje Johansen says its awesome Just awesome Electrical engineer Eivind Toreid says Its a funny thing Not real sunlight but very similar Like a spotlight Heidi Fieldheim says she heard all about it on the radio This will bring much happiness she says Across the road in the Nye Tider caf sits the man who created this happiness Martin Andersen is a 40yearold artist who moved to Rjukan in the summer of 2001 Andersen had the idea for an artwork he calls the Solspeil or Sun mirror at the end of September one year Every day we took our young child for a walk he says and every day I realized we had to go a little further down the valley to find the sun By 28 September the sun completely disappears from Rjukans market square It doesnt reappear until 12 March In the months between September and March Andersen says We would look up and see blue sky above and the sun high on the mountain but the only way we could get to it was to go out of town Twelve years after he first dreamed of his Solspeil a German company that specializes in CSP concentrated solar power brought in by helicopter the three 17squaremetre glass mirrors that are now high above the market square in Rjukan And it really works Some people were against the mirrors at first but now even they agree that it works I was strongly against it says Nils Eggerud Like many others he felt they needed the money for other things for extra carers to look after Rjukans old people perhaps or better schools cycle paths and roads And I still dont know about the maintenance costs he says What will they be who will pay them But well it feels nice standing here And really you just have to look at the peoples faces In his office with a view of the square Rjukans young mayor Steinar Bergsland is less interested in the cost and more interested in the benefits the mirrors might bring to the town Already Bergsland says there are more visitors than usual and Rjukans shopkeepers are making more money than usual The town had to pay just 1 million krone 100000 of the mirrors total 5million krone cost The rest came from the government and a local business And says Bergsland just look out of the window Look at those happy faces Now its here people love it,On the market square in Rjukan stands a statue of the towns founder a noted Norwegian engineer and industrialist called Sam Eyde The great man stares northwards across the square at an almost sheer mountainside in front of him Behind him to the south rises the equally sheer 1800metre peak known as Gaustatoppen Between the mountains along the narrow Vestfjord valley lies the small but once mighty town that Eyde built in the early years of the last century to house the workers for his factories Eyde harnessed the power of the 100 metre Rjukanfossen waterfall to generate hydroelectricity in what was at the time the worlds biggest power plant But one thing he couldnt do was change the elevation of the sun Deep in its eastwest valley surrounded by high mountains Rjukan and its 3400 inhabitants are in shadow for half the year During the day from late September to midMarch the town three hours northwest of Oslo is not completely dark but its certainly not bright either Recently however Eydes statue has gazed out upon a sight that even he might have found startling High on the mountain opposite 450 metres above the town three large solarpowered computercontrolled mirrors steadily track the movement of the sun across the sky reflecting its rays down on to the square and bathing it in bright sunlight Its the sun grins Ingrid Sparbo disbelievingly lifting her face to the light and closing her eyes A retired secretary Sparbo has lived all her life in Rjukan and says people do sort of get used to the shade You end up not thinking about it really But this this is so warming Not just physically but mentally Its mentally warming Two young mothers wheel their children into the square and stand in the sun On a freezing day an elderly couple sit on one of the new benches smiling at the warmth on their faces Children beam Lots of people take photographs A shop assistant Silje Johansen says its awesome Just awesome Pushing his childs buggy electrical engineer Eivind Toreid is more cautious Its a funny thing he says Not real sunlight but very like it Like a spotlight Heidi Fieldheim says she heard all about it on the radio But its far more than I expected she says This will bring much happiness Across the road in the Nye Tider caf sits the man responsible for this unexpected access to happiness Martin Andersen is a 40yearold artist who moved to Rjukan in the summer of 2001 The first inkling of an artwork Andersen called the Solspeil or Sun mirror came to him as the month of September began to fade Every day we would take our young child for a walk in the buggy he says and every day I realized we were having to go a little further down the valley to find the sun By 28 September the sun completely disappears from Rjukans market square It doesnt reappear until 12 March Throughout the seemingly endless intervening months Andersen says Wed look up and see blue sky above and the sun high on the mountain slopes but the only way we could get to it was to go out of town Its sad a town that people have to leave in order to feel the sun Twelve years after he first dreamed of his Solspeil a German company specializing in socalled CSP concentrated solar power helicoptered in the three 17sqm glass mirrors that now stand high above the market square in Rjukan It took he says a bit longer than wed imagined It really works There were objectors and plenty of them petitions and letterwriting campaigns and a Facebook page organized against what a large number of locals saw initially as a vanity project and above all a waste of money But even they now seem largely won over I was strongly against it admits Nils Eggerud Like many others he felt the money could have been better spent elsewhere on a couple of extra carers to look after Rjukans old people perhaps or improved school facilities cycle paths a bit of rural road resurfacing And I still have my doubts about the ongoing maintenance costs he says What will they be who will pay them But well it does feel nice standing here And really you just have to look at the peoples faces In his office overlooking the square Rjukans energetic young mayor Steinar Bergsland is interested not so much in the cost but in the benefits the mirrors might bring to the town Already Bergsland says visitor numbers are up for the time of year and Rjukans shopkeepers have reported their takings following suit A hitech company is interested in relocating to Rjukan attracted by the cuttingedge technology on view at the top of the mountain and the publicity it has attracted This is a powerful symbol for Rjukan Bergsland says and helped by assorted government grants and a donation from a local business the town needed to find just 1m krone 100000 of the mirrors total 5mkrone cost And seen against the towns 650m krone annual budget he points out 1m krone really wasnt very much to pay for something that gives us a far far better chance of raising the money we need for better schools and more nursing care And just look out of the window Look at those happy faces Now its actually here people love it,test,ELE,ADV
69,Governments in Europe dream of nding a magic solution to rising unemployment But in the poorest parts of the EU unemployment continues to rise Now in Sardinia Italy a mayor thinks he has found an answer to his towns unemployment problem Valter Piscedda the mayor of Elmas a small town near Sardinias capital Cagliari wants to pay residents to leave The town will pay for ten unemployed local people to take English lessons get on a cheap ight and look for jobs in other parts of Europe This idea comes from common sense and experience he told the Guardian In the past year and a half especially in the past few months I have seen young people almost every day who have lost hope that they will nd work Some ask for help in nding work here Others have tried everything and now they want to go and gain work experience abroad life experience too So he decided to help people who want to gain experience abroad Sardinia and also much of southern and central Italy is struggling with high unemployment Unemployment was at 177 in the second quarter of 2014 according to Italys National Institute of Statistics More than 54 of people under 25 are out of work For the Adesso Parto Now Im leaving programme Elmas will give 12000 to the rst ten applicants aged between 18 and 50 The applicants must be out of work and have lived in the town for three years They do not have to be university educated and they must not earn more than 15000 The idea of helping people to leave is sensitive at a time when many Italians many of them clever young graduates are leaving their country every year But Piscedda believes that the people he is sending away might return and give me back 100 times what we gave them More importantly he wants the scheme to help the people most in need In Elmas the scheme has got mixed reactions There is little work here said Alessandro Macis The opportunity to go abroad to learn about the workplace and experience other cultures can be very worthwhile The son of a friend of mine who didnt study much is in London and hes doing very well He started as a waiter Now hes a cook and hes learning English Others were not sure I heard about it but I thought it was strange If you have that money to pay for people to go away why dont you use that money to keep them here said Consuelo Melis who works in a local cafe But Piscedda says The work I can create as mayor is temporary I can ask someone to clean a piazza I can ask them to clean it again I can ask someone to clean the streets But these are all temporary things that give nothing more than a little bit of money for a few months,Governments across Europe dream of nding a magic solution to rising unemployment But in the hardesthit parts of the EU joblessness rates continue to creep up and the rhetoric does little to shorten the dole queue Now in a struggling corner of Italy one mayor thinks he has found an answer to his towns chronic lack of work although rather than a solution it appears to some to be more of an admission of defeat Valter Piscedda the centre left mayor of Elmas a small town near Sardinias capital Cagliari wants to pay residents to leave The council will pay for ten unemployed locals to take intensive English lessons board a cheap ight and look for jobs elsewhere in Europe This is above all an idea born of common sense and experience he told the Guardian Over the past year and a half especially in the past few months I have been receiving young people almost every day who are despairing about their search for work Some are looking here and ask for a hand in nding it here Others have tried everything and are so discouraged that they no longer want to stay and wait And they want to go and gain work experience abroad life experience too So my reasoning was this put everything in place that the council administration can put in place so that those who want to gain experience abroad are able to he said As the national economy continues to falter Sardinia along with much of southern and central Italy is grappling with high unemployment with the overall joblessness rate at 177 in the second quarter of 2014 according to Italys National Institute of Statistics Istat More than 54 of people under 25 are out of work For the Adesso Parto Now Im leaving programme Elmass council has allocated 12000 on a rstcome rstserved basis to applicants aged between 18 and 50 As long as they are out of work and have lived in the town for three years they are eligible They do not have to be university educated and their annual income must be no more than 15000 The idea of encouraging people to up sticks is sensitive at a time when oods of Italians many of them bright young graduates are leaving their country every year But Piscedda who belongs to the Democratic Party of the Prime Minister Matteo Renzi denies he is facilitating a brain drain and believes that the people he is sending away may well return and give me back 100 times what they were given More importantly he wants the scheme to give a legup to those most in need Its a programme for those with no other resource its the lastchance saloon Its about allowing them the dignity of not having to ask a friend for money or place burdens on families that cannot do it he said Earlier in 2014 he added the council launched a scheme whereby businesses were given nancial incentives to hire young workers from Elmas We advertised 20 of these positions he said We got 120 applications In Elmas the scheme has provoked mixed reactions The reality is that there is little work here said Alessandro Macis The opportunity to go abroad to learn about the workplace and experience other cultures can be very worthwhile The son of a friend of mine who didnt study much has ended up in London and hes really nding his way He started as a waiter Now hes a cook and hes learning English Others were perplexed I heard about it but I thought it was strange If you have that money to pay for people to go away why dont you use that money to keep them here said Consuelo Melis who works behind the bar in a local cafe On Twitter one of many reactions was disbelief The states admission of defeat commented Marco Patavino Institutions are raising the white ag remarked Carlo Mazzaggio Piscedda however is undeterred remarking of his online critics Probably they are people that arent in need Every day I deal with peoples problems and I have to do something to try to solve them These people if they had an alternative they wouldnt be asking for help The work I can create as mayor is temporary I can have a piazza cleaned I can have it cleaned again I can have the streets cleaned But these are all temporary things that give nothing beyond that little bit of money for a few months I want to go

63,When Larry Pizzi first heard about electric bikes nearly 20 years ago he asked Why would anyone want to spoil a bike by putting a motor and batteries on it Its a question that some people still ask Many bicycle shops in the US do not sell ebikes Pizzi is CEO of Currie Technologies the number one seller of ebikes in the US He believes that things will change very soon Other people who sell bikes agree Familiar brands including Trek Raleigh and Specialized all offer electric bikes and they believe that the market is going to grow The US is different from other countries when it comes to electric bikes Nearly 32 million ebikes were sold in 2014 most of them in China where people mostly use them for transportation They are popular in many parts of Europe too Theyre common in the Netherlands and Switzerland German postal workers use them and BMW sells one for about 3000 Electric bikes are different from motorcycles or mopeds which use motors you pedal an electric bike with or without help from an electric motor Riding an ebike feels like riding a normal bike with a strong wind behind you the motor just helps you go faster or climb hills You can usually ride ebicycles on bike lanes and they cant travel faster than 20mph Ebikes are banned in some states in the US including New York Some bike shops dont like putting motors on bicycles because it makes them too heavy Some ebikes weigh nearly 30kg Ebikes are also expensive While cheap bikes sell for just 700 you will pay at least 1500 for a quality ebike with a good battery The best bikes cost more than 3000 But ebike technology particularly the batteries is improving Batteries are getting smaller theyre getting lighter theyre getting more reliable and they are lasting longer says Don DiCostanza the CEO of Pedego an electric bikemaker and retailer Perhaps most importantly more cities are building bike lanes so bicycle commuting has become more popular Electric bikes make commuting more practical and fun because people dont have to worry about hills strong winds tiredness and sweat Most of our customers are baby boomers who want to have the cycling experience they had as a kid says Pedegos Don DiCostanza The main reason they stopped riding bikes was because of hills Pedego has opened nearly 60 stores in the US ElectroBike has 30 stores in Mexico It opened its first American store in Venice Beach California in 2014 and hopes to have 25 US stores in a year CEO Craig Anderson says We want to help reduce traffic help reduce our carbon footprint and encourage a healthy lifestyle He tells customers Ride this bike once and try not to smile Curries Larry Pizzi thinks that ebikes will become popular in North America A lot of young people are using ebikes for transportation instead of cars There is even a cargo bike with a stronger motor and rack at the back You can carry two children says Pizzi You can carry 45kg of shopping Its a minivan alternative,When Larry Pizzi a veteran bicycle industry executive first heard about electric bikes nearly 20 years ago he asked Why would anyone want to screw up a bike by putting a motor and batteries on it Its a question that still puzzles traditionalists Bicycle shops have been slow to stock ebikes even though they have been around since the late 1990s Sales in the US have been modest Pizzi who is now CEO of Currie Technologies the number one seller of ebikes in the US believes thats about to change Others in the industry agree Familiar brands including Trek Raleigh and Specialized all offer electric models and theyre betting the market is about to take off Were on the cusp of mainstream adoption Pizzi said There are more players entering the category it seems with every passing month The US is an outlier when it comes to electric bikes Nearly 32m ebikes were sold in 2014 the vast majority in China where they are primarily used for transportation They are popular in much of Europe too Theyre common in the Netherlands and Switzerland German postal workers use them to get around and BMW offers one for about 3000 Electric bikes are different from motorcycles or mopeds which rely on motorized power they are bicycles that can be pedalled with or without assistance from an electric motor Riding an ebike feels like riding a conventional bike with a brisk tailwind the motor helps you go faster or climb hills but its typically not the primary source of propulsion Unlike mopeds ebicycles are usually permitted on bike paths and they cant travel faster than 20mph Theres debate about how many electric bikes are sold in the US and there is no official count Estimates of annual sales range from about 50000 to 175000 Thats comparable to the number of electric cars sold in the US 118000 in 2014 Yet while many people are aware of the Nissan Leaf Chevy Volt and Tesla few have heard of ebike companies Currie Pedego or ElectroBike To succeed the electric bike business in the US must clear legal cultural and financial hurdles Ebikes are banned in some states including New York although the law isnt strictly enforced Traditionalists who own and staff bike shops dont like putting motors on bicycles citing among other things the added weight Some ebikes are close to 30kg Ebikes are also pricey While lowend models sell for as little as 700 Court Rye the founder and editor of ElectricBikeReviewcom a popular website says riders should expect to pay at least 1500 for a quality ebike with a good battery Topoftheline models cost more than twice that The companies that make and sell ebikes say they can overcome those obstacles Ebike technology particularly the batteries is improving Batteries are getting smaller theyre getting lighter theyre getting more reliable and they are lasting longer says Don DiCostanza the founder and CEO of Pedego an electric bikemaker and retailer Companies like Bosch the German electronics giant and Shimano the leading manufacturer of bicycle gears are entering the business which should help erode resistance from bike shops This has really caught the attention and the imagination of bicycle dealers says Curries Larry Pizzi Pedego and startup ElectroBike arent waiting for the shops to come around they are building their own stores In the meantime lobbying efforts are underway to permit the use of ebikes everywhere Perhaps most importantly as more cities build cycling infrastructure including dedicated bike lanes bicycle commuting has become more popular As the US Census Bureau reported in 2014 the number of bike commuters grew from about 488000 in 2000 to 786000 in 2012 Thats a larger percentage increase than that of any other commuting mode the report notes Electric bikes make commuting more practical and fun by easing worry about hills headwinds fatigue and sweat Most of our customers are ageing baby boomers who want to rekindle the experience they had as a kid says Pedegos Don DiCostanza The main reason they stopped riding bikes was because of hills Pedego has opened nearly 60 stores in the US and it has sold bikes to tour companies in San Francisco and Washington DC ElectroBike which operates 30 stores in Mexico opened its first American store in Venice Beach California in the autumn of 2014 and hopes to grow to 25 US stores in a year CEO Craig Anderson says We want to help reduce traffic help reduce our carbon footprint and promote a healthy lifestyle He tells customers Ride this once and try not to smile Startups like Pedego and ElectroBike will have to compete with big companies like Trek and Currie which in 2012 was acquired by the Accell Group a public company based in the Netherlands that is Europes market leader in ebikes Accell owns the Raleigh brand as well as Haibike an awardwinning German electric bike Accell has great expectations about ebikes in North America Curries Larry Pizzi says While baby boomers are still a very important segment were finding that a lot of younger people are using ebikes for

83,The Chief Medical Officer for England compared the problem of antibiotic resistance to the risks of international terrorism But each year the number of deaths around the world from bacterial resistance is far more than the number of deaths from terrorist attacks The World Health Organization says that each year more than 150000 people die from tuberculosis because of antibiotic resistance This is now a war A hundred years ago life expectancy in the UK was about 47 years for a man and 50 years for a woman Lots of young children died About 30 of all deaths were in children under the age of five mostly because of infectious disease But a child born in Britain today has more than a 25 chance of reaching their 100th birthday We can thank public health systems vaccination and antibiotics for this In intensive care antibiotic resistant bacteria are most common Here powerful antibiotics are used very often These drugs kill ordinary bacteria But they cannot kill strong bacteria that have begun to learn how to survive antibiotic drugs When I became a doctor in the 1990s I learnt about Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus MRSA is a bacteria that is resistant to methicillin and all other penicillins There were just a few drugs that could kill it for example vancomycin and teicoplanin But antibiotic resistant bacteria became more and more common In our hospitals and our doctors surgeries we use antiobiotics too often Also we have put antibiotics into the food chain when we grow food and when we put antibacterial drugs into food for farm animals We thought that antibiotics were something we could use forever We thought that companies would continue to make more and more antibiotics But this is no longer true We have found new more resistant bacteria The vancomycin that we used to treat MRSA infection no longer worked We found Vancomycin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus VRSA in our hospitals And other bacteria were becoming resistant too Today infections with organisms that are very resistant are common but fewer and fewer new antibiotic drugs are made It is more and more difficult to develop new drugs that can kill resistant bacteria Antibiotics have become drugs that are expensive to develop that are only used in short courses and that quickly stop working because of bacterial resistance This war against bacteria is different from all other wars There needs to be change in the way doctors give antibiotics and we need to use fewer antibiotics in farming And we have to give companies good reasons why they should make new antibiotics which will not make them lots of money Today antibiotic resistance has become a normal part of life Less than a hundred years after the discovery of penicillin we are beginning to lose the fight,Dame Sally Davies the Chief Medical Officer for England has likened the problem of antibiotic resistance to the risks presented by international terrorism While this might sound like an exaggeration the threat was actually if anything understated Each year the global number of deaths to which bacterial resistance contributes far outstrips those caused by terrorist attacks While it is difficult to track the global impact of antibiotic resistance across all bacterial species the World Health Organization estimates that for tuberculosis alone multidrug resistance accounts for more than 150000 deaths each year Antibiotic resistance is no longer an abstract risk this is now a war In the past hundred years our expectations of life and survival have changed beyond all recognition At the beginning of the twentieth century life expectancy in the UK stood at around 47 years of age for a man and 50 for a woman a number heavily affected by the very high rate of infant mortality in those days Around a third of all deaths occurred in children under the age of five largely because of infectious disease In contrast a child born in Britain today has a better than one in four chance of reaching their 100th birthday For this we have public health systems vaccination and antibiotics to thank It is by these means the prevention and treatment of illnesses caused by microorganisms that the real war against disease is principally won Elsewhere we have pushed the limits of survival notably in intensive care This the specialism in which I chose to train is where antibiotic resistant organisms are most prevalent Here powerful antibiotics essential in the treatment of lifethreatening illness are used routinely These drugs decimate ordinary bacteria But what they leave behind are hardy species that have begun to learn tricks that allow them to evade antibiotic drugs As a newly qualified doctor in the late 1990s I learnt about Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus the infamous MRSA a bacterial species resistant to methicillin and all other penicillins In the fight against it there were a handful of exoticsounding drugs vancomycin and teicoplanin among them These were supposed to be our last lines of defence but antibiotic resistant bacteria became more and more common as did species with new patterns of resistance Drugs we had previously barely heard of became commonplace New lastline drugs emerged to replace the old We got used to this state of affairs a steady escalation in the arms race between us and the bacteria But the balance has been shifting steadily In our hospitals and our GP surgeries we have abused the drugs that gave us such a huge advantage over infectious disease using them too often and too indiscriminately And some of the worst abuses have occurred outside of healthcare with antibiotics introduced into the food chain through agriculture and the lacing of livestock feed with antibacterial drugs We assumed that antibiotic therapy was an advantage we could enjoy forever We became complacent that the pharmaceutical industry would continue to stay ahead of the game But this is no longer the case New more resistant species have been identified The vancomycin that we used to rely on to treat MRSA infection was defeated Vancomycin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus VRSA emerged in our hospitals And other bacterial species were learning the same trick Enterobacteria organisms usually found in the gut had also acquired vancomycin resistance Today infections with formidable highly resistant organisms are commonplace and the pharmaceutical industry is not keeping pace Fewer and fewer new antimicrobial drugs are emerging from their production lines It is becoming increasingly difficult to develop new drugs active against resistant strains For every method of attack the pharmaceutical companies invent bacteria rapidly evolve a defence All of the simple approaches to the problem have been exhausted Antibiotics have become drugs that are expensive to develop that are only used in short courses and that quickly become ineffective due to the evolution of bacterial resistance Consequently the pharmaceutical industrys incentive to manufacture new drugs that can fight them is low Almost as soon as antibiotic use became widespread in the 1940s the first evidence of bacteria resistance to antimicrobial therapy emerged Initially these were little more than curiosities When they did infect patients the numbers were so small that at first they were not enough to warrant much attention But today they have become a fact of medical life Less than a century after the discovery of penicillin we are beginning to lose the fight Since the first MRSA deaths in otherwise healthy children in the US in 1998 the number of deaths from MRSA infection in the US each year has risen to tens of thousands outstripping the number of deaths caused by AIDS Bacterial resistance in hospitals is everywhere you look This is a war like no other There needs to be cultural change in our prescribing behaviours and more restraint in the use of antibiotics in farming and agriculture And somehow the pharmaceutical companies have to be convinced to chase the development of these less profitable drugs Within my working lifetime the pattern of antibiotic resistance in healthcare has transformed from a rare but notable event to a problem of epidemic proportion If we are to avoid a return to the preantibiotic time with all its excess mortality we must be bold To squander the advantage we have so recently gained against microorganisms in the fight for life would be unthinkable,test,ELE,ADV
114,Many of us know we dont get enough sleep but imagine if there was a simple solution getting up later In a speech at the British Science Festival Dr Paul Kelley from Oxford University said schools should stagger their starting times to work with the natural rhythms of their students This would improve exam results and students health lack of sleep can cause diabetes depression obesity and other health problems Dr Kelley said that when children are around ten their natural wakeup time is about 630am at 16 this rises to 8am and at 18 a persons natural waking hour is 9am although you may think they are just a lazy teenager The normal school starting time works for 10yearolds but not for 16 to 18yearolds For the older teenagers it might be better to start the school day at 11am or even later A 7am wakeup time for older teenagers says Kelley is the same as a 430am start for a teacher in their 50s He says the solution is not to tell teenagers to go to bed earlier The bodys natural rhythm is controlled by a particular kind of light says Kelley The eye has cells that report to a part of the brain that controls our sleep rhythms over a 24hour cycle Its the light that controls it But it isnt just students who would bene t from a later start Kelley says the working day should be more linked to our natural rhythms Describing the average sleep loss per night for different age groups he says Between 14 and 24 people lose more than two hours For people aged between 24 and about 30 or 35 they lose about an hour and a half That can continue up until youre about 55 when its in balance again The 10yearold and 55yearold wake and sleep naturally at the same time So should workplaces have staggered starting times too Should people in their 50s and above come in at 8am people in their 30s start at 10am and the teenage apprentice at 11am Kelley says that synchronized hours could have many positive effects The positive side is that peoples performance mood and health will improve Its very positive because its a solution that will make people less ill and happier and better at what they do There would probably be fewer accidents because drivers would be more awake he says It could mean the end of rush hour because people would stagger their work times and the times of their school run A later start to the day for many says Kelley is something that would bene t all people particularly families Parents go and try to wake up teenagers who are waking up three hours too early It creates problems for everybody So what time does Kelley start work I am 67 so that means Im like a 10yearold and I get up just after six I wake naturally And yes he says he nds the start of his working day much easier now than when he was younger,Lots of us know we are sleepdeprived but imagine if we could x it with a fairly simple solution getting up later In a speech at the British Science Festival Dr Paul Kelley clinical research associate at the Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute at Oxford University called for schools to stagger their starting times to work with the natural biological rhythms of their students It would improve cognitive performance exam results and students health sleep deprivation has been linked with diabetes depression obesity and an impaired immune system It follows a paper published in 2014 in which he noted that when children are around ten their biological wakeup time is about 630am at 16 this rises to 8am and at 18 someone you may think of as a lazy teenager actually has a natural waking hour of 9am The conventional school starting time works for 10yearolds but not 16 to 18yearolds For the older teenagers it might be more sensible to start the school day at 11am or even later A 7am alarm call for older adolescents Kelley and his colleagues pointed out in the paper is the equivalent of a 430am start for a teacher in their 50s He says its not as simple as persuading teenagers to go to bed earlier The bodys natural rhythm is controlled by a particular kind of light says Kelley The eye doesnt just contain rods and cones it contains cells that then report to the suprachiasmatic nuclei in the hypothalamus This part of the brain controls our circadian rhythms over a 24hour cycle Its the light that controls it Its like saying Why cant you control your heartbeat But it isnt just students who would bene t from a later start Kelley says the working day should be more forgiving of our natural rhythms Describing the average sleep loss per night for different age groups he says Between 14 and 24 its more than two hours For people aged between 24 and about 30 or 35 its about an hour and a half That can continue up until youre about 55 when its in balance again The 10yearold and 55yearold wake and sleep naturally at the same time This might be why he adds the traditional nine to ve is so ingrained it is maintained by bosses many of them in their mid50s and upwards because it is best for them So should workplaces have staggered starting times too Should those in their 50s and above come in at 8am while those in their 30s start at 10am and the teenage intern or apprentice be encouraged to turn up at 11am Kelley says that synchronized hours could have many positive consequences The positive side of this is peoples performance mood and health will improve Its very uplifting in a way because its a solution that will make people less ill and happier and better at what they do There would probably be fewer accidents as drivers would be more alert he says It could spell the end of rush hour as people stagger their work and schoolrun times A later start to the day for many says Kelley is something that would bene t everyone particularly families Parents go and try to wake up teenagers who are waking up three hours too early It creates tensions for everybody So what time does Kelley start work I am 67 so that means Im back to being ten years old and I get up just after six I wake naturally And yes he

49,The critics usually analyse the novels of wellknown British author David Mitchell in detail But he is not worried about the critics this time He completed his latest book at 1am one Tuesday morning before a car arrived to take him to the airport to catch a flight to Norway No one will see this novel until 2114 Mitchell is the second author to be part of the Future Library project For the project they planted 1000 trees in 2014 in Oslos Nordmarka forest The first author Margaret Atwood gave the manuscript of a text called Scribbler Moon to the project in 2015 Each year for the next hundred years an author will write a novel that people will only read in 2114 when the trees are cut down to make paper to make the books Each author will travel to the place in the forest high above Oslo where they will give their manuscripts to the project in a short ceremony Its a little bit of hope at a time when there is lots of very depressing news It shows that we have a chance of civilization in a hundred years said Mitchell Everything is telling us that were doomed but the Future Library brings hope that we are stronger than we think that we will be here that there will be trees that there will be books and readers and civilization Mitchell said that writing this book made him feel free because I wont be around to know if people think its good or bad But before me was Margaret Atwood and next year Im sure there will be another brilliant writer So my book had better be good I would look such a fool if they opened my book in 2114 and it wasnt any good Mitchell says that he usually polishes and polishes his writing I polish too much But this was very different I wrote till the final minute So the first twothirds are polished and the final third I didnt have time And I felt free The creator of the Future Library asked writers to write on the theme of imagination and time Mitchell revealed only the name of the manuscript From Me Flows What You Call Time during a ceremony in the Norwegian woods next to where the 1000 trees are planted The title comes from a piece of music by Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu Mitchell only told us that his book is longer than I thought it would be He said nothing more In the forest Mitchell read a short story and a poem This small section of forest will be carefully managed for the next 98 years before it becomes Future Librarys manuscripts How vain to think my writing will be of interest to future generations But it is the opposite of vain to work hard on a manuscript that nobody will ever congratulate you for and say Good job or I loved the bit where she did that and he did this Mitchell wrote They will seal his manuscript and put it next to Atwoods manuscript in a room in Oslos new public library which will open in 2019 The manuscript is now says the author gone from me like a coin Ive dropped in a river,David Mitchell a regular contender for the Man Booker literary prize is used to his novels being picked over by the critics So its something of a relief says the British author that his latest work completed at 1am one Tuesday morning before a car arrived to take him to the airport to catch a flight to Norway wont be seen by anyone until 2114 Mitchell is the second contributor to the Scottish artist Katie Patersons Future Library project for which 1000 trees were planted in 2014 in Oslos Nordmarka forest Starting with Margaret Atwood who handed over the manuscript of a text called Scribbler Moon in 2015 each year for the next 100 years an author will deliver a piece of writing that will only be read in 2114 when the trees are chopped down to make paper on which the 100 texts will be printed Each author their names revealed year by year and chosen by a panel of experts and Paterson while she is alive will make the trek to the spot in the forest high above Oslo where they will surrender their manuscripts in a short ceremony Its a little glimmer of hope in a season of highly depressing news cycles which affirms we are in with a chance of civilization in a hundred years said Mitchell Everything is telling us that were doomed but the Future Library is a candidate on the ballot paper for possible futures It brings hope that we are more resilient than we think that we will be here that there will be trees that there will be books and readers and civilization Mitchell said he found writing the book quite liberating because I wont be around to take the consequences of this being good or bad But Im sandwiched between Margaret Atwood and no doubt some other brilliant writer So it better be good What a historic fool of epochal proportions Id look if they opened it in 2114 and it wasnt any good Usually says Mitchell who was shortlisted for the Man Booker for his novels number9dream and Cloud Atlas he polishes and polishes his writing Actually I overpolish But this was very different I wrote up to the wire So the first twothirds were polished and the final third I didnt have time And it was a liberation Future Library creator Paterson whose past works have involved her mapping dead stars and compiling a slide archive of the history of darkness through the ages asked the writers to tackle the theme of imagination and time which they can take in so many directions Mitchell revealed only the name of the manuscript From Me Flows What You Call Time during a ceremony in the Norwegian woods next to where Patersons 1000 trees are planted The title is taken from a piece of music by Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu but other than admitting that its somewhat more substantial a thing than I was expecting the author would say nothing Handing over his text in the forest sheltered from the intermittent rain by an umbrella and amid the foothigh shoots of 1000 pine trees Mitchell read his damp audience of children and adults a short story and William Wordsworths A slumber did my spirit seal Its ending Rolled round in earths diurnal course With rocks and stones and trees felt appropriate in this small section of forest carpeted with blueberry bushes which will be carefully tended to for the next 98 years before it is turned into Future Librarys manuscripts How vain to suppose the scribblings of little old me will be of enduring interest to future generations Yet how lowkey and understated to slave over a manuscript that nobody will ever pat you on the back for and say Nice one or God I loved the bit where she did that and he did this Mitchell wrote in a piece for the Future Library His manuscript now delivered will be sealed and placed alongside Atwoods in a woodlined room in Oslos new public library which will open in 2019 Watched over by a trust of experts until it is finally printed it is now says the novelist as gone from

authorities asking how we do it The thought of children across the country running every day because of something weve done is amazing One in ten children are obese when they start school at the age of four or ve say the Health Social Care Information Centre And in the summer of 2015 a study found that schoolchildren in England are more un t than they have ever been For this reason primary schools can see the bene ts of the daily mile It has been introduced in schools in various parts of the UK and other schools are planning to introduce it soon Just in Stirling 30 schools have already started or are going to start the daily mile Running is a good way to improve childrens tness and its free and easy The most important thing is that the children really enjoy it If they didnt enjoy it you couldnt continue with it They come back inside with bright eyes and rosy cheeks Its how children used to look said Wyllie At St Ninians teachers take their pupils out of lessons to the schools playing eld for their daily mile at a time that suits that days timetable Only ice or very heavy rain stop them Researchers from Stirling University have begun a study to look for evidence of the physical cognitive and emotional bene ts of the daily mile Dr Colin Moran who is leading the study said The children dont seem to have problems with obesity they seem happier and teachers say they learn better So we designed a study that tests all of these things They will compare St Ninians pupils with children from another school in Stirling where children havent started running yet Kevin Clelland a primary school teacher from Leeds visited St Ninians Then he convinced the other teachers in his school that it was a great idea He said Its such a simple thing to do but seems to have such an amazing impact We really want to improve the tness of our pupils His school is now building a running track Paralympian Tanni GreyThompson chair of ukactive a health organization for physical activity said All children need to achieve 60 active minutes every day this can be in a lesson on the walk to school or in the playground Its fantastic to see ideas like the daily mile It shows that schools want to improve childrens tness and their cognitive behaviour and make a real difference to schools teachers parents and young peoples lives We know sitting still kills not sitting still helps children build skills that will help them for the rest of their lives The Scottish government also supports the idea A spokesperson said Learning in PE is improved by ideas like the daily mile which can help parents keep their children healthy We are pleased to see that so many Scottish schools are taking part or want to,As soon as the children at one primary school in Stirling hear the words daily mile they down their pencils and head out of the classroom to start running laps around the school eld For threeandahalf years all pupils at St Ninians Primary have walked or run a mile each day They do so at random times during the day apparently happily and despite the rise in childhood obesity across the UK none of the children at the school are overweight The daily mile has done so much to improve these childrens tness behaviour and concentration in lessons that scores of nursery and primary schools across Britain are following suit and getting pupils to get up from their desks and take 15 minutes to walk or run round the school or local park Elaine Wyllie headteacher of St Ninians said I get at least two emails a day from other schools and local authorities asking how we do it

gures from the Health Social Care Information Centre and in the summer of 2015 a study found that schoolchildren in England are the least t they have ever been Primary schools have therefore been quick to note the bene ts of the daily mile It has been introduced in schools in London Gateshead Wales and other parts of Scotland while others are planning to launch the initiative during the 20156 academic year In Stirling alone 30 schools have already started or are to start the daily mile Its a commonsense approach to childrens tness which is free and easy The most important thing is that the children really enjoy it otherwise you couldnt sustain it They come back in brighteyed and rosycheeked how children used to look Its joyous to see said Wyllie At St Ninians teachers take their pupils out of lessons on to a specially built circuit around the schools playing eld for their daily mile whenever it best suits that days timetable Only ice or very heavy rain stop them The extent of the bene ts have yet to be determined but researchers from Stirling University have launched a comparative study to look for quantitative evidence of the physical cognitive and emotional bene ts of the daily mile Dr Colin Moran who is leading the study said The children at St Ninians dont seem to have problems with obesity they seem happier and staff say they settle into lessons faster so we designed a study that would test all of these things There is a lot of anecdotal evidence about the bene ts but there arent any scienti c facts yet St Ninians pupils will be compared with children from another school in Stirling that has yet to start the scheme Kevin Clelland a primary school teacher from Leeds visited St Ninians before convincing his colleagues it was a great idea He said Its

could see a huge vapour trail in the morning sky and hear car alarms from the street below I didnt understand what was going on said Zaglumyonova There was a big explosion and then lots of little explosions My first thought was that it was a plane crash In fact it was a tentonne meteorite that fell to Earth in lots of pieces Almost 1200 people were injured More than 40 people were taken to hospital most of them were hurt by flying glass There were no deaths The meteorite entered the atmosphere at a speed of at least 33000 miles per hour and broke into pieces between 18 and 32 miles above the ground The event caused panic in Chelyabinsk a city of more than one million people to the south of Russias Ural mountains People could see the vapour trail for hundreds of miles even from neighbouring Kazakhstan Tatyana Bets was at work in the reception area of a hospital clinic in the centre of the city when the meteorite hit First we noticed the wind and then the room was filled with a very bright light and we could see smoke in the sky she said Then after a few minutes the explosions came At least three craters were found One crater was more than six metres wide Another piece of meteorite broke through the thick ice of a lake In Chelyabinsk schools and universities were closed and people were told to go home early About 200 children were injured Many people mostly with cuts from flying glass came into the clinic where Bets works She said many of the students at a nearby college came to the hospital There were a lot of girls in shock she said More than 100000 square metres of glass were broken and 3000 buildings were hit The total cost of the damage in the city is probably more than one billion roubles 20 million The meteorite arrived a day before asteroid 2012 DA14 passed Earth very closely about 17510 miles But experts said the two events were not connected There were lots of rumours in the first few hours after the incident Reports on Russian state television and in local media suggested that the Russian military blew apart the meteorite The ultranationalist leader of Russias Liberal Democrat party Vladimir Zhirinovsky said it was not a meteorite He said it was a weapons test by the United States Some people were selling pieces of meteorite through internet sites within a few hours of the impact Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said that it shows us that the whole planet is vulnerable,Galina Zaglumyonova was woken in her flat in central Chelyabinsk by an enormous explosion that blew in the balcony windows and shattered clay pots containing her few houseplants When she jumped out of bed she could see a huge vapour trail hanging in the morning sky and hear the wail of car alarms from the street below I didnt understand what was going on said Zaglumyonova There was a big explosion and then a series of little explosions My first thought was that it was a plane crash What she had actually witnessed were the death throes of a tentonne meteorite that plunged to Earth in a series of fireballs just after sunrise Officials put the number of people injured at almost 1200 with more than 40 taken to hospital most as a result of flying glass shattered by the sonic boom created by the meteorites descent There were no reported deaths The meteorite entered the atmosphere travelling at a speed of at least 33000mph and broke up into chunks between 18 and 32 miles above the ground according to a statement from the Russian Academy of Sciences The event caused panic in Chelyabinsk a city of more than one million people to the south of Russias Ural mountains as mobile phone networks swiftly became jammed by the volume of calls Amateur video footage from the area often peppered with the obscene language of frightened observers showed the chunks of meteorite glowing more brightly as they approached the moment of impact The vapour trail was visible for hundreds of miles around including in neighbouring Kazakhstan Tatyana Bets was at work in the reception area of a hospital clinic in the centre of the city when the meteorite struck First we noticed the wind and then the room was filled with a very bright light and we could see a cloud of some unspecified smoke in the sky she said Then after a few minutes came the explosions At least three craters were subsequently discovered according to the Ministry of the Interior and were being monitored by the military One crater was more than six metres wide while another lump of meteorite was reported to have slammed through the thick ice of a nearby lake Radiation levels at the impact sites were normal according to local military officials In Chelyabinsk itself schools and universities were closed and many other staff told to go home early About 200 children were among the injured A steady stream of lightly injured people most suffering cuts from flying glass came into the clinic where Bets works She said a nearby dormitory building for college students was particularly badly affected and many of the students were brought in suffering from fright There were a lot of girls in shock Some were very pale and many of them fainted she said Early estimates suggested more than 100000 square metres of glass had been broken and 3000 buildings hit The total cost of the damage in the city was being valued at in excess of one billion roubles 20m The meteorite over Chelyabinsk arrived less than a day before asteroid 2012 DA14 was expected to make the closest pass to Earth about 17510 miles of any recorded cosmic body But experts said the two events were linked by nothing more than coincidence Rumours and conspiracy theories however swirled in the first few hours after the incident Reports on Russian state television and in local media suggested that the meteorite was engaged by local air defence units and blown apart at an altitude of more than 15 miles The ultranationalist leader of Russias Liberal Democrat party Vladimir Zhirinovsky said it was not a meteorite but military action by the United States echoing much of the speculation voiced on amateur film footage Its not a meteorite falling its a test of new American weapons Zhirinovsky said Some were quick to take advantage of the confusion Enterprising people were offering lumps of meteorite for sale through internet sites within a few hours of the impact President Vladimir Putin and the Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev were informed about the incident and Putin convened a meeting with the head of the Emergency Situations Ministry Its proof that not only are economies vulnerable but the whole planet Medvedev said at an economic forum in Siberia Dmitry Rogozin Russias Deputy Prime Minister and former Ambassador to NATO took to Twitter to call for an international push to create a

painters sculptors fashion designers photographers filmmakers and actors Thirty thousand members of the public suggested the people on the list The list included Alfred Hitchcock Alexander McQueen Derek Jarman Laura Ashley William Morris and Vanessa Bell The final five Barbara Hepworth Charlie Chaplin Josiah Wedgwood William Hogarth and Turner were chosen because of their importance to the visual arts and British society and because of their influence They made the announcement about the new banknote at the Turner Contemporary gallery in Margate Carney and the artist Tracey Emin who grew up in the town made the announcement together Carney said that banknotes are not just practical they can be a piece of art in everyones pocket The note will show Turners 1799 selfportrait and also one of Turners most famous paintings The Fighting Temeraire a painting of a ship that had an important role in Nelsons victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 The note will also inlude a quote

Turner was born in 1775 in London the son of a barber and he went to the Royal Academy Schools at the age of 14 In 1786 he went to Margate and there his love of painting and drawing the northeast Kent coast began He returned to the Kent coast many times in his life and it was where he painted some of his most dramatic paintings He said that on the Kent coast the skies were the loveliest in all Europe Turner painted more than 550 oil paintings and 2000 watercolours in his lifetime A film about Turner was made in 2014 with Timothy Spall as the artist Victoria Pomery the director of Turner

Turner renowned for his dramatic seascapes beat off competition from 590 painters sculptors fashion designers photographers filmmakers and actors put forward by 30000 members of the public The list included Alfred Hitchcock Alexander McQueen Derek Jarman Laura Ashley William Morris and Vanessa Bell which was then narrowed down by a panel of artists critics and historians to a final choice of five The final five Barbara Hepworth Charlie Chaplin Josiah Wedgwood William Hogarth and Turner were selected on the basis of their unquestioned contribution to both the visual arts and British society as a whole as well as their enduring influence Fittingly the announcement of the new banknote was made at the Turner Contemporary gallery in Margate which stands on the former site of Mrs Booths lodging house where Turner would always stay when he visited The announcement was made jointly by Carney and the artist Tracey Emin who grew up in the town Carney said it had been so important to get this right and have a proper process that involved the public adding that far from banknotes being purely a practical necessity if done properly they can be a piece of art in everyones pocket Money is memory for a country and its people said the Bank of England governor Banknotes of the Bank of England are a celebration of the UKs heritage a salute to its culture a testament to its great achievements including those of its most notable citizens In short money has not just economic value it has cultural value as well The fact that we will have Turner on the 20 note shows now that the British people are a nation of people who appreciate creativity and appreciate the arts said Emin The note will feature Turners 1799 selfportrait which currently hangs in Tate Britain as well as one of his most recognizable works The Fighting Temeraire a tribute to the ship that played a distinguished role in Nelsons victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 Emblazoned on the note will also be a

figures were first introduced onto banknotes in 1970 Turner joins Winston Churchill and Jane Austen as the significant figures who will feature on the new polymer notes a plastictype material that the new notes will all be made from Churchill on the 5 and Austen on the 10 note Following in the footsteps of Florence Nightingale and Elizabeth Fry the Pride and Prejudice author is only the third woman to be the face of British currency Turner was born in 1775 in London the son of a barber and he entered the Royal Academy Schools at the age of 14 It was 1786 when he was sent to Margate that his love affair with painting and drawing the northeast Kent coast began He would return to that coast throughout his life and it was where he painted some of his most dramatic oils and watercolours describing its skies as the loveliest in all Europe Turner was a particularly prolific artist producing more than 550 oil paintings and 2000 watercolours over his lifetime His life was also the subject of a film in 2014 by Mike Leigh with Timothy Spall taking on the role of the complex artist Victoria Pomery the director of Turner Contemporary said The decision to celebrate JMW Turner one of the greatest technical pioneers in the history of British art is extraordinary not least because it has proven by a public vote that Turner is the nations favourite artist Brilliantly it is an official acknowledgment of the immense historical value of the visual arts to the UK But it is also a stark reminder that we must place increasing value on our future as a nation of creative minds We must

because PizzaExpress keeps as an admin fee 8p out of every 1 paid when tips are given by card The chain which has 430 restaurants in the UK earns around 1 million a year from this practice according to the union Unite We believe this 8 fee is unfair If the chain values its staff it should pay them the total tips from customers said Chantal Chegrinec of Unite We are starting with PizzaExpress but they are not the only company who do this And we will target other companies after this The rst protest will take place at a PizzaExpress restaurant at the British Museum in London Unite did a survey of PizzaExpress staff after a Chinese company bought the chain in 2014 Lots of the staff complained about the 8 deduction from their tips so thats why Unite began the campaign One angry PizzaExpress employee who does not want to give her name said that the admin fee cost her 3 a night I have worked at PizzaExpress for 15 years she said in a letter to Unite After all this time Im still only paid the national minimum wage of 650 an hour So you see my colleagues and I need customer tips to increase our low wages I work hard and am good at my job but when PizzaExpress thinks it can take a percentage of our tips I get upset Restaurant chains Ask and Zizzi also deduct 8 of the tips paid by card But other chains deduct even more Cafe Rouge Bella Italia and Belgo deduct 10 Strada and Giraffe do too A spokesperson for PizzaExpress said that the money they take from tips pays for a system that they use to share the tips among staff Staff use this system to decide how to share tips made by card she said The chain sells 29 million pizzas a year in its UK restaurants It says it does not make a pro t from the admin fee But other restaurant groups do not deduct an admin fee from

deduct even more Cafe Rouge Bella Italia and Belgo deduct 10 as do Strada and Giraffe which is owned by Tesco A spokesperson for PizzaExpress said that its admin charge was to cover the cost of

11,A menu scandal at some of Japans top hotels and department stores is damaging the international reputation of Japanese food One luxury hotel group admitted that it lied about ingredients on its menus Since then there have been similar stories from restaurants run by famous hotels and department stores in Japan The story began when the HankyuHanshin hotel group admitted that it gave false descriptions of menu items at some of its restaurants between 2006 and October 2013 For example the red salmon caviar that customers ordered was in fact the eggs of the flying fish The hotel groups president Hiroshi Desaki went on television to announce a 20 pay cut for himself and 10 for other executives But this did not make customers less angry Days later Desaki resigned he said that the hotel group had betrayed their customers So far the company has refunded 20 million yen to more than 10000 consumers In total they will refund 110 million yen Customers who believed they ate expensive kuruma shrimps were told they in fact ate much cheaper black tiger shrimps complained in a blogpost that a scallop dish he ordered at the Prince Hotel in Tokyo contained a similar but cheaper type of shellfish The hotel investigated the complaint and as a result corrected more than 50 menu items at dozens of its restaurants Its report scared HankyuHanshin and other hoteliers into admitting that they too lied to customers who believed they were paying high prices for top ingredients The Hotel Okura group where Barack Obama has stayed said they also injected beef with fat to make it juicier and incorrectly described tomatoes as organic We apologize for lying to our clients it said The list of fraudulent ingredients gets bigger orange juice from cartons that was sold as freshly squeezed Mont Blanc desserts with Korean chestnuts instead of the French ones on the menu shopbought chocolate cream that the menu said was homemade imported beef sold as expensive wagyu beef The menu scandal has come at the wrong time Japan is trying to persuade South Korea and other countries to start to buy Japanese food again after the Fukushima nuclear accident Food industry experts said the global financial crisis in 2008 forced luxury hotels to save money Menu descriptions were created to sound good to the customers and when hotels couldnt get the ingredients on the menu they just used food from different places Hiroshi Tomozawa a hotel and restaurant consultant told Kyodo News,It began with a bogus scallop but a menu scandal that has engulfed some of Japans most prestigious hotels and department stores now threatens to undermine the international reputation of the countrys vaunted cuisine Since one luxury hotel chain admitted lying about the provenance of ingredients on its menus Japanese media have served up almost daily revelations of similar transgressions by restaurants run by wellknown hotels and department stores The frenzy began when the HankyuHanshin hotel chain based in Osaka admitted it had given false descriptions of dozens of menu items at some of its restaurants between 2006 and October 2013 affecting an estimated 78000 diners Among the chief menu misdemeanours was a red salmon caviar dish that turned out to be the less sumptuous eggs of the flying fish A televised attempt by the hotel groups president Hiroshi Desaki to limit the damage by announcing a 20 pay cut for himself and 10 for other executives failed to mollify angry consumers Days later Desaki resigned conceding that the hotel group had betrayed our customers although he added We never had the intention to deceive them One of the hotels head chefs later declined a medal of honour he was due to receive from the government The company has so far refunded more than 10000 consumers to the tune of 20m yen the eventual bill is expected to reach 110m yen Japans version of the UK horsemeat scandal has since spread to several household names in catering While as in the UK no one has fallen ill from eating mislabelled produce the outbreak of anger shows no sign of abating Consumers who believed they had eaten prized kuruma shrimps for example were told they had in fact dined on the much cheaper black tiger version The first incident went almost unnoticed The Prince Hotel in Tokyo was forced to come clean after a diner complained in a blogpost that a scallop dish he had ordered contained a similar but cheaper type of shellfish The hotel launched an investigation and went on to correct more than 50 menu items at dozens of its restaurants Its report scared HankyuHanshin and other hoteliers into admitting that they too had hoodwinked diners who believed they were paying high prices for premium ingredients The Hotel Okura chain whose guests have included Barack Obama confessed myriad sins including injecting beef with fat to make it juicier and incorrectly describing tomatoes as organic We deeply apologize for betraying the expectations and confidence of our clients it said in a statement The list of fraudulent ingredients continues to grow orange juice from cartons sold as freshly squeezed Mont Blanc desserts topped with Korean chestnuts instead

These incidents have surfaced one after the other and this inappropriate labelling has resulted in the loss of trust among consumers he told reporters These are clearly coverups The fraudulent menu scandal has exploded at just the wrong time Japan is trying to persuade South Korea and other countries to lift bans on food imports imposed in response to the Fukushima nuclear accident while UNESCO is considering a request to add Japanese cuisine to its intangible cultural heritage list One local newspaper ran the headline Japans proud food culture in tears while the mass circulation Yomiuri Shimbun said it was astonished by the industrys lack of morals The newspaper voiced concerns that the scandal could harm the credibility of brand Japan products and services which are praised by foreign countries and tourists for their safety and security Industry experts said the global financial crisis in 2008 had forced luxury hotels to cut costs while attempting to woo diners with detailed menu descriptions Menu descriptions were created to meet consumers preference for brand products and when they couldnt obtain the ingredients stated on the menu hotels just used food from different places of origin Hiroshi Tomozawa a hotel and restaurant consultant told Kyodo News While they count the cost to their reputations the hotels and restaurants involved are unlikely to face legal action Menus are not covered by the agricultural standards law or by a new food labelling law due to go into effect in 2015 The authorities only legal weapon is a law banning misleading

125,A new computerassisted autopsy system is becoming more and more popular in European hospitals Its inventor says that the system could mean that now there will be no such thing as a perfect murder The method called Virtopsy is being used at some forensic medical institutes in Europe It was invented by a group of scientists at the University of Zurich Instead of cutting the chest like in a traditional autopsy pathologists are now able to examine the dead body in 3D via computer screens Michael Thali the Director of Zurichs Institute for Forensic Medicine in Europe and one of the inventors of Virtopsy said it could completely change criminal investigations Basically there will be no such thing as the perfect murder any more because a virtual autopsy allows you to find every piece of evidence he said Virtopsies use powerful machines Together the machines are called a Virtobot Virtopsies can find injuries that are not seen during a traditional autopsy as well as air pockets heart attacks and even cancer The Virtopsy could replace the autopsy one day said Richard Dirndorfer one of the first people to use DNA analysis in criminology I think well see it happen slowly just like DNA analysis slowly replaced blood group analysis The method allows doctors to see deep inside dead bodies It can see things that cannot be found during traditional autopsies Criminologists from around the world have been travelling to Switzerland over the past few years to see the new method Forensic scientists and pathologists think the method can be used together with the traditional autopsy In order to analyze the colour of the blood the thickness of body fluids or smells well need to use traditional autopsy methods said Lars Oesterhelweg Deputy Director of the Institute of Forensic Medicine at the Charit Hospital in Berlin which is using a version of the Virtopsy He added that the new method was very helpful in reexamining cases where the cause of death was unclear It means that investigations can be reexamined and we can try again to find the murderer he said Scientists said that relatives of the dead prefer the Virtopsy method because during a traditional autopsy scientists have to cut and damage the dead body,The inventor of a stateoftheart computerassisted autopsy system that is increasingly being used in European hospitals has claimed the technique could eventually mean there is no such thing as a perfect murder The method called Virtopsy is now being used at selected forensic medical institutes in Europe having been pioneered by a group of scientists at the University of Zurich Instead of reaching for the scalpel and making the Yshaped incision in the chest with which a traditional autopsy begins pathologists are now able to examine the corpse in 3D via computer screens Michael Thali the Director of Zurichs Institute for Forensic Medicine in Europe and one of the inventors of Virtopsy said it had the potential to revolutionize criminal investigations Basically there will be no such thing as the perfect murder any more as a virtual autopsy allows you to find every piece of evidence he said Virtopsies combine the images from highpowered magnetic resonance imaging MRI computed tomography CT and surface scans of dead bodies Combined the devices are referred to as a Virtobot The technique allows the detection of injuries such as lesions and blows often undetectable during a traditional autopsy as well as air pockets heart attacks and even cancer The Virtopsy has the potential to replace the autopsy one day Richard Dirndorfer one of the pioneers of DNA analysis in criminology and a founder developer of Virtopsy told the German science magazine PM I think well see it happen gradually just like DNA analysis gradually replaced blood group analysis he said The computer imaging techniques allow doctors to gain indepth insights into the deepest interiors of dead bodies The method has already allowed the discovery of haemorrhages and fractures that were not picked up during conventional autopsies The initial aim is to use the new method to complement the traditional autopsy It will enable forensic scientists to plan their autopsies far more efficiently Dominic Wichmann an internal medicine specialist at Hamburgs University Hospital told Spiegel Criminologists from around the world have been travelling to Switzerland over the past few years to see the development of the new method for themselves The US forensic medical drama CSI has already twice featured Virtopsies In one the system was able to prove that a murder victim was killed by a bullet through the cheek in another a Virtopsy on a murdered man meant his wish to be cryogenically frozen could still go ahead as his body remained intact The method has been under development for decades with the scientists behind it first housed in an unheated laboratory on a university campus where they were considered a bit of a laughing stock Later a donation from a rich ophthalmologist enabled the project to take off Even then it was initially rejected for its potential to undermine the traditional skills of forensic scientists and pathologists But a new generation appears to be seeing it as less of a threat and rather as something that will complement and substantiate conventional methods and possibly even one day replace them though probably not entirely In order to analyze the colour of the blood the consistencies of body fluids or smells well need to keep on with the conventional cut said Lars Oesterhelweg Deputy Director of the Institute of Forensic Medicine at the Charit Hospital in Berlin which is using a version of the Virtopsy He added that the new method was particularly helpful in reexamining cases where the cause of death was unclear It means that third opinions can be gathered investigations can be reexamined and cases can be reopened he said Scientists using the new method said that relatives of the dead who are often reluctant for autopsies to be carried out because of the disfigurement they cause were much keener on the noninvasive method,test,ELE,ADV
146,Illegal downloading is morally wrong and it is theft the same as putting your hand in someones pocket and stealing their wallet is theft says author Philip Pullman In an article for magazine Index on Censorship Pullman who is president of the Society of Authors strongly defends copyright laws He criticizes internet users who think it is OK to download music or books without paying for them The technology is so dazzling that people cant see that what theyre doing is wrong he writes It is outrageous that anyone can steal an artists work without punishment It is theft just as putting your hand in someones pocket and taking their wallet is theft His article comes after music industry leaders met British Prime Minister David Cameron in Downing Street to discuss the issue of web piracy Pullman writer of the His Dark Materials trilogy says authors and musicians work in poverty for years to bring their work to the level that gives happiness to their audiences and when they achieve that the possibility of making money from it is taken away from them He concludes If we want to enjoy the work that someone does we should pay for it Pullman is writing in the next issue of the campaign groups

the door on the many ways that people can share build upon and remix each others work possibilities that we could not imagine when those laws were made She says artists need to think creatively about how they earn money from their work Index on Censorship agrees The magazines editor Rachael Jolley said Existing copyright laws dont work in the digital age and they criminalize consumers We need new ideas for how artists writers and musicians can earn a living from their work Illegal downloading is a very big problem Between November 2012 and January 2013 in the UK 280 million music tracks were digitally pirated along with 52 million TV shows 29 million films18 million ebooks and 7 million software or games files 18 of internet users aged over 12 say they have pirated items and 9 say they are afraid they will get caught Pullman writes in his article The ease and speed with which people can get music in MP3 is still very surprising to people like me who have been building up their iTunes list for some time After the Downing Street meeting Cameron asked the Conservative MP Mike Weatherley to be his adviser on the subject The BPI an organization that supports music companies said Mike Weatherley is a strong supporter of copyright and the artists and creative producers its there to protect We hope his influence and the prime ministers support for copyright will change how we

or books without paying for them The technical brilliance is so dazzling that people cant see the moral squalor of what theyre doing he writes It is outrageous that anyone can steal an artists work and get away with it It is theft as surely as reaching into someones pocket and taking their wallet is theft His article comes after music industry leaders met British Prime Minister David Cameron in Downing Street where the issue of web piracy was discussed Pullman writer of the His Dark Materials trilogy says authors and musicians work in poverty and obscurity for years to bring their work to the level that gives delight to their audiences and as soon as they achieve that the possibility of making a living from it is taken away from them He concludes The principle is simple and unaltered by technology science or magic if we want to enjoy the work that someone does we should pay for it Pullman is writing in the next issue of the campaign groups magazine in a dialogue with Cathy Casserly chief executive of Creative Commons which offers open content licences that lets creators take copyright into their own hands Casserly argues that there is much wrong with copyright which was created in an analogue age She writes By default copyright closes the door on countless ways that people can share build upon and remix each others work possibilities that were unimaginable when those laws were established She says artists need to think creatively about how they distribute and monetize their work quoting the science fiction writer Cory Doctorow who said My problem is not piracy its obscurity Index on Censorship agrees The magazines editor Rachael Jolley said Existing copyright laws dont work in the digital age and risk criminalizing consumers We need new models for how artists writers and musicians earn a living from their work The debate is a lively one and the scale of illegal downloading vast Data collected by Ofcom the independent regulator and competition authority for

98,Cities dont often move But thats exactly what Kiruna an Arctic town in northern Sweden has to do It has to move or the earth will swallow it up Its a terrible choice says Krister Lindstedt who works for the Swedish architect company that is moving the city They will move this city of 23000 people away from a gigantic ironore mine that is swallowing up the ground beneath its streets Either the mine must stop digging and then there will be no jobs or the city has to move Kiruna was founded in 1900 by the stateowned LuossavaaraKiirunavaara mining company LK The city became rich thanks to the very large amount of iron ore that is below the town But the mine that made it rich is now going to destroy it The town is here because of the mine says Deputy Mayor Niklas Siren Located 145km inside the Arctic Circle Kiruna has a very difficult climate It has winters with no sunlight and average temperatures of 15C But the iron ore has kept people here Kiruna is the worlds largest underground ironore mine It produces 90 of all the iron in Europe That is enough to build more than six Eiffel Towers every day In 2004 the mining company told the town that it would have to move Underground digging would soon cause buildings to crack and collapse Ten years later cracks are starting to appear in the ground nearer and nearer to the town The people of Kiruna have waited for ten years says Viktoria Walldin a social anthropologist who works with the architects They have put their lives on hold unable to make major decisions like buying a house redecorating having a child or opening a business At last the city finally has a plan Lindstedt has a plan that shows the towns streets and squares beginning to move east along a new high street By 2033 the whole city will be far away from the mine They are already building a new town square 3km to the east with a circular town hall planned by Danish architect Henning Larsen They will take apart and put together again 20 other important buildings in their new home Kirunas red wooden church was built in 1912 and once voted Swedens most beautiful building it will be in the centre of a new park But they will not save everything I spoke to an old lady who walks past the bench every day where she had her first kiss says Walldin Its things like that the hospital where your first child was born for example that are important to people and all thats going to disappear The project will get 320 million from the mining company to build new buildings including a high school fire station community centre library and swimming hall But most people worry about where they will live and how they will get a house or flat People here pay very low rents and have very high incomes but in future this will change says Lindstedt LK has agreed to pay the people of Kiruna the value of their homes plus 25 but many people say this is not enough to buy a new house If you look more closely the plan shows that the new town does not look like the old Kiruna at all The old town has detached houses with gardens The White architects plan shows multistorey apartment blocks around shared courtyards in long straight streets It is an opportunity say the architects for Kiruna to become a town that will attract young people There will be new cultural places and wonderful things such as a cable car above the high street But many of the people in Kiruna will probably not have,Cities dont often decide to pack their bags get up and move down the road But thats exactly what Kiruna an Arctic town in northern Sweden is having to do to avoid being swallowed up into the earth Its a dystopian choice says Krister Lindstedt of White the Stockholmbased architects firm charged with the biblical task of moving this city of 23000 people away from a gigantic ironore mine that is fast gobbling up the ground beneath its streets Either the mine must stop digging creating mass unemployment or the city has to move or else face certain destruction Its an existential predicament Founded in 1900 by the stateowned LuossavaaraKiirunavaara mining company LK Kiruna has grown rich off the vast seam of iron ore below the town but its now facing destruction by the very phenomenon that created its wealth We are symbiotic the town is here because of the mine says Deputy Mayor Niklas Siren Otherwise no devil would have built a city here Located 145km inside the Arctic Circle Kiruna is subject to a brutal climate enduring winters with no sunlight and average temperatures below 15C But the deep deposit of magnetite has proved a strong enough magnet to keep people here Driven by the insatiable global appetite for construction the mine has become the worlds largest underground ironore extraction site producing 90 of all the iron in Europe enough to build more than six Eiffel Towers a day And demand continues to grow In 2004 the mining company broke it to the town that its days were numbered digging its shafts towards the city at an angle of 60 degrees subsidence would soon lead to the widespread cracking and collapse of the towns buildings A decade on fissures are starting to appear in the ground creeping ever closer to the town The people of Kiruna have been living in limbo for ten years says Viktoria Walldin a social anthropologist who works with the architects They have put their lives on hold unable to make major decisions like buying a house redecorating having a child or opening a business After years of dithering the city has finally unveiled a master plan for how it will proceed Imagine it like a walking millipede of a city says Lindstedt unrolling a plan that shows the towns streets and squares beginning to crawl eastwards along a new high street until the whole place has moved safely out of the way of the mine by 2033 A new town square is already under way 3km to the east with a circular town hall planned by Danish architect Henning Larsen while 20 key buildings have been identified to be dismantled and resurrected piece by piece in their new home like an Ikea flatpack on a grand scale Kirunas rustred wooden church built in 1912 in a form that recalls the indigenous Sami teepees and once voted Swedens most beautiful building will take pride of place in a new park while the castiron bell tower will stand once again above the town hall But not everything will be saved I spoke to an old lady who walks past the bench every day where she had her first kiss says Walldin Its things like that the hospital where your first child was born for example that are important to peoples sense of identity and all thats going to disappear Billed as the most democratic move in history the project has been allocated the equivalent of 320m by the mining company for building new facilities including a high school fire station community centre library and swimming hall But top of most peoples concerns is where they will actually live and what process will determine the housing allocation These details have yet to be determined admits Lindstedt People are used to very low rents and very high incomes but in future this will have to change LK has agreed to compensate residents to the value of their homes plus 25 but many locals say this is not enough to afford a newbuild house at market rates To aid the valuation process the architects have monitored the housing lettings in nearby cities over a period of years and tagged the homes in Kiruna with the assets they possess from internal space and gardens to proximity to bus stops and the city centre They have also proposed a Kiruna Portal a kind of mass salvage yard where materials from the doomed homes can be brought and hopefully recycled in the construction of the new buildings although given that Sweden has no tradition of selfbuild its hard to see this taking off A closer look at the plan shows the new town bears little relation to the original Kiruna at all The current town is a sprawling suburban network of winding streets home to detached houses with gardens Whites plan incorporates a much higherdensity arrangement of multistorey apartment blocks around shared courtyards lining straight boulevards down which the icy winds will surge It is an opportunity say the architects for Kiruna to reinvent itself into a model of sustainable development attracting young people who wouldnt have stayed in the town before with new cultural facilities and visionary things such as a cable car bobbing above the high street But it is a vision that many of the existing residents seem unlikely to be able to afford,test,ELE,ADV
