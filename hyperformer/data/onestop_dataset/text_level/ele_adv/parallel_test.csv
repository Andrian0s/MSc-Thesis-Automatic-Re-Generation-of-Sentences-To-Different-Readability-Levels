18,Joseph Roche is on the shortlist of astronauts for Mars One a private mission that plans to send humans to live on Mars from 2025 He is on the shortlist but he is sceptical about Mars One Roche is an astrophysicist at Trinity College Dublin He is one of the 100 people on the shortlist for the mission He has doubts about Mars One The selection process Roche says did not reach the standard of more traditional astronaut selection processes He also says the Dutch Mars One team are naive because they believe they can succeed alone in the 6 billion mission He says they should now accept it will probably not happen The group plans to send a lander and satellite to Mars in 2018 followed by a rover in 2020 and cargo missions starting in 2022 Humans will start arriving in 2025 and they will send more crews of four people every two years The astronauts will not return to Earth Gerard t Hooft is a Dutch Nobel laureate in physics He is a supporter of the project but he says he does not believe the Mars One plans are realistic He said It will take longer and be more expensive When they asked me to be involved I told them You have to put a zero after everything Roche also said that there were not 200000 people who applied to be astronauts as Mars One said there were only 2761 He talked about the selection process in more detail I have not met anyone from Mars One At first they said there would be regional interviews we would travel there and they would interview and test us over several days To me that sounded like a proper astronaut selection process But it changed from a proper regional interview over several days to a tenminute Skype call Roche says he does not want to give more interviews because he doesnt want to sound negative about space travel He said that being involved in the public debate about future missions is one of the most interesting and enjoyable things about his connection with Mars One He then said that If a oneway mission to Mars ever became possible I would always volunteer For an astrophysicist that is not a difficult decision to make But he does not think there will be a oneway mission in his lifetime,He is not the first person to express scepticism about Mars One a vastly ambitious private mission aiming to settle humans on Mars from 2025 But Joseph Roche is different from most critics hes on the shortlist of astronauts Roche an astrophysicist at Trinity College Dublin who was announced in February as among the 100 people in line for the mission has written for the Guardian expressing his grave doubts about the viability of Mars One The selection process Roche writes was not rigorous enough to reach the requisite standard of more traditional astronaut selection programmes He also says the Dutch Mars One team have displayed a certain naivety in believing they can succeed alone in the supposed 6bn mission and should now accept it is very unlikely to happen He writes More openness and transparency would benefit Mars One greatly but I think that the shortcomings of the selection process coupled with their unwillingness to engage and collaborate with the scientific community mean that the time might have come for Mars One to acknowledge the implausibility of this particular venture and turn their efforts towards supporting other exciting and more viable upcoming space missions Roche also expressed worries about the way the mission organizers publicized a socalled topten candidates The ranking he said didnt mean these were the most likely potential astronauts but was instead based on how many supporter points each had earned through acts such as buying official merchandise He writes These points are Mars Ones supporter points which represent the degree of your support to Mars Ones mission These points play no role in the selection process and serve only to show how much each supporter has donated to Mars One The official timeline for the mission says the group plans to dispatch a stationary lander and satellite to Mars in 2018 followed by a rover in 2020 and cargo missions starting in 2022 Humans would start arriving in 2025 and crews of four would be sent every two years to add to the settlement They would not return to Earth In February a prominent supporter of the project Gerard t Hooft a Dutch Nobel laureate in physics said he did not believe this timetable was realistic He said It will take quite a bit longer and be quite a bit more expensive When they first asked me to be involved I told them You have to put a zero after everything Roche also spoke to Medium a US blogging platform that has previously expressed grave sceptism about Mars One reporting among other things that the supposed 200000 applications to be astronauts in fact totalled 2761 He told Medium about the selection process in more detail I have not met anyone from Mars One in person Initially theyd said there were going to be regional interviews we would travel there wed be interviewed wed be tested over several days and in my mind that sounded at least like something that approached a legitimate astronaut selection process But then they made us sign a nondisclosure agreement if we wanted to be interviewed and then all of a sudden it changed from being a proper regional interview over several days to being a tenminute Skype call Roche told the Guardian he did not want to give more interviews as he was wary about being negative about the idea of space travel In his comment piece he writes I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of scientific endeavour and that is why the ambitiousness of the Mars One plan appealed to me Although Mars One were never likely to overcome the financial and technical barriers during their proposed timeline it was refreshing to hear a new idea that challenges us to think about our own role in the future of space exploration Being part of the subsequent public debate over the ethics and morality of future missions has been one of the most interesting and enjoyable aspects of my candidacy with Mars One If a oneway mission to Mars ever became possible then I would always volunteer For an astrophysicist that is not a difficult decision to make but it is also a moot point because I do not think we will see a oneway mission in my lifetime,test,ELE,ADV
134,How long can you hold your breath Im trying it right now The rst 30 seconds are easy I want to give up at 45 seconds but I continue and it gets easier for a while But as I go past one minute my heart is pounding I breathe out a tiny bit and this helps One minute and 12 seconds Im quite impressed with myself In some sports it is very important to be able to hold your breath particularly in freediving In 2006 I met Sam Amps who was captain of the UK freedive team At a swimming pool in Bristol she taught me some simple ways to help me hold my breath for longer while swimming underwater By the end of the session I could hold my breath for 90 seconds long enough to let me swim across the pool Sam swam across the pool three times easily She could hold her breath for ve minutes while swimming Five minutes I asked how she did it very slow breathing for several minutes before each dive then a big deep breath before diving in Our heart rate doesnt slow down when we hold our breath At least it doesnt if youre doing it on land When youre under cold water the heart rate slows down in most people This change in our bodies is useful in diving but it is even more useful for not drowning Holding our breath is becoming very useful in one particular area of medicine Radiotherapy for breast cancer involves pointing radiation exactly at the tumour Its usually done in short periods between breaths But if the patient can hold their breath for several minutes it means that doctors can give the complete radiation dose in the right place all at the same time The problem of course is that most people cannot hold their breath for several minutes But doctors at University Hospital Birmingham have shown that if patients are given air with extra oxygen before holding their breath they can hold it for veandahalf minutes Surprisingly to achieve this you have to fool the diaphragm When you breathe in youre pulling the muscle of your diaphragm at so that the volume of your chest increases this pulls the air into your lungs When you hold your breath you keep your diaphragm like that If you breathe extra oxygen before a breathhold as in the Birmingham radiotherapy experiments you may be able to stop the diaphragm from becoming tired too quickly So its your diaphragm the main muscle of breathing that is in charge when you are holding your breath But in the end even if youve fooled it for a while the signals from the diaphragm become too strong and you have to give up and take a breath,How long can you hold your breath Im trying it right now The rst 30 seconds are easy Im ready to give up at 45 seconds but I push on through and it seems to get easier for a while But as the second hand ticks past a minute I know Im on borrowed time My heart is pounding I let out a tiny breath and this helps Eventually I give in expelling the spent air in my lungs and taking a huge gasp And continue to gasp for a few more breaths prompting my husband to ask what on earth Im doing I manage one minute and 12 seconds Im quite impressed with myself Breathholding ability becomes extremely important in some sports particularly freediving In 2006 I was lming a programme about the anatomy and physiology of the lungs for a BBC series called slightly oddly Dont Die Young I was lucky enough to meet Sam Amps who was captain of the UK freedive team At a pool in Bristol she taught me some simple exercises to help me hold my breath for longer while swimming underwater By the end of the session I think Id managed a prodigious 90 seconds of breathholding enough to let me swim a width Sam swam three widths with ease She could hold her breath for ve minutes while swimming Five I asked how she did it very slow breathing for several minutes prior to each dive then a big deep breath before diving in She also said training helped her resist the urge to breathe for far longer than most people Some have suggested that the ability to voluntarily hold your breath is evidence of a watery episode in human evolution Its even been said that humans have an ability to lower heart rate and metabolic rate in order to breathhold for even longer Other anatomical and physiological bits and bobs our hairlessness the distribution of our subcutaneous fat and even our tendency to walk on two legs have been linked to an aquatic phase of evolutionary development Unfortunately the cobbledtogether aquatic ape hypothesis fails to hold water Its a romantic notion that may appeal to us but with the cold light of day falling on the scienti c evidence its revealed to be nothing more than a fiction Looking at voluntary breathholding it turns out that were certainly not unique among nonaquatic mammals in being able to hold our breath Having said that its a dif cult thing to investigate in other mammals as unlike humans they tend not to comply when you ask them to breathhold And experimental evidence shows that heart rate doesnt drop during breathholding At least it doesnt if youre breathholding on land When youre submerged in cold water its a different story cooling the face does lead to a slower heart rate in most people But once again this isnt evidence of an aquatic ape ancestry as it turns out to be a very general characteristic of airbreathing vertebrates This reduction in heart rate is just one of the physiological responses that are sometimes described together as the mammalian diving re ex But physiological responses that could be useful in diving are also and perhaps even more importantly useful for not drowning While our ability to breathhold may not be all that special when we compare ourselves with other animals its now proving very useful in one particular area of medicine Radiotherapy for breast cancer involves directing radiation very precisely at the tumour This may require several minutes worth of radiation and so its usually done in short bursts between breaths But if the patient can keep her chest perfectly still for several minutes it means that the entire dose can be delivered in the right place in one go The problem of course is that most people just like me struggle to hold their breath for much longer than a minute But doctors at University Hospital Birmingham have recently performed careful experiments that show that if patients are ventilated with oxygenrich air before attempting a breath hold they can manage to hold their breath for an impressive veandahalf minutes Surprisingly the trick seems to lie not in fooling the bodys usual sensors for low oxygen or high carbon dioxide levels in the blood but in fooling the diaphragm When you breathe in youre contracting the muscle of your diaphragm pulling it at so that the volume of your chest increases and air is drawn into your lungs When you hold your breath you keep your diaphragm in this contracted state Arti cially raising oxygen levels and reducing carbon dioxide levels before a breathhold as in the Birmingham radiotherapy experiments may work by delaying fatigue in the diaphragm And not so useful if youre trying to keep your chest perfectly still breathing out a little air lets the diaphragm relax a little and helps you to prolong a breathhold exactly as I found when attempting my breathhold And so its your diaphragm the main muscle of breathing that is also in charge when it comes to reaching the breakpoint of your breathhold Eventually even if youve fooled it for a while the signals from the diaphragm are just too strong and you have to give in and take a breath,test,ELE,ADV

spent money on good social housing This makes Vienna a cheap place to live compared to other big cities I live in a 100 squaremetre apartment in a good area about 20 minutes walk from the city centre But my rent is just 800 625 a month A similar apartment in London costs over 2000 and even more in New York which came 44th in the study US cities do badly in the study mostly because of worries about

Vienna as the hub for companies wanting to do business in Central Europe According to the World Bank Austria has one of the highest gures for GDP per head in the world just behind the US and ahead of

Mercer It scores highly in a number of categories it provides a safe and stable environment to live in a high level of public utilities and transport facilities and good recreational facilities The European migrant crisis which has seen large numbers of refugees and asylum seekers pass through Vienna en route to Germany has had little impact on the city of nearly 18 million people said Eichtinger We have managed to accommodate 90000 refugees in Austria but the numbers have slowed in recent months London has never been in the qualityoflife top ten says Mercer damaged by its poor scores for air pollution traf c congestion and climate After London Edinburgh is the nextranking British city in 46th place Paris has suffered the biggest fall in the most recent rankings Paris remained stable for several years but has this year dropped ten places in the overall ranking said Mercer The drop was essentially due to the terrorist attacks in 2015 However it is important to

125,A new computerassisted autopsy system is becoming more and more popular in European hospitals Its inventor says that the system could mean that now there will be no such thing as a perfect murder The method called Virtopsy is being used at some forensic medical institutes in Europe It was invented by a group of scientists at the University of Zurich Instead of cutting the chest like in a traditional autopsy pathologists are now able to examine the dead body in 3D via computer screens Michael Thali the Director of Zurichs Institute for Forensic Medicine in Europe and one of the inventors of Virtopsy said it could completely change criminal investigations Basically there will be no such thing as the perfect murder any more because a virtual autopsy allows you to find every piece of evidence he said Virtopsies use powerful machines Together the machines are called a Virtobot Virtopsies can find injuries that are not seen during a traditional autopsy as well as air pockets heart attacks and even cancer The Virtopsy could replace the autopsy one day said Richard Dirndorfer one of the first people to use DNA analysis in criminology I think well see it happen slowly just like DNA analysis slowly replaced blood group analysis The method allows doctors to see deep inside dead bodies It can see things that cannot be found during traditional autopsies Criminologists from around the world have been travelling to Switzerland over the past few years to see the new method Forensic scientists and pathologists think the method can be used together with the traditional autopsy In order to analyze the colour of the blood the thickness of body fluids or smells well need to use traditional autopsy methods said Lars Oesterhelweg Deputy Director of the Institute of Forensic Medicine at the Charit Hospital in Berlin which is using a version of the Virtopsy He added that the new method was very helpful in reexamining cases where the cause of death was unclear It means that investigations can be reexamined and we can try again to find the murderer he said Scientists said that relatives of the dead prefer the Virtopsy method because during a traditional autopsy scientists have to cut and damage the dead body,The inventor of a stateoftheart computerassisted autopsy system that is increasingly being used in European hospitals has claimed the technique could eventually mean there is no such thing as a perfect murder The method called Virtopsy is now being used at selected forensic medical institutes in Europe having been pioneered by a group of scientists at the University of Zurich Instead of reaching for the scalpel and making the Yshaped incision in the chest with which a traditional autopsy begins pathologists are now able to examine the corpse in 3D via computer screens Michael Thali the Director of Zurichs Institute for Forensic Medicine in Europe and one of the inventors of Virtopsy said it had the potential to revolutionize criminal investigations Basically there will be no such thing as the perfect murder any more as a virtual autopsy allows you to find every piece of evidence he said Virtopsies combine the images from highpowered magnetic resonance imaging MRI computed tomography CT and surface scans of dead bodies Combined the devices are referred to as a Virtobot The technique allows the detection of injuries such as lesions and blows often undetectable during a traditional autopsy as well as air pockets heart attacks and even cancer The Virtopsy has the potential to replace the autopsy one day Richard Dirndorfer one of the pioneers of DNA analysis in criminology and a founder developer of Virtopsy told the German science magazine PM I think well see it happen gradually just like DNA analysis gradually replaced blood group analysis he said The computer imaging techniques allow doctors to gain indepth insights into the deepest interiors of dead bodies The method has already allowed the discovery of haemorrhages and fractures that were not picked up during conventional autopsies The initial aim is to use the new method to complement the traditional autopsy It will enable forensic scientists to plan their autopsies far more efficiently Dominic Wichmann an internal medicine specialist at Hamburgs University Hospital told Spiegel Criminologists from around the world have been travelling to Switzerland over the past few years to see the development of the new method for themselves The US forensic medical drama CSI has already twice featured Virtopsies In one the system was able to prove that a murder victim was killed by a bullet through the cheek in another a Virtopsy on a murdered man meant his wish to be cryogenically frozen could still go ahead as his body remained intact The method has been under development for decades with the scientists behind it first housed in an unheated laboratory on a university campus where they were considered a bit of a laughing stock Later a donation from a rich ophthalmologist enabled the project to take off Even then it was initially rejected for its potential to undermine the traditional skills of forensic scientists and pathologists But a new generation appears to be seeing it as less of a threat and rather as something that will complement and substantiate conventional methods and possibly even one day replace them though probably not entirely In order to analyze the colour of the blood the consistencies of body fluids or smells well need to keep on with the conventional cut said Lars Oesterhelweg Deputy Director of the Institute of Forensic Medicine at the Charit Hospital in Berlin which is using a version of the Virtopsy He added that the new method was particularly helpful in reexamining cases where the cause of death was unclear It means that third opinions can be gathered investigations can be reexamined and cases can be reopened he said Scientists using the new method said that relatives of the dead who are often reluctant for autopsies to be carried out because of the disfigurement they cause were much keener on the noninvasive method,test,ELE,ADV
135,Thousands of people protested on Australias beaches against a shark cull in Western Australia They asked the states prime minister to stop the cull and RSPCA Australia and Virgin Atlantic owner Richard Branson criticized it Catching and killing sharks longer than three metres began after a number of shark attacks on Western Australias coast A 35yearold surfer who was killed in November 2013 was the sixth person to die from a shark attack in two years But the whole of Australia has had on average just one sharkrelated death a year for the last 50 years Kate Faehrmann of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society said from a protest in Perth the state capital of Western Australia Weve always said that this idea wont work Drumlines which they use to catch the sharks kill sharks if theyre one two three metres or more and also dolphins turtles and other things Thats why we dont want the cull Thousands of people protested on beaches in the cities of Perth Sydney and Adelaide and at beaches in Victoria and Queensland Faehrmann said the protests showed that Australians wanted sharks to be protected Whats amazing is that so many people in Australia love sharks This has shown that people are scared but thousands of people are coming out across the country to say Thats the sharks ocean We respect them we love them and we dont want you to kill them Anthony Joyce a surfer who once had his foot caught in a sharks mouth said The number of sharks they are going to kill is going to make no difference The state government will not say how many sharks they have killed but some people say that sharks smaller than three metres were released after they were caught on drumlines oating drums xed to the sea bed with bait on hooks underneath them Conservationists say there is no evidence the cull will reduce the number of shark attacks on humans because no other cull has only used drumlines Researchers at the University of Western Australia say the increased number of shark attacks in the state may be because Western Australia has the fastestgrowing population in Australia not because of a rising number of sharks Richard Peirce of the UKbased conservation charity the Shark Trust said that the cull would not work and could bring more predators towards the coast The activity in Western Australia is adding to the human tragedy of shark attacks It is very sad that a government has ignored the best advice and chosen a method that is ineffective and counterproductive he said and even if they monitor drumlines through the day leaving the lines in at night could attract other predators to the area attracted by those sharks and other species hooked and injured Worldwide in 2012 there were 80 attacks by sharks Seven of the attacks were fatal This is compared to nearly 100 million sharks killed by humans each year RSPCA Australia says it believes the cull is wrong There is no evidence that the increase in attacks is a result of increasing shark numbers We think it is the result of a changing population and changing human behaviour that is there are more people in the water it said Richard Branson said the idea was not working Im sure one of the reasons Western Australia Premier Colin Barnett did it was because he was thinking it would encourage tourism Its going to do the opposite I think Youre advertising a problem that doesnt exist in a big way and youre going to stop people from wanting to come to Perth and your beautiful countryside around it All youre going to achieve I think is to worry people,Opposition to Western Australias shark cull has intensi ed as thousands of people took to beaches across the continent to call on the states premier to end the policy and RSPCA Australia and Virgin Atlantic owner Richard Branson spoke out against it The controversial catching and killing of sharks longer than three metres began after what the state government called an unprecedented number of shark attacks on Western Australias coast which saw a 35yearold surfer killed in November 2013 He was the sixth person to die from a shark attack in two years However according to the Shark Attack File Australia as a whole has averaged one shark related fatality a year for the last 50 years Kate Faehrmann a board member at the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society said from a protest in Perth Weve been saying all along that this policy wont work Drumlines used to catch the sharks are indiscriminate killers Theyll kill sharks whether theyre one two three metres or more as well as dolphins turtles and other things Thats why the community doesnt want it Thousands of people protested on Perths Cottesloe Beach and Sydneys Manly Beach as well as hundreds at Glenelg in south west Adelaide and at beaches in Victoria and Queensland Faehrmann said the protests had shown Australians wanted sharks protected Whats amazing is so many people in Australia love sharks This has demonstrated something about the national psyche that despite Jaws despite all the fear people are coming out in their thousands across the country to say Thats their ocean We respect them we love them and we dont want them killed Anthony Joyce a surfer who once had his foot caught in a sharks mouth said The number of sharks they are going to kill is going to make no difference in the scheme of things The state government has refused to provide a running tally of sharks killed though there have been reports of sharks smaller than three metres being released after getting caught on drumlines oating drums anchored to the sea bed with bait hanging on hooks beneath them Conservationists argue there is no evidence the cull will reduce the number of shark attacks on humans as no previous cull has solely used drumlines Researchers at the University of Western Australia say the recent spate of shark attacks in the state may have more to do with the state having the fastestgrowing population in Australia rather than a rising number of sharks Richard Peirce chairman of the UKbased conservation charity the Shark Trust said that the cull would be ineffective and potentially lure more predators towards the coast The activity in Western Australia is compounding the human tragedy of shark attacks It is very sad that a government that could be seen to take positive initiatives with regards to shark human interactions by trialling alternatives to indiscriminate killing has ignored the best advice and opted for an approach that is ineffective and counterproductive he said The indiscriminate nature of drumlines is often overlooked even if monitored through the day leaving the lines in overnight has the potential to attract other predators into the area attracted by those sharks and other species hooked and injured Globally in 2012 there were 80 unprovoked attacks by sharks seven of which proved fatal compared to nearly 100m sharks killed by humans each year RSPCA Australia released a statement saying it believes the cull is unjusti ed There is no evidence that the increase in attacks is a result of increasing shark numbers Rather it is consistent with a changing population and human behaviour that is there are greater numbers of people in the water it said Richard Branson told Fairfax Radio the policy was back ring Im sure one of the reasons Western Australia Premier Colin Barnett did it was because he was thinking it would encourage tourism Its going to do quite the reverse I think Youre advertising a problem that doesnt exist in a major way and youre deterring people from wanting to come to Perth and your beautiful countryside

67,We all know about wildlife emergencies such as the possible extinction of the tiger in India the orangutan in Indonesia and the panda Everybody loves these animals and no one wants to see them disappear But now scientists are worried that the threat to creatures such as ladybirds is a much greater danger to biodiversity Climate change falling numbers of animals rising numbers of humans and extinction mean that more and more scientists now believe that we are in the Anthropocene age the age of extinction A recent report from the World Wildlife Fund WWF confirms that worrying idea statistics from the report show a very big reduction in the numbers of many species The number of vertebrates has declined by 52 over the last forty years We are losing too many species Some populations of mammals birds reptiles and amphibians have reduced even more with freshwater species declining by 76 over the same period But its the creatures that help us the most that are worrying many scientists Three quarters of the worlds food production depends on bees and other insects Pandas are cute and tigers are beautiful but other animals are more useful its worms that turn our waste into nutrients and bats that catch mosquitoes and keep malaria rates down Its the loss of the common species that will affect people The loss of the rarer creatures will not affect us much because were not reliant on them in such an obvious way said Dr Nick Isaac who studies the environment He says that Britains insects and other invertebrates are declining just as fast as vertebrates He says that this will cause serious problems for humans He said that between 23 and 36 of all birds mammals and amphibians that we use for food or medicine might become extinct In many parts of the world wild animals are an important part of the diet particularly for the poor Most people also blame humans humans damage ecosystems create climate change and destroy habitats But this time its not just the big cuddly mammals we have to worry about losing but the smaller creatures that are less easy to see We depend on insects creepycrawlies and even worms They might not become extinct very soon but a decline in their numbers will affect us all We are going to feel the effect of those losses The numbers of both invertebrates and vertebrates are declining Its not so simple as fish die and people starve its more complex said Isaac Humans said TV naturalist Sir David Attenborough in 2013 are a plague on earth But the WWF claims there is still time to stop the decline Its UK Chief Executive David Nussbaum said The amount of destruction shown in this report should make us all change our behaviour We all politicians business and people have a responsibility to protect what we all value a healthy future for people and nature Humans are cutting down too many trees too quickly fishing too many fish taking too much water from our rivers and producing too much carbon he said,The threatened extinction of the tiger in India the perilous existence of the orangutan in Indonesia the plight of the panda these are wildlife emergencies with which we have become familiar They are wellloved animals that no one wants to see disappear But now scientists fear the real impact of declining wildlife could be closer to home with the threat to creatures such as ladybirds posing the gravest danger to biodiversity Climate change declining numbers of animals rising numbers of humans and the rapid rate of species extinction mean a growing number of scientists now declare us to be in the Anthropocene the geological age of extinction when humans finally dominate the ecosystems WWFs Living Planet Index LPI 2014 seemed to confirm that grim picture with statistics on the worlds wildlife population that showed a dramatic reduction in numbers across countless species The LPI showed the number of vertebrates had declined by 52 over four decades Biodiversity loss has now reached critical levels Some populations of mammals birds reptiles and amphibians have suffered even bigger losses with freshwater species declining by 76 over the same period But its the creatures that provide the most natural capital or ecosystem services that are getting many scientists really worried Three quarters of the worlds food production is thought to depend on bees and other pollinators such as hoverflies Never mind how cute a panda is or how stunning a tiger its worms that are grinding up our waste and taking it deep into the soil to turn into nutrients and bats that are catching mosquitoes and keeping malaria rates down A study in North America has valued the loss of pest control from ongoing bat declines at more than 22bn in lost agricultural productivity Its the loss of the common species that will impact on people not so much the rarer creatures because by the very nature of their rarity were not reliant on them in such an obvious way said Dr Nick Isaac a macroecologist at the Centre for Ecology Hydrology in Oxfordshire He says that recent work he and colleagues have been doing suggests that Britains insects and other invertebrates are declining just as fast as vertebrates with serious consequences for humanity The really interesting thing about this work is that we are learning that it s not just about the numbers of species going extinct but the actual numbers in a population that s the beginning of a fundamental shift in our understanding he says He pointed to the fact that between 23 and 36 of all birds mammals and amphibians used for food or medicine are now threatened with extinction In many parts of the world wildanimal food sources are a critical part of the diet particularly for the poor The blame most agree sits with unsustainable human consumption damaging ecosystems creating climate change and destroying habitats at a far faster rate than previously thought But this time its not just the big cuddly mammals we have to worry about losing but the smaller less visible creatures upon which we depend insects creepycrawlies and even worms They might not be facing immediate extinction but a decline in their numbers will affect us all We are going to feel the impact of those losses With the UK species the pattern is much the same with invertebrates as it is with vertebrates Its not as simplistic as fish die and people starve its more complex said Isaac Humans said TV naturalist Sir David Attenborough in 2013 are a plague on earth but WWF claims there is still time to stop the rot Its UK Chief Executive David Nussbaum said The scale of the destruction highlighted in this report should act as a wakeup call for us all We all politicians business and people have an interest and a responsibility to act to ensure we protect what we all value a healthy future for people and nature Humans are cutting down trees more quickly than they can regrow harvesting more fish than the oceans can restock pumping water from our rivers and aquifers faster than rainfall can replenish them and emitting more carbon than the oceans and forests can absorb he said,test,ELE,ADV

104,Male bosses are paid bonuses double the size of bonuses given to female colleagues in the same jobs This means that men get bonuses of 141500 more than women over their working lives The numbers released by the Chartered Management Institute CMI show that men in UK management jobs earned average bonuses of 6442 in 2012 compared with 3029 for women Female directors received bonuses of 36270 over the past 12 months compared with 63700 received by male directors The numbers show that pay in British business is still not equal Campaigners believe we must do something to improve equality at work Ann Francke the CMIs chief executive said that there should be more flexibility and less masculine cultures and that the good work people do should be more important than how much time they spend in the office Also there should be more transparency around performance and bonuses If we solve this issue we will improve the performance of organizations and the wellbeing of people at work she said What are we waiting for Some of the numbers may be affected by women doing jobs where there is less of a culture of bonus payments But the differences in the sizes of bonuses do make Britains pay gap worse The government says the pay gap is closing but that fulltime male employees still earn 10 more than women Maria Miller the Minister for Women and Equalities said that the CMI numbers are another example from the world of work that shows that women still earn less than men doing the same job Changes in the workplace are happening and its good that the pay gap is closing but there is still more to do before we see full equality in the workplace The government is trying to help 120 companies have joined our Think Act Report scheme which encourages companies to improve the way they recruit promote and pay women Weve also looked at other causes of the pay gap such as having to juggle work and family Large companies such as Tesco BT Unilever and the international law firm Eversheds are some of the companies that have signed up to Think Act Report The scheme has only attracted 120 companies in nearly two years But the CMIs numbers also showed that the pay gap is closing the difference between the average salaries earned by male and female bosses appeared to be smaller than in 2012,Male bosses are being paid bonuses double the size of those given to female colleagues in identical jobs a disparity that means men enjoy salary topups of 141500 more than women over the course of a working lifetime The figures released by the Chartered Management Institute CMI reveal that men in UK management roles earned average bonuses of 6442 in 2012 compared with 3029 for women In the most senior roles female directors received bonuses of 36270 over the past 12 months compared with 63700 awarded to male directors The latest figures highlighting the inequitable nature of pay in British business led to calls for action from campaigners on workplace equality Ann Francke the CMIs chief executive said Its time to move this issue into the mainstream management agenda This is about changing our approach to management to allow for greater flexibility less masculine cultures more emphasis on outcomes rather than time in the office and greater transparency around performance and rewards In solving this issue we would actually raise the performance of organizations and the wellbeing of individuals at work What are we waiting for Dr Ruth Sealy a senior research fellow at Cranfield School of Management added It is not surprising Bonuses are a method of payment that can be used with discretion As to what should be done about it these things should be made more transparent While statisticians warned that some of the data may be skewed by factors such as women entering occupations where there is less of a culture of bonus payments the discrepancies in the sizes of awards do appear to be aggravating Britains pay gap which the government says is closing but still sees fulltime male employees earn 10 more than women Maria Miller the Minister for Women and Equalities said The CMI figures are yet another damaging example highlighting that in the world of work women still lose out to their male counterparts and that the playing field is far from level Changes in the workplace are happening and its good that the pay gap is closing but there is still more to do before we see full equality in the workplace The government is playing its part we have made pay secrecy clauses illegal given tribunals the power to force employers who break equal pay laws to carry out equal pay audits and signed 120 companies up to our Think Act Report scheme which encourages companies to improve the way they recruit promote and pay women Weve also looked at other pay gap causes such as having to juggle work and family responsibilities by introducing shared parental leave and the right to request flexible working to all employees Large companies such as Tesco BT Unilever and the international law firm Eversheds are among those signed up to Think Act Report The scheme has only attracted 120 supporters in nearly two years of existence having risen from 54 participants in November 2012 However the CMIs data did provide some evidence to support Millers contention that the overall pay gap is narrowing the difference between the average salaries earned by male and female bosses has appeared to shrink decreasing from an average of 10060 in 2012 to 8502 in the CMIs most recent figures However the institute cautioned against direct comparisons between the 2012 and 2013 samples which both polled around 40000 managers as they are not identical A subset of 17000 individual managers whose salaries and bonuses have been tracked over a number of years showed that male managers earnings are rising faster than womens for the first time in five years with men enjoying total increases of 32 compared with 28 for women when salaries and bonuses are combined At the most senior level male directors earnings rose by 53 over the past 12 months compared with just 11 for female directors,test,ELE,ADV
94,A car with a maximum speed of 25 miles per hour two seats and no pedals or steering wheel does not sound very interesting But Google in the US shocked the car and taxi industries when it unveiled the latest version of its driverless car Google has begun testing the electric car at its headquarters in Mountain View California The car does not have all the normal car controls such as foot pedals Instead it has a smartphone app that calls it and tells it the destination and a STOP button between the two seats in case the passengers need to override the computer The company is building about 100 prototypes for a twoyear test The companys cofounder Sergey Brin said that the vehicle was still just a prototype He says that they want to change the world for people who do not find it easy to travel around Talking about the car he said Youre just sitting there no steering wheel no pedals For me it was very relaxing About ten seconds after getting into the car I forgot I was there I found it really fun Google says that the aim of the project is to improve safety They say that the car is made with foam at the front and a plastic windscreen so it should be far safer than any other car for pedestrians The cars have been built specially by a company in Detroit Google will now test the cars which are not yet for sale There need to be detailed scans of the roads before the cars can drive on them because they cannot collect and process enough information in real time So far there are detailed maps of about 2000 miles of Californias roads but California has more than 170000 miles of roads Google says it wants to license the technology to traditional car makers when they have improved it But the idea that driverless cars will replace taxis with human drivers has alarmed some people Dennis Conyon from the UK National Taxi Association said that taxi drivers will become unemployed London has about 22000 black taxis and Conyon thinks that the total number of people who drive taxis in the UK is about 100000 Other car makers including Volvo Ford and Mercedes are going to make vehicles that will be different from Googles version because they will have driver controls But Chris Urmson director of the driverless car project at Google said that the new prototypes do not have a steering wheel or brakes because a human passenger might not be able to take control in an emergency He said that it was simpler just to have an emergency stop button Urmson said The vehicles will be very basic But they will take you where you want to go at the push of a button And thats an important step towards improving road safety and helping millions of people travel around more easily So far the Google versions of the driverless cars have driven 700000 miles without an accident caused by the computer The company says that thousands of people die each year on the roads and that about 80 of crashes are caused by human mistakes,Unveiling a car with a top speed of 25mph two seats and no pedals or steering wheel might not make much of an impression at a motor show But Google in the US sent a minor earthquake through the car and taxi industries as it unveiled the latest version of its driverless car The electrically powered vehicle which Google has begun testing around its headquarters in Mountain View California dispenses with all the normal controls including foot pedals Instead it has a smartphone app that summons it and tells it the destination and a single STOP button mounted between the two frontfacing seats in case the occupants need to override the computer The car in fact takes over all the tasks of navigation steering acceleration and braking The company is building about 100 prototypes for a twoyear test The companys cofounder Sergey Brin told a conference in California that the vehicle was still in the prototype stage but that the project was about changing the world for people who are not well served by transportation today He said of the car Youre just sitting there no steering wheel no pedals For me it was very relaxing About ten seconds after getting in I forgot I was there It reminded me of catching a chairlift by yourself a bit of solitude I found really enjoyable Google says that the principal aim of the project is to improve safety and that because the car is constructed with impactabsorbing foam at the front and a plastic windscreen it should be far safer than any other car for pedestrians The cars which have been built specially by a company as yet unnamed in Detroit will be used to investigate further how best to make driverless vehicles work Google will run a pilot programme using the cars which are not yet for sale One challenge is creating highdefinition scans of the roads and surroundings before the cars can drive along them because they cannot gather and process enough information in real time So far there are highdetail maps of about 2000 miles of Californias roads but the state has more than 170000 miles of public roads Google says it is interested in licensing the technology to traditional vehicle manufacturers once it has refined it sufficiently Members of the team had been working on the project even before joining Google for more than a decade But the prospect of driverless cars replacing humandriven taxis has been the cause of some alarm If you get rid of the driver then theyre unemployed said Dennis Conyon the southeast director for the UK National Taxi Association It would have a major impact on the labour force London has about 22000 licensed black cabs and Conyon estimates that the total number of people who drive taxis for hire in the UK is about 100000 However Steve McNamara general secretary of the 10500strong London Taxi Drivers Association said You wont get these driverless cars in London for 20 or 25 years Maybe by then theyll have a charge point because there isnt a single one in London now Other car makers including Volvo Ford and Mercedes are working on driverassisted vehicles which unlike Googles version do not dispense with the driver controls But Chris Urmson director of the selfdriving car project at Google said that the new prototypes dispensed with the steering wheel and brakes because there was no guarantee that a human occupant would be able to take over in an emergency and that it was simpler just to have an emergency stop button Urmson said The vehicles will be very basic We want to learn from them and adapt them as quickly as possible But they will take you where you want to go at the push of a button And thats an important step towards improving road safety and transforming mobility for millions of people So far the Google versions of the selfdriving cars have covered 700000 miles without an accident caused by the computer The company points out that thousands of people die each year on the roads and that about 80 of crashes can be ascribed to human error But they could have some way to go to match Conyon

41,Tua Pittman from Raratonga in the Cook Islands is a traditional navigator To him a canoe is more than just a form of transport The canoe is our island the crew is the community and the navigator is the leader he says On a canoe you are not just going from one place to another using the stars the moon the sun and the birds Navigation is showing your crew the light of life It has been a busy week for the crews of four sailing canoes they are in Sydney for the start of the World Parks Congress Tuas journey began at the Cook Islands on 25 September The islanders sailed to Samoa then Fiji Vanuatu and onto the Gold Coast Then they travelled south to Sydney Around 100 crew were involved in the voyage and they tried to travel using only traditional navigation techniques Sadly said Tua the crews had to use modern navigation equipment sometimes to reach Australia in time for the Congress The trip is called the Mua Voyage It is a partnership between the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN Oceania Regional Of ce and ve Paci c Island countries Samoa Tonga New Zealand the Cook Islands and Fiji The main aim of the 11000km trip was to deliver a special message to the World Parks Congress The message said We see fewer sh than in the past and they are smaller And foreign sherman take our sh Our coral reefs the greatest in the world and our shing grounds are disappearing Our ocean is very big but not limitless The Paci c Islanders message to the delegates of the Congress was urgent But a lot of time has been spent at the Congress trying to set a new target for the amount of the ocean that needs special protection According to the IUCN in 2013 less than three per cent of the worlds oceans was in marine protected areas and less than one per cent of that is no take no shing But there should be a lot more notake areas because the last World Parks Congress in 2003 set a target of 2030 After dif cult talks the World Parks Congress agreed new targets for marine protected areas The new target is not 2030 it is at least 30 And they must try to solve the problem of biodiversity Tua Pittman is very happy with what the Congress has decided for the worlds oceans Its a huge reward for all the effort that we made to be here To hear they made that decision is fantastic Its a step in the right direction He is 55 and in his lifetime he can already see that it is much harder to catch sh He also said that pollution is getting worse particularly close to big cities such as Sydney And climate change is already having a serious effect on Paci c Islanders The decisions of the big countries have a small effect on developed large countries but they have a very big effect on small countries The Mua Voyage had taken years of preparation and planning It was critical to the voyagers that the world listened to their message and took action Pittman said that the leaders of rich countries should think more like traditional navigators who see that their boats are just tiny specks in an enormous sea Most importantly Tua says that politicians must change how they do things The world needs to nd a different path The Mua Voyage had taken years of preparation

aimed to travel using only traditional navigation techniques Unfortunately said Tua the crews were forced to rely on modern navigation equipment on some occasions to reach Australia in time for the Congress The of cial title of the expedition is the Mua Voyage and it is a partnership between the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN Oceania Regional Of ce and ve Paci c Island countries Samoa Tonga New Zealand the Cook Islands and Fiji The main goal of the 6000nauticalmile 11000km trip was to deliver a special message to the World Parks Congress In part the message said We see the signs of overexploitation We no longer see the sh and other marine creatures in the size diversity or abundance of the past We witness the change as foreign shing eets ply our waters in a race to strip our resources Our coral reefs the greatest in the world and our mangrove and wetland spawning grounds are disappearing Our ocean is vast but not limitless Growing global populations and the relentless pursuit of unsustainable development are reducing the ability of our ocean to sustain life In spite of the effort and urgency behind the Paci c Islanders message to the delegates of the Congress much of the nal days of the marine part of the Congress were taken up with trying to set a revised target for the amount of the ocean that needs to be protected in marine sanctuaries According to the IUCN as of 2013 the amount of the worlds oceans in marine protected areas was not even three per cent and less than one per cent of that is no take This was despite a target of 2030 notake areas set by the last World Parks Congress held in South Africa in 2003 Worldleading marine scientist Professor Callum Roberts from the University of York was one of the scientists who helped set the 2030 target in 2003 But he said it was not enough The IUCN should now lift its target from 30 to 33 New research strengthens the case for the 30 target set previously to now be raised Any reduction in efforts at this stage and moment in history would be disastrous for our oceans After dif cult negotiations the World Parks Congress delegates passed a motion that will dramatically shift the goals for global marine management Instead of the 2030 aspirational target the IUCNs new of cial position is to urgently increase the ocean area that is effectively and equitably managed in ecologically representative and wellconnected systems of MPAs marine protected areas or other effective conservation measures by 2030 these should include strictly protected areas that amount to at least 30 of each marine habitat and address both biodiversity and ecosystem services Tua Pittman was delighted with the news that a strong resolution on the planets oceans had passed the Congress Its just like a huge reward for all the effort that we made to be here and to be heard To hear they made that resolution is fantastic Its a step in the right direction He says that while much of the traditional navigational aids were things such as the sun moon and stars that never changed and would at least on a human scale always be there other impacts of environmental degradation were becoming clearer when voyaging across the Paci c He said he was 55 and in his lifetime he was already beginning to see that it was much harder to catch sh on the open ocean He also said that pollution was worsening particularly as the canoes approached big cities such as Sydney And the effects of climate change were already beginning to impact seriously on Paci c Islanders The decisions of the big countries have twice thrice four times the impact on the small countries than on developed large nations Many times people dont even know where our islands are and from the eyes of a traditional navigator our people have a very very deep concern because we are talking about decisions made far away that impact on our homes The Mua Voyage had been a massive logistical undertaking said Tua Years of preparation and navigational planning went into such a trip and it was critical to the voyagers that the world listened to their message and acted The leaders of wealthy countries he went on need to start to think more like traditional navigators who recognize their vessels are mere specks in an enormous sea Most importantly and spoken like a true navigator Tua says politicians must seek a different route to avoid the pending ecological crises that are beginning to befall the small island nations The world needs to nd a different path,test,ELE,ADV

avours Toppings include fresh fruit honey chocolate chips and granola They can also buy black tea and coffee The shop which has ice cream coffee dreams written on its signs is taking advantage of local peoples curiosity about ice cream and the shop is also changing lives says Inzozi Nzizas manager Louise Ingabire Ice cream is important she says between mouthfuls of honey avoured ice cream Some Rwandans like ice cream but its a new thing We still have some work to do to tell others that theyll enjoy it The shop can certainly make dreams come true I didnt have a job before I just stayed at home Now I have a vision for the future I am making money and I can give some of it to my family says the 27yearold Butare has 89600 residents and is 135km south of the capital Kigali It is the home of the National University of Rwanda Inzozi Nziza has become a meeting place for students who want to treat themselves to something cool and different The shop is uniting people here Kalisa Migendo a 24yearold student says If you need to go out and talk to a friend a girl or a boy you come to Inzozi Nziza for an ice cream Inzozi Nziza was opened by Odile Gakire Katese She met Alexis Miesen and Jennie Dundas co founders of Blue Marble Ice Cream in Brooklyn New York The three women formed a partnership to open the shop in 2010 At the start Miesen and Dundas owned the shop in partnership with its employees and had shares in the business which is a cooperative After 18 months they gave their shares to the women employees who by then could control the business by themselves Ice cream is new to Rwanda Selling and eating ice cream is not part of the Rwandan culture The Butare shop employs nine women They spend their free time practising with Ingoma Nshya Rwandas rst and only female drumming group The musicians are Hutu and Tutsi women Some are survivors of the 1994 genocide when almost a million Tutsis and Hutus were killed Some members of Ingoma Nshya are widows some orphans Ingabires father two siblings and many cousins were killed in the genocide When Im drumming it gives me power because were still alive and survivors she says The icecream shop is in a documentary by lmmakers Rob and Lisa Fruchtman Sweet Dreams which tells the story of how the women have made a positive future after the genocide also includes the female drummers The lm has been shown in many

agriculture student says If you need to go out and talk to a friend a girl or a boy you come to Inzozi Nziza for an ice cream Most of the ingredients are sourced locally and the milk comes from a depot in nearby Nyanza The vanilla beans and cocoa are imported Inzozi Nziza was opened by the theatre director Odile Gakire Katese She met Alexis Miesen and Jennie Dundas cofounders of Blue Marble Ice Cream in Brooklyn New York and formed a partnership to open the shop in 2010 An icecream shop Katese proposed might help to put the human pieces back together by rebuilding spirits hopes and family traditions Miesen says At the start Miesen and Dundas owned the shop in partnership with its staff and had shares in the business which is a cooperative and nonpro t They did not set nancial targets but waited for 18 months before they transferred their shares to the women who had by then proved their business credentials The shops success is no exception says Fatuma Ndangiza deputy chief executive of the Rwanda Governance Board Small businesses are mostly managed by women but when it comes to big business where you have to compete for big tenders very few women are there Women are newcomers to big business she points out We have more women entrepreneurs Its an area where women are taking an interest both in and outside Kigali Though ice cream is somewhat new to Rwanda Ndangiza is enthused by the idea of the shop I think its great It requires a lot of skills and changing peoples mindsets because selling and eating ice cream is not part of our culture I think being able to innovate and introduce this on the market and the process of making it is quite interesting The Butare shop employs nine women who spend their spare time practising with Ingoma Nshya Rwandas rst and only female drumming troupe which was established by Katese ten years ago The musicians are Hutu and Tutsi women some survivors of the 1994 genocide during which almost a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed Some members of Ingoma Nshya are widows some orphans Others have been affected by the massacre in different ways Historically says Ingabire Rwandan women were forbidden to drum and many people considered the drums too heavy for women to carry But its something which brings unity Ingabires father two siblings and many cousins were killed in the genocide Some of us are survivors some know someone who was killed she says When Im drumming with them it gives me power because were still alive and survivors The popular eatery features in a documentary by Rob and Lisa Fruchtman

10,John Lewiss 2015 Christmas advert shows a lonely old man who lives on the moon Department store John Lewiss Christmas ad which for many people shows that the Christmas shopping season has begun aims to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds for the charity Age UK John Lewis will also encourage staff and customers to care for elderly people who might be alone over the holiday The department store has spent 7 million on a campaign that includes the TV ad a smartphone game and merchandise including glowinthedark pyjamas It has also built areas that look like the surface of the moon in 11 of its stores After two years of successful ads with cute animals a bear and hare then a penguin this time the story is about a young girl Lily who sees an old man living in a small wooden house on the moon through her telescope The girl tries to send him a letter and a note via bow and arrow Then she floats him a present of a telescope tied to balloons This helps them to make contact The ads message is Show someone theyre loved this Christmas This is similar to Age UKs campaign No one should have no one at Christmas Profits from three products a mug gift tag and card will go to the charity Rachel Swift head of marketing at John Lewis said that people talk about charities at Christmas and the ad makes you think about someone who lives on your street that might not see anybody The campaign features the Oasis track Half the World Away sung by Norwegian singer Aurora The ad cost 1 million to make The moon scenes were shot at the Warner Bros Studios where the Harry Potter films were made and the specially built set was created by one of the team behind the latest Star Wars film The Force Awakens As in the last few years John Lewis showed a short film on TV and social media using the hashtag OnTheMoon before it showed the full advert There will be a full moon on Christmas Day 2015 a complete coincidence says Swift In 2014 the department store also spent 7 million on a campaign with a penguin and a young boy playing together It had 22 million views on YouTube by the first week of January more than the 166m views of Sainsburys ad with First World War soldiers sharing a bar of chocolate the UKs second most popular ad of 2014 Swift said that John Lewis wants to just get something right for the company at this time of year and do something we hope customers really love Sarah Vizard from Marketing Week said There are a lot more companies doing Christmas ads this year but I think a lot of those companies just show what you can buy in store John Lewis does the emotional piece the best I think people will think the ad is really cute,A lonely old man living in a crater on the moon is the unlikely focus of John Lewiss Christmas 2015 advert as the department store puts a charitable spin on its latest multimillion pound campaign Amid increasing hype around John Lewiss seasonal ad which has come to mark the beginning of the Christmas shopping season for many the department store will aim to use its profile to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds for Age UK It will also encourage staff and customers to join up with their local branch of the charity to care for elderly people who might otherwise be alone over the holiday The retailer has spent 7m on a campaign that ranges from the slick TV ad to a smartphone game and merchandise including glowinthedark pyjamas as well as areas decked out like the surface of the moon in 11 stores After two years of successful ads featuring cuddly animals a bear and hare then a penguin this time the retailer is tugging at the heartstrings with a story of a young girl Lily who spots an old man living in a shack on the moon through her telescope The determined child tries sending him a letter and firing a note via bow and arrow before floating him a present of a telescope tied to balloons which finally enables them to make contact The ads strapline is Show someone theyre loved this Christmas which echoes Age UKs own campaign No one should have no one at Christmas Profits from three products a mug gift tag and card will go to the charity The charity really resonates with people at this time of year and the ad lends itself to thinking about someone who lives on your street that might not see anybody said Rachel Swift head of marketing at John Lewis The campaign features the Oasis track Half the World Away reinterpreted by littleknown Norwegian artist Aurora The ad cost 1m to make The moon scenes were shot at the Warner Bros Studios where the Harry Potter films were made and the specially built set was created by one of the team behind the latest Star Wars film The Force Awakens As in the last few years John Lewis has drummed up interest in their most recent ad with a teaser campaign on TV and social media using the hashtag OnTheMoon There will be a full moon on Christmas Day 2015 a complete coincidence according to Swift In 2014 the retailer also spent 7m on a campaign featuring a realistic animated penguin and a young boy playing together to the tune of John Lennons Real Love sung by British singersongwriter Tom Odell It had drummed up 22m views on YouTube by the first week of January ahead of the 166m clocked by Sainsburys ad featuring First World War soldiers sharing a bar of chocolate the UKs next most popular ad of 2014 Swift said that despite the hype John Lewis had stuck to the same strategy for the last five years Its all about thoughtful gifting and going the extra mile for someone you love at Christmas she said We dont go into it thinking This is going to be huge just getting something right for the brand at this time of year and something we hope customers really love Sarah Vizard news editor of trade journal Marketing Week said John Lewis appeared to have reined in its efforts this time with a lowerkey presence in stores despite a growing army of competitors There are definitely a lot more brands doing Christmas ads this year but I think a lot of those brands who tried to compete with John Lewis by doing something emotional and creative have gone back to what you can buy in store she said John Lewis still does the emotional piece the best This campaign is another great way of putting that across in a way that will resonate with customers I think people will think it is really cute Among those fighting for attention in the flurry of Christmas ads was sister chain Waitrose which launched its Christmas ad online on social media ahead of a TV debut during The X Factor It used the agency which has created John Lewiss Christmas ads for years Burberry has launched what is only its second festive film featuring Romeo Beckham and Elton John while electrical chain Currys drafted in Jeff Goldblum for its first ever dedicated Christmas ad Asda Lidl and Morrisons also launched their campaigns at the beginning of November Marc Bolland chief executive of Marks Spencer which also launched its Christmas ad at the beginning of November said that in the first week of September the most searched term on its website was Christmas Boots another retailer launching its festive campaign in early November is going back to a more traditional approach after a critically acclaimed ad in 2014 which featured a family going to great lengths to get together at Christmas,test,ELE,ADV
24,On average a girl born today in the UK will live to the age of nearly 82 and her brother will live to 78 They would have a longer life in Andorra the girl 85 and the boy 79 but will live a little longer than in the US 81 and 76 If they lived in the Central African Republic they would die in middle age 49 and 44 Almost everywhere in the world except countries such as Lesotho which have problems with HIV and violence life expectancy is increasing The best news is that small children die much less often than forty years ago There has been a reduction in deaths of underfives of nearly 60 from 164 million in 1970 to 68 million in 2010 Over the past five years the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation IHME in Seattle has led a very big project to look at the global effects of disease If we know how many children die and why the world can try to keep them alive The big IHME database will help global organizations and governments to better care for us all The project has been controversial IHME has been very radical in some of its methods When they didnt have death registries or medical records they decided the cause of death by an interview with the family called a verbal autopsy The most surprising result has been with malaria IHME said 12 million die of the disease every year this is twice as many as people believed The big increase is in adult deaths It is commonly believed that malaria kills mostly children under five We are taught as doctors that in areas with malaria you become semiimmune as an adult said Dr Christopher Murray IHME Director But he says the evidence tells them that may not be right African doctors write on hospital records that adults are dying of malaria a lot But their fever could be something different he adds The results have led to more studies Although the Director General of the World Health Organization was happy about the IHME study other people are not so sure We need to be very careful said Colin Mathers a senior scientist He thinks scientists need to find out if the numbers are correct One of the most important things in the study said Murray was the very fast change in the main causes of death and the speed of that change is a lot faster than we thought Reduced fertility and longer life have led to an increase in the average age of the worlds population in ten years from 26 years old to almost 30 The change has been dramatic in Latin America for example where countries like Brazil and Paraguay had life expectancy of below 30 in 1970 and almost 64 in 2010 That is a 35year increase in the average age of death in forty years Also important is the change outside Africa from communicable diseases to lifestyle diseases such as heart disease stroke diabetes and cancer That change is very obvious in Latin America the Middle East and southeast and even south Asia Murray said The third big result was he said a surprise to us The study showed that there are lots of people with disabilities and it has a big effect on people who are living longer but not healthier lives The main causes of disability are different from the ones that kill you he said They were mental health problems such as anxiety and depression disorders such as arthritis and lower back pain anaemia sight and hearing loss and skin disease Also there was drug abuse The number of people with these problems is not reducing over time he said We are making no progress in reducing these problems,A girl born today in the UK can expect to live nearly to the age of 82 on average while her brother will live to 78 They would have a longer life in Andorra 85 and 79 respectively but are marginally better off than in the US 81 and 76 while if they lived in the Central African Republic they would barely make it out of middle age 49 and 44 Nonetheless almost everywhere in the world with the exception of countries such as Lesotho which have been hit by HIV and violence lifespans are lengthening and the best news is that small children are substantially less likely to die than they were four decades ago There has been a drop in deaths among underfives of nearly 60 from 164 million in 1970 to 68 million in 2010 That in itself is justification for the enormous project that the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation IHME in Seattle has led over the past five years involving nearly 500 researchers to assess the global burden of disease Knowing how many children die and from what cause enables the world to focus its efforts and resources on keeping them alive There are many lessons to be gleaned from the vast database they have put together which will help global organizations and individual governments to better care for us all from a renewed focus on diet to tackling alcohol to keeping up the efforts against HIV in Africa The seven papers published by The Lancet represent a big undertaking and are not without controversy IHME has been ambitiously radical in some of its methods In the absence of death registries or medical records they have been willing for instance to take evidence from verbal autopsies deciding the cause of death by an interview with the family The most startling result has been the malaria figure released earlier in 2012 IHME said 12 million die of the disease every year twice as many as previously thought The big increase is in adult deaths Conventional wisdom has it that malaria kills mostly children under five The way I was taught as a doctor and everybody else is taught is that in malarial areas you become semiimmune as an adult said Dr Christopher Murray IHME Director and one of the founders of the Global Burden of Disease project We originally went with the prevailing opinion but there has been a shift as we have become more empirical African doctors write on hospital records that adults are dying of malaria a lot But he adds their fever could be something else The findings have prompted further studies Although Margaret Chan Director General of the World Health Organization gave the IHME study a warm official welcome some of the staff are cautious We need to be very careful in assessing the validity of the figures said Colin Mathers a senior scientist in the Evidence for Information and Policy Cluster We need to wait to be persuaded by evidence His colleague Dr Tiers Boerma Director of the WHO Department of Health Statistics and Informatics added People should understand that some of the numbers are very different and the WHO cant jump with any academic publication that states a different number However said Mathers the fact that IHME has pushed the envelope with some of these analyses is stimulating One of the main themes said Murray was incredibly rapid change in the leading causes of death and the pace of that change is a lot faster than we expected it to be Reduced fertility and longer life expectancies have meant a rise in the mean age of the worlds population in a decade from 26 years old to almost 30 It has been dramatic in Latin America for instance where countries like Brazil and Paraguay had life expectancy of below 30 in 1970 and almost 64 in 2010 That is a 35year increase in the mean age of death over four decades In a place like Brazil the speed of change is so fast that most institutions are illequipped to deal with it Murray said The second theme entwined with it is the shift outside Africa from communicable diseases and the common causes of mother and baby deaths to what are sometimes termed lifestyle diseases such as heart disease stroke diabetes and cancer some of which have significant genetic triggers That shift has been particularly marked in Latin America the Middle East and southeast and even south Asia he said The third big finding was Murray said a surprise to us That was the sheer extent of disability and the toll it took on people who were living longer but not healthier lives The main causes of disability are different from the ones that kill you he said They were mental health problems such as anxiety and depression musculoskeletal disorders such as arthritis and lower back pain complained of in every country in the world anaemia sight and hearing loss and skin disease In addition there was substance abuse The rates for these are not going down over time he said We are making no progress in reducing these conditions,test,ELE,ADV
83,The Chief Medical Officer for England compared the problem of antibiotic resistance to the risks of international terrorism But each year the number of deaths around the world from bacterial resistance is far more than the number of deaths from terrorist attacks The World Health Organization says that each year more than 150000 people die from tuberculosis because of antibiotic resistance This is now a war A hundred years ago life expectancy in the UK was about 47 years for a man and 50 years for a woman Lots of young children died About 30 of all deaths were in children under the age of five mostly because of infectious disease But a child born in Britain today has more than a 25 chance of reaching their 100th birthday We can thank public health systems vaccination and antibiotics for this In intensive care antibiotic resistant bacteria are most common Here powerful antibiotics are used very often These drugs kill ordinary bacteria But they cannot kill strong bacteria that have begun to learn how to survive antibiotic drugs When I became a doctor in the 1990s I learnt about Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus MRSA is a bacteria that is resistant to methicillin and all other penicillins There were just a few drugs that could kill it for example vancomycin and teicoplanin But antibiotic resistant bacteria became more and more common In our hospitals and our doctors surgeries we use antiobiotics too often Also we have put antibiotics into the food chain when we grow food and when we put antibacterial drugs into food for farm animals We thought that antibiotics were something we could use forever We thought that companies would continue to make more and more antibiotics But this is no longer true We have found new more resistant bacteria The vancomycin that we used to treat MRSA infection no longer worked We found Vancomycin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus VRSA in our hospitals And other bacteria were becoming resistant too Today infections with organisms that are very resistant are common but fewer and fewer new antibiotic drugs are made It is more and more difficult to develop new drugs that can kill resistant bacteria Antibiotics have become drugs that are expensive to develop that are only used in short courses and that quickly stop working because of bacterial resistance This war against bacteria is different from all other wars There needs to be change in the way doctors give antibiotics and we need to use fewer antibiotics in farming And we have to give companies good reasons why they should make new antibiotics which will not make them lots of money Today antibiotic resistance has become a normal part of life Less than a hundred years after the discovery of penicillin we are beginning to lose the fight,Dame Sally Davies the Chief Medical Officer for England has likened the problem of antibiotic resistance to the risks presented by international terrorism While this might sound like an exaggeration the threat was actually if anything understated Each year the global number of deaths to which bacterial resistance contributes far outstrips those caused by terrorist attacks While it is difficult to track the global impact of antibiotic resistance across all bacterial species the World Health Organization estimates that for tuberculosis alone multidrug resistance accounts for more than 150000 deaths each year Antibiotic resistance is no longer an abstract risk this is now a war In the past hundred years our expectations of life and survival have changed beyond all recognition At the beginning of the twentieth century life expectancy in the UK stood at around 47 years of age for a man and 50 for a woman a number heavily affected by the very high rate of infant mortality in those days Around a third of all deaths occurred in children under the age of five largely because of infectious disease In contrast a child born in Britain today has a better than one in four chance of reaching their 100th birthday For this we have public health systems vaccination and antibiotics to thank It is by these means the prevention and treatment of illnesses caused by microorganisms that the real war against disease is principally won Elsewhere we have pushed the limits of survival notably in intensive care This the specialism in which I chose to train is where antibiotic resistant organisms are most prevalent Here powerful antibiotics essential in the treatment of lifethreatening illness are used routinely These drugs decimate ordinary bacteria But what they leave behind are hardy species that have begun to learn tricks that allow them to evade antibiotic drugs As a newly qualified doctor in the late 1990s I learnt about Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus the infamous MRSA a bacterial species resistant to methicillin and all other penicillins In the fight against it there were a handful of exoticsounding drugs vancomycin and teicoplanin among them These were supposed to be our last lines of defence but antibiotic resistant bacteria became more and more common as did species with new patterns of resistance Drugs we had previously barely heard of became commonplace New lastline drugs emerged to replace the old We got used to this state of affairs a steady escalation in the arms race between us and the bacteria But the balance has been shifting steadily In our hospitals and our GP surgeries we have abused the drugs that gave us such a huge advantage over infectious disease using them too often and too indiscriminately And some of the worst abuses have occurred outside of healthcare with antibiotics introduced into the food chain through agriculture and the lacing of livestock feed with antibacterial drugs We assumed that antibiotic therapy was an advantage we could enjoy forever We became complacent that the pharmaceutical industry would continue to stay ahead of the game But this is no longer the case New more resistant species have been identified The vancomycin that we used to rely on to treat MRSA infection was defeated Vancomycin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus VRSA emerged in our hospitals And other bacterial species were learning the same trick Enterobacteria organisms usually found in the gut had also acquired vancomycin resistance Today infections with formidable highly resistant organisms are commonplace and the pharmaceutical industry is not keeping pace Fewer and fewer new antimicrobial drugs are emerging from their production lines It is becoming increasingly difficult to develop new drugs active against resistant strains For every method of attack the pharmaceutical companies invent bacteria rapidly evolve a defence All of the simple approaches to the problem have been exhausted Antibiotics have become drugs that are expensive to develop that are only used in short courses and that quickly become ineffective due to the evolution of bacterial resistance Consequently the pharmaceutical industrys incentive to manufacture new drugs that can fight them is low Almost as soon as antibiotic use became widespread in the 1940s the first evidence of bacteria resistance to antimicrobial therapy emerged Initially these were little more than curiosities When they did infect patients the numbers were so small that at first they were not enough to warrant much attention But today they have become a fact of medical life Less than a century after the discovery of penicillin we are beginning to lose the fight Since the first MRSA deaths in otherwise healthy children in the US in 1998 the number of deaths from MRSA infection in the US each year has risen to tens of thousands outstripping the number of deaths caused by AIDS Bacterial resistance in hospitals is everywhere you look This is a war like no other There needs to be cultural change in our prescribing behaviours and more restraint in the use of antibiotics in farming and agriculture And somehow the pharmaceutical companies have to be convinced to chase the development of these less profitable drugs Within my working lifetime the pattern of antibiotic resistance in healthcare has transformed from a rare but notable event to a problem of epidemic proportion If we are to avoid a return to the preantibiotic time with all its excess mortality we must be bold To squander the advantage we have so recently gained against microorganisms in the fight for life would be unthinkable,test,ELE,ADV
184,The huge fortunes made by the worlds richest 100 billionaires are making inequality worse and stopping the world from being able to reduce poverty says Oxfam Oxfam said the world could end poverty several times over if the richest 100 billionaires would give away the money they made in 2012 The charity said that the 240bn made in 2012 by the richest 100 billionaires would be enough to end extreme poverty four times over It is unusual for charities to attack the wealthy because they are usually seen as a source of money Bill Gates and Warren Buffett are among a group of 40 US billionaires who have said they will give much of their money to aid projects but there is little information about how much money they give each year Russian Middle Eastern and Chinese billionaires do not give away money to charity in the same way that US billionaires do In the report the charity asks world leaders to end income extremes and reduce inequality The report said that the richest 1 of people have increased their incomes by 60 in the past 20 years Barbara Stocking Oxfams Chief Executive said We can no longer pretend that wealth for a few people will benefit many people too often the opposite is true The report said the problem affected all parts of the world In the UK inequality is returning to levels not seen since the nineteenth century In China the top 10 now earn nearly 60 of the income Chinese inequality levels are now similar to those in South Africa which is now the most unequal country on Earth In the US the share of national income that goes to the top 1 of people has doubled since 1980 from 10 to 20 the report says The richest 1 are estimated to cause 10000 times more pollution than the average US citizen Oxfam said world leaders should learn from countries such as Brazil which has grown quickly and reduced inequality at the same time Stocking said that world leaders should agree to reduce inequality to the levels seen in 1990 She said closing tax havens which hold as much as 31 trillion or as much as a third of all global wealth could collect 189bn in additional taxes,The vast fortunes made by the worlds richest 100 billionaires are driving up inequality and hindering the worlds ability to tackle poverty according to Oxfam The charity said the accumulation of wealth and income on an unprecedented scale often at the expense of secure jobs and decent wages for the poorest undermined the ability of people who survive on aid or low wages to improve their situation and escape poverty Oxfam said the worlds poorest could be lifted out of poverty several times over if the richest 100 billionaires would give away the money they made in 2012 Without pointing a finger at individuals the charity argued that the 240bn net income amassed in 2012 by the richest 100 billionaires would be enough to make extreme poverty history four times over It is rare for charities to attack the wealthy who are usually regarded as a source of funding Bill Gates and Warren Buffett are among a group of 40 US billionaires who have pledged much of their wealth to aid projects but there is little detail about the level of their annual donations Their actions have also not been matched by Russian Middle Eastern or Chinese billionaires In the report The Cost of Inequality How Wealth and Income Extremes Hurt Us All published just before the World Economic Forum in Davos the charity calls on world leaders to curb income extremes and commit to reducing inequality to at least 1990 levels The report found that the richest 1 had increased their incomes by 60 in the past 20 years with the financial crisis accelerating rather than slowing the process Barbara Stocking Oxfams Chief Executive said extreme wealth was economically inefficient politically corrosive socially divisive and environmentally destructive She said studies show that countries suffer low levels of investment and growth as workers are forced to survive on a smaller share of total incomes She said We can no longer pretend that the creation of wealth for a few will inevitably benefit the many too often the reverse is true The report said the issue affected all parts of the world In the UK inequality is rapidly returning to levels not seen since the time of Charles Dickens the nineteenthcentury novelist In China the top 10 now take home nearly 60 of the income Chinese inequality levels are now similar to those in South Africa which is now the most unequal country on Earth and significantly more unequal than at the end of apartheid In the US the share of national income going to the top 1 has doubled since 1980 from 10 to 20 the report says For the top 001 the share of national income is above levels last seen in the 1920s The World Bank and International Monetary Fund have argued that extreme income inequality undermines growth and both organizations have attempted to tie their loans to programmes that limit the growth of inequality Members of the richest 1 are estimated to use as much as 10000 times more carbon than the average US citizen Oxfam said world leaders should learn from countries such as Brazil which has grown rapidly while reducing inequality Stocking said We need a global new deal to reverse decades of increasing inequality As a first step world leaders should formally commit themselves to reducing inequality to the levels seen in 1990 She said closing tax havens which the Tax Justice Network says hold as much as 31 trillion or as much as a third of all global wealth could yield 189bn in additional tax

138,Our new international survey including 33 countries shows how wrong people around the world are about some important things British people think the richest 1 own 59 of their countrys wealth when they actually only own 23 Americans think that 33 of their population are immigrants but it is really only 14 Brazilians think the average age in their country is 56 when it is only 31 Russians think that 31 of their politicians are women when it is only 14 In Britain people think that 43 of young adults aged 2534 still live at home with their parents rather than the actual 14 In India people who did the online survey think 60 of the whole country also has internet access when really only 19 do So why do people across the world know so little about these things Some of us dont understand the questions For example most countries overestimate how many people are not religious in the 33 countries people thought 37 are not religious but the real number is actually just 18 This is because we are thinking of how many people practise their religion rather than how many people say they have a religion Rural areas are large so that is why people overestimate how many people live in the countryside We see things from our own perspective and nd it dif cult to imagine that there is a lot of variety in our countries For example the people from India who did the survey really overestimated their populations access to the internet Most people did the study online and in developing countries this means the people who did the survey were probably wealthy What we found from the survey is that people generalize from their own situations and forget that other peoples situations might be different In Britain this is probably the reason why people overestimated how much the richest people own how many young people are still living at home and what proportion of the population are immigrants the guess is 25 when it is really only 13 People are worried about these things and because of this they overestimate But the survey suggests there are also some problems that people are not very worried about but they should be more worried For example most countries really underestimate how much of their population is overweight The worst case is Saudi Arabia where people think only 28 are overweight when 71 are Britons think it is 44 when actually 62 are overweight In many ways it is the differences between countries that are the most interesting and important aspects of the study The top 1 in Russia own 70 of the nations wealth while the top 1 in New Zealand only own 18 Half of Italians aged 2534 still live with their parents but only 4 in Norway The average age in India is 27 it is 47 in Japan Only 10 of politicians are women in Brazil Hungary and Japan when 44 are in Sweden When the reality is so strange and varied it is not surprising that were often so wrong,Our new international survey across 33 countries shows just how wrong the world is about a range of key social realities British people think the top 1 wealthiest households own 59 of their countrys wealth when they actually only own 23 Americans think that 33 of their population are immigrants when in fact it is only 14 Brazilians think the average age in their country is 56 when it is only 31 Russians think that 31 of their politicians are women when it is only 14 In Britain people think that an extraordinary 43 of young adults aged 2534 still live at home with their parents rather than the actual 14 In India the online population think 60 of the whole country also has internet access when in fact only 19 do Why are people across the world so often so clueless about these realities It is partly that we just struggle with basic maths and some of us clearly misunderstand the questions or interpret them differently For example most countries hugely overestimate how many people do not af liate themselves with a religion across the 33 countries 37 do not according to respondents but the average is actually just 18 This will be partly because we will be thinking of how many people practise their religion rather than what they put on census forms People also take mental shortcuts where they grab for easily available information even if it doesnt quite t the question Our huge overestimates of the rural populations in most countries will be affected by how much of the physical landmass rural areas make up rather than a careful calculation of how unoccupied it generally is In Daniel Kahnemans terms answers to these sorts of questions are classic examples of fast thinking rather than slow We are tied to our own perspective and struggle to imagine the variety in our countries as highlighted by our Indian samples massively overestimating their populations access to the internet Our study was mostly carried out through an online survey and in developing countries this will be representative of a more af uent connected group rather than the population as a whole In some ways we may have expected this more educated sample to get closer to reality those with higher education levels tend to be more accurate on these types of questions But what we nd throughout the study is that people grossly generalize from their own situations forgetting how unrepresentative they are We suffer from what social psychologists call emotional innumeracy when estimating realities this means we are sending a message about what is worrying us as much as trying to get the right answers Cause and effect run both ways with our concern leading to our misperceptions as much as our misperceptions creating our concern For Britain this is likely to be part of the explanation for peoples huge overestimates of how much the wealthiest own how many young people are still living at home and what proportion of the population are immigrants the guess is 25 when it is really only 13 according to of cial estimates People are worried about the concentration of wealth the housing pressures facing young people and immigration levels and this is re ected in them overstating the scale of the issues But the survey suggests there are also some issues where people are not as worried as they should be For example most countries hugely underestimate how much of their population is overweight or obese The worst case is Saudi Arabia where people think only 28 are when 71 are Britons think it is 44 when it is actually nearly half as much again 62 are either overweight or obese And in many ways it is not our misperceptions but these realities across different countries that are the most interesting and important aspects of the study The top 1 in Russia own 70 of the nations wealth while the top 1 in New Zealand only own 18 Half of Italians aged 2534 still live with their parents when it is only 4 in Norway The average age in India is 27 it is 47 in Japan Only 10 of politicians are women in Brazil Hungary and Japan when 44 are in Sweden When the reality is so strange and varied it is no wonder were so wrong,test,ELE,ADV
