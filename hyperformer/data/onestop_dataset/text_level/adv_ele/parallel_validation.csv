146,Illegal downloading is a kind of moral squalor and theft as much as reaching in to someones pocket and stealing their wallet is theft says author Philip Pullman In an article for Index on Censorship Pullman who is president of the Society of Authors makes a robust defence of copyright laws He is highly critical of internet users who think it is OK to download music or books without paying for them The technical brilliance is so dazzling that people cant see the moral squalor of what theyre doing he writes It is outrageous that anyone can steal an artists work and get away with it It is theft as surely as reaching into someones pocket and taking their wallet is theft His article comes after music industry leaders met British Prime Minister David Cameron in Downing Street where the issue of web piracy was discussed Pullman writer of the His Dark Materials trilogy says authors and musicians work in poverty and obscurity for years to bring their work to the level that gives delight to their audiences and as soon as they achieve that the possibility of making a living from it is taken away from them He concludes The principle is simple and unaltered by technology science or magic if we want to enjoy the work that someone does we should pay for it Pullman is writing in the next issue of the campaign groups magazine in a dialogue with Cathy Casserly chief executive of Creative Commons which offers open content licences that lets creators take copyright into their own hands Casserly argues that there is much wrong with copyright which was created in an analogue age She writes By default copyright closes the door on countless ways that people can share build upon and remix each others work possibilities that were unimaginable when those laws were established She says artists need to think creatively about how they distribute and monetize their work quoting the science fiction writer Cory Doctorow who said My problem is not piracy its obscurity Index on Censorship agrees The magazines editor Rachael Jolley said Existing copyright laws dont work in the digital age and risk criminalizing consumers We need new models for how artists writers and musicians earn a living from their work The debate is a lively one and the scale of illegal downloading vast Data collected by Ofcom the independent regulator and competition authority for the UK communications industries suggests that between November 2012 and January 2013 in the UK 280 million music tracks were digitally pirated along with 52 million TV shows 29 million films 18 million ebooks and 7 million software or games files Ofcom has said 18 of internet users aged over 12 admit to having recently pirated content and 9 say they fear getting caught Pullman writes in his article The ease and swiftness with which music can be acquired in the form of MP3 downloads is still astonishing to those of us who have been building up our iTunes list for some time One thing to emerge from the Downing Street meeting was Camerons appointment of the Conservative MP Mike Weatherley to be his adviser on the subject A spokesman for the BPI the record industry trade body said Mike Weatherley is a strong champion of copyright and the artists and creative producers its there to protect We hope his influence and the prime ministers endorsement of copyright will be brought to bear on the approach of the UKs intellectual property office,Illegal downloading is morally wrong and it is theft the same as putting your hand in someones pocket and stealing their wallet is theft says

Pullman is writing in the next issue of the campaign groups magazine in a dialogue with Cathy Casserly chief executive of Creative Commons Casserly argues that there is a lot wrong with copyright

laws were made She says artists need to think creatively about how they earn money from their work Index on Censorship agrees The magazines editor Rachael Jolley said Existing copyright laws dont work

58,Back in 2010 the old city in Srinagar was the sort of place police would only venture into wearing body armour A stronghold for violent separatists agitating for an independent Kashmir it was at the centre of uprisings that left more than 100 people dead buried along with dreams of peace in the mountainous northIndian region How quickly things change Now carefree tourists line up in the same streets for barbecued mutton tikka and steaming plates of rogan josh The Nowhatta mosque where in the summer of 2010 youths would gather after Friday prayers to throw stones at the security forces is to become part of an official walking tour focused on heritage crafts and markets Down by Dal Lake houseboats have been booked out months in advance In the stunning gardens lining the lakes green slopes visitors can have their picture taken against one of Asias prettiest backdrops Until the snow melted the nearby ski resorts were packed with rich Russians too In 2002 only just over 27000 tourists dared to visit the Kashmir Valley frightened off by the antiIndian insurgency which has claimed up to 70000 lives So far in 2012 the area has received almost one million holidaymakers more than 23000 of them from outside India But fewer than 150 Britons were among them largely because the UKs Foreign Office refuses to amend its somewhat hairraising advice which deters most travellers by providing a list of recent security incidents in the region Omar Abdullah the UKborn Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir has lobbied the British High Commission in Delhi to relax the guidelines but to no avail Its a source of frustration admitted Abdullah who has been in charge of Indias most sensitive state since the start of 2009 Today unfortunately as a result of that travel advisory peoples insurance is null and void when they visit here The last publicized case of foreign tourists being murdered in JK was in 1995 when six westerners including two Britons were kidnapped by AlFaran a Kashmiri militant Islamist group Only one escaped with his life Youve had British citizens killed more recently in countries that you still havent stopped people from visiting I mean how many British citizens did you lose in 911 Did you stop people from visiting New York Youve lost them in Spain in Bali tell me where you havent lost them said Abdullah Weve lost Indians in London There is still a possibility that alQaida could do something stupid like they have done in the past but we havent stopped Indians from travelling to London There is no reason to single out Jammu and Kashmir or even Srinagar as an unsafe destination Germany relaxed its guidelines for those thinking of travelling to the region in 2011 Foreigners are generally not direct targets of clashes counselled Germanys amended advice At the time it was viewed by many outsiders as a bold move coming less than a year after the 2010 disturbances finally died down A nationwide holiday on 15 August marked 65 years of Indian independence in the past a day fraught with peril in a state where many do not feel part of the worlds biggest democracy But this time at the independence celebrations there was no trouble Abdullah insists tourists are safe in the state as long as you take the sort of precautions that one normally would In other words do not go trekking near the border that separates the Indian and Pakistani controlled parts of JK Syed Ali Shah Geelani leader of the proKashmiri independence party disagrees bitterly with much of Abdullahs politics But on the issue of tourism the two are united At the start of the summer season Geelani wrote an open letter to tourists and pilgrims that said Whatever your faith whatever language you speak and to whatever region you belong we are bound by a common bond the bond of humanity You are our honoured guest respecting and protecting guests is not only our moral obligation but an article of faith Some visitors may worry about the ethics of having fun in a place with a population suffering from record levels of anxiety and mental health problems But all the locals we spoke to in Srinagar were wholeheartedly in favour of tourism Amjid Gulzar 26 said Abdullah could search for truth and reconciliation as well as encouraging foreign visitors He must do both but without tourism our economy will be in chaos he said adding that while he welcomed the million tourists who visited this year Kashmir had to do more to attract bigspending visitors especially foreigners We need better infrastructure better roads reliable electricity We need more for tourists to do in the evening we dont even have one cinema in this city and there isnt enough for tourists to do after dark he said But will tourists feel welcome In June a local Islamic group issued a dress code for foreign tourists Abdullah sighs at the mention of that furore Nobody expects tourists to come here and cover their faces I think what they were talking about was short shorts and sleeveless vests which even then would not be something that would attract too much attention I think the basic point they were making was be sensitive to our cultural identity and dress appropriately I think thats common sense Abdullah said he was on a tourism drive for no other reason than the fact that I need to stimulate the economy JKs finances are in a dire state after more than two decades of turmoil The state receives just 72m each year in taxes and yet the salary bill for the 500000 public employees is 155m he said It is clear why he needs to find more funds fast For now though he is just cautiously pleased to see tourists back Im not suggesting that because weve had one million tourists here that its a sign of normality he said But it gives me some satisfaction that people can come have a nice time and go back,In 2010 it was too dangerous for the police to enter the old part of the city of Srinagar in India Violent separatists were fighting for an independent Kashmir and they had killed more than 100 people there But things change very quickly The same streets are now full of tourists The mosque where young people threw stones at the security forces will soon be part of an official walking tour Visitors can take photos in the beautiful gardens by the lake During the winter the nearby ski resorts were full of rich Russians In 2002 only 27000 tourists came to visit the Kashmir Valley Others were scared because of the antiIndian fighting almost 70000 people have died during the fighting So far in 2012 almost one million people have visited the area this includes more than 23000 from outside India But fewer than 150 Britons visited mainly because the UK governments advice is that the area is too dangerous to visit Omar Abdullah the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir has asked the British government to change its advice but they havent changed it Its frustrating says Abdullah Today because of that travel advice peoples insurance isnt valid when they visit here 1995 was the last time foreign tourists were murdered in Kashmir when an Islamist group kidnapped six westerners and killed five of them British citizens have been killed more recently in other countries I mean how many British citizens were killed on 911 Did you stop people from visiting New York Youve lost them in Spain in Bali said Abdullah Weve lost Indians in London There is still a possibility that alQaida could do something stupid but we havent stopped Indians from travelling to London There is no reason to say Kashmir or even Srinagar is a dangerous destination Germany changed its guidelines for travellers to the region in 2011 Foreigners are usually not direct targets the new guidelines said less than a year after the fighting in 2010 A national holiday on 15 August celebrated 65 years of Indian independence in the past this was a dangerous day because many people in the state do not feel part of India But there was no trouble at the independence celebrations on Wednesday Abdullah says tourists are safe in Kashmir if they are careful In other words do not go trekking near the border that separates the Indian and Pakistani parts of Kashmir Some visitors may feel it is not right to have fun in a place where local people have very high levels of anxiety and lots of mental health problems But the local people in Srinagar like tourism Amjid Gulzar 26 said Abdullah should encourage foreign visitors Without tourism our economy will be in chaos he said We need better roads reliable electricity We need more things for tourists to do in the evening we dont even have one cinema in this city he said But will tourists feel welcome In June a local Islamic group wrote a dress code for foreign tourists Abdullah says Nobody wants tourists to come here and cover their faces But they should be sensitive to our cultural identity and dress appropriately I think thats common sense Abdullah said tourism would help the economy Kashmirs economy is weak after more than twenty years of fighting The state receives just 72 million each year in taxes but it pays 155 million in salaries to 500000 public employees It is clear why he needs to find more money He is pleased to see tourists back Im not saying that one million tourists here shows that everything is normal again he said But it gives me some satisfaction that people can come have a nice time and

50,The beginning of the year is probably primetime for feeling glum about work its ages until the next holiday and its dark in the morning and when you get home And if youre stuck in a job you dont like it could be enough to have you reaching for your CV But before you start hunting through the job ads try to put things in perspective So what else could you be doing instead We asked fi ve people doing some unusual jobs how much they are paid what the worst parts are and why they enjoy their work 1 Dogfood taster The job Tasting dog food to make sure it meets a premium brands quality standards What it involves Opening sample tins of each freshly made batch of dog or cat food smelling it and eating it Although dogs palates are different from ours taste is an important quality check to ensure each different ingredient is perfectly balanced in just the right way says Philip Wells the chief taster for Lilys Kitchen pet food Trying the food is also a good way to pick up on the nuances of the cooking this works especially well on the dry food Typical salary 20000 for an entrylevel job in the quality department However Wells says 50000 or more is easily achievable for an experienced technical director who as well as tasting products is also likely to be responsible for developing new recipes and advising the business on technical and regulatory matters Worst part of the job The deadlines for Wells who admits he quite likes the food The meat used in pet food has to be derived from animals passed as fi t for human consumption under the Animal Feed Regulations 2010 and he says the fi rm uses humangrade freshly prepared raw food in its recipes He adds There are some pretty gruesome pet foods out there and although I dont taste them the smell is enough to turn the stomach when I do a bit of market research Job satisfaction No two days are ever the same Its rewarding Wells says that a project he has worked on will help pets to become happier and healthier However he acknowledges that some of the credit must go to another key member of the tasting team Lily the border terrier 2 Hygiene technician The job Disinfecting areas that have potentially been exposed to biohazardous situations What it involves Cleaning up crime scenes road accidents and suicides Clearing hoarders houses full of rubbish rats and excrement among other things The job is about keeping people safe says Richard Lewis a hygiene technician for Rentokil We deal with some very disturbingly dirty sites Typical salary The entrylevel salary is usually around 14500 and a top salary can be up to 22000 Worst part of the job Cleaning up after suicides You get used to the job being disgusting but the emotional side of it is still hard You learn not to take your work home with you he says You also need to have a sense of humour as some days can be tough Job satisfaction Lewis fi nds the variety of tasks exciting One day Im cleaning up after a dead body another day Im in a prison cell or 100 feet in the air being lowered down into a silo to clean it He also takes pride in the transformation he brings about Its satisfying to return a potentially hazardous site back to a safe environment And it benefi ts society 3 Biogas engineer The job Setting up biogas plants in developing countries What it involves Linking a system of digesters which can be fi lled with human excrement animal dung and other waste products to toilets to produce a biogas that can be used for cooking and lighting You have to know what size and shape the mixing pit needs to be how to create the optimum temperature for digestion and where to situate the biogas plant says Baburam Paudel chief technical offi cer in Nepal for the charity Renewable World You also have to convince poor communities that poo can be productive many are repelled by the idea of connecting their toilets to their kitchens Typical salary An entrylevel salary is around 10000 while a typical salary for a chief technical offi cer is 30000 Worst part of the job For Paudel its seeing people struggling to survive on very little income But he admits anyone who wont change a nappy would struggle You have to be willing to get your hands dirty during the build process and inspections Unsurprisingly the anaerobic digestion the process that takes place when bacteria eat the decomposing waste and produce methane smells like rotten eggs It can be disgusting and there is no room for mistakes Job satisfaction I fi nd it immensely satisfying to know that I am helping people to increase their incomes and allowing girls to attend school by replacing the need to collect fi rewood says Paudel My work improves the health and hygiene of whole communities 4 Eel ecologist The job Conserving the critically endangered European eel What it involves To monitor the size of the endangered eels ecologists wade into the Thames and other London rivers and marshes full of eels sometimes up to their armpits and reach into a net fi lled with up to 20 adult eels to grab one with their bare hands Adult eels can be a metre long or even larger and weigh up to 2kg Theyre not at all dangerous but they are almost pure muscle and they can be a little bit slimy says Stephen Mowat an eel conservationist and ecologist for the Zoological Society of London We have to weigh and measure them and they wriggle a lot Its diffi cult to look professional while crawling on the ground chasing an eel across the grass Worst part of the job Eels are really tricky creatures to work with and getting outsmarted by an eel can be quite embarrassing says Mowat You also have to be ready to jump from one project to the next I once had to dissect a tub of dead eels to examine parasites living in them moments before jumping into a suit for a meeting with government offi cials I remembered to wash my hands But for Mowat the worst part of the job is defi nitely not handling the eels he believes baby eels known as elvers are as cute as pandas The worst thing about the job is regularly learning how much damage we the British population are doing to the environment Job satisfaction Getting to work outdoors and seeing British wildlife up close is the best part of the job says Mowat Eels are beautiful creatures and working with eels doesnt just benefi t the eel it helps whole river systems estuaries and coastal habitats That is something worth working on 5 Shopping channel presenter The job Selling and demonstrating a wide range of products on live TV What it involves Presenting hours and hours of monotonous content while simultaneously demonstrating the products and appearing to be enthusiastic and knowledgeable about everything that youre selling I prepare and research as much technical and practical information as possible on every single product beforehand says Shaun Ryan presenter for Ideal World TV But you also need the ability to relate to every genre of products and to every viewer Typical salary A trainee presenter would start on a minimum of 30000 while an experienced presenter can expect over 55000 Worst part of the job The unsociable hours says Ryan An experienced presenter like myself generally gets to work primetime hours which means all weekends bank holidays and very late evenings plus the occasional 5am shift His worst task ever he says was singlehandedly having to sell some female slimming pants It was a very tricky hour and not my fi nest Job satisfaction I love the rush of live presenting and having to think on my feet every second says Ryan I also get an adrenaline rush from knowing that at times I have thousands of viewers ordering the product that I have just been presenting,We talked to five people who do some unusual jobs about how much they are paid what the worst parts are and why they enjoy their work 1 Dogfood taster The job To taste dog food to make sure it is good quality What this person does Opens tins of dog or cat food smells it and eats it Tasting is an important quality check to make sure each different ingredient is perfectly balanced says Philip Wells the chief taster for Lilys Kitchen pet food Typical salary 20000 for a job in the quality department Worst part of the job The deadlines Wells says he likes the food The meat in pet food must come from animals that humans can safely eat He also says There are some terrible pet foods I dont taste them but just the smell makes you feel sick Job satisfaction Every day is different Wells likes knowing that he helps pets to become happier and healthier But he says that someone else in the tasting team is also a very important member Lily the dog 2 Hygiene technician The job To clean areas that might be dangerous to humans What this person does Cleans up crime scenes road accidents and suicides Clears houses full of rubbish rats and excrement and other things too The job is to keep people safe says Richard Lewis a hygiene technician for Rentokil We work in some very very dirty places Typical salary

poor people produce biogas from their excrement and other waste products This is done by linking a system to toilets Poor people can use the gas for cooking and lighting Typical salary When you start the salary is around 10000 A typical salary for a chief technical officer is 30000 Worst part of the job For Baburam Paudel chief technical officer in Nepal for the charity Renewable World the worst part is seeing people struggling to survive on very little money Unsurprisingly the smell of the waste products can be disgusting It smells like rotten eggs Job satisfaction I find it very satisfying to know that I am helping people to earn more money and also allowing girls to go to school because they dont need to collect firewood says Paudel My work improves the health and hygiene of whole communities 4 Eel ecologist The job To help the critically endangered European eel to survive What this person does Checks the size of the endangered eels They do this by walking into the Thames and other London rivers which are full of eels In the rivers they put their hands into a net filled with up to 20 adult eels and pull an eel out Adult eels can be a metre long or even larger and weigh up to 2kg Theyre not dangerous but they are almost 100 muscle and they can be a little bit slimy says Stephen Mowat an eel ecologist for the Zoological Society of London We have to weigh and measure them

156,Temperature rises resulting from unchecked climate change will be at the severe end of those projected according to a new scientific study The scientist leading the research said that unless emissions of greenhouse gases were cut the planet would heat up by a minimum of 4C by 2100 twice the level the worlds governments deem dangerous The research indicates that fewer clouds form as the planet warms meaning less sunlight is reflected back into space driving temperatures up further still The way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery surrounding future climate change Professor Steven Sherwood at the University of New South Wales in Australia who led the new work said This study breaks new ground twice first by identifying what is controlling the cloud changes and second by strongly discounting the lowest estimates of future global warming in favour of the higher and more damaging estimates 4C would likely be catastrophic rather than simply dangerous Sherwood said For example it would make life difficult if not impossible in much of the tropics and would guarantee the eventual melting of the Greenland ice sheet and some of the Antarctic ice sheet with sea levels rising by many metres as a result The research is a big advance that halves the uncertainty about how much warming is caused by rises in carbon emissions according to scientists commenting on the study published in the journal Nature Hideo Shiogama and Tomoo Ogura at Japans National Institute for Environmental Studies said the explanation of how fewer clouds form as the world warms was convincing and agreed this indicated future climate change would be greater than expected But they said more challenges lay ahead to narrow down further the projections of future temperatures Scientists measure the sensitivity of the Earths climate to greenhouse gases by estimating the temperature rise that would be caused by a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere compared with preindustrial levels as is likely to happen within 50 years on current trends For two decades those estimates have run from 15C to 5C a wide range The new research narrowed that range to between 3C and 5C by closely examining the biggest cause of uncertainty clouds The key was to ensure that the way clouds form in the real world was accurately represented in computer climate models which are the only tool researchers have to predict future temperatures When water evaporates from the oceans the vapour can rise over nine miles to form rain clouds that reflect sunlight or it may rise just a few miles and drift back down without forming clouds In reality both processes occur and climate models encompassing this complexity predicted significantly higher future temperatures than those only including the ninemilehigh clouds Climate sceptics like to criticize climate models for getting things wrong and we are the first to admit they are not perfect said Sherwood But what we are finding is that the mistakes are being made by the models which predict less warming not those that predict more He added Sceptics may also point to the hiatus of temperatures since the end of the 20th century but there is increasing evidence that this inaptly named hiatus is not seen in other measures of the climate system and is almost certainly temporary Global average air temperatures have increased relatively slowly since a high point in 1998 caused by the ocean phenomenon El Nino but observations show that heat is continuing to be trapped in increasing amounts by greenhouse gases with over 90 disappearing into the oceans Furthermore a study in November 2013 suggested the pause may be largely an illusion resulting from the lack of temperature readings from polar regions where warming is greatest Sherwood accepts his teams work on the role of clouds cannot definitively rule out that future temperature rises will lie at the lower end of projections But he said for that to be the case one would need to invoke some new dimension to the problem involving a major missing ingredient for which we currently have no evidence Such a thing is not out of the question but requires a lot of faith He added Rises in global average temperatures of at least 4C by 2100 will have profound impacts on the world and the economies of many countries if we dont urgently start to curb our emissions,A new scientific study says that global warming might make temperatures rise more than people think The scientist who led the research said that if emissions of greenhouse gases are not reduced the planet will be at least 4C warmer by 2100 This is twice the level the worlds governments consider to be dangerous The research shows that fewer clouds form as the planet warms This means that less sunlight reflects back into space and this makes temperatures even higher The way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery in the study of future climate change Professor Steven Sherwood at the University of New South Wales in Australia who led the research said that their work was new in two ways First it found what controls the cloud changes and second it did not accept the lowest estimates of future global warming it believed the higher more damaging estimates 4C would be catastrophic not simply dangerous Sherwood said For example it would make life difficult if not impossible in much of the tropics and it would guarantee the eventual melting of the Greenland ice sheet and some of the Antarctic ice sheet And if the ice sheets melt sea levels will rise by many metres The research helps to show how much warming is caused by rises in carbon emissions say scientists who have commented on the study published in the journal Nature Experts at Japans National Institute for Environmental Studies said the explanation of how fewer clouds form as the world warms was a good one They also agreed that this showed future climate change would be bigger than people think To measure the effect of greenhouse gases on the Earths climate scientists estimate what the rise in temperature would be with twice as much CO2 in the atmosphere as in the preindustrial age and this will probably happen within 50 years For twenty years those estimates have been from 15C to 5C a wide range The new research has reduced that range to between 3C and 5C by studying the biggest cause of uncertainty clouds Researchers use computer climate models to predict future temperatures and it was important to include the way clouds form in those models When water evaporates from the oceans the vapour can rise over nine miles to form rain clouds that reflect sunlight or it may rise just a few miles and fall slowly back down without forming clouds In reality both things happen and climate models that include the second possibility predict much higher future temperatures than the models that only include the ninemilehigh clouds Climate sceptics like to criticize climate models because they are sometimes wrong and we know that they are not perfect said Sherwood But we are finding that the mistakes are being made by the models that predict less warming not the models that predict more warming He added Sceptics may also point to the pause in the rise of temperatures since the end of the 20th century but there is more and more evidence that we cannot see this pause in other measures of the climate system And the pause is almost certainly temporary The worlds average air temperatures have increased quite slowly since a high point in 1998 which the ocean phenomenon El Nino caused But greenhouse gases are trapping more and more heat and over 90 disappears into the oceans Also a recent study suggested that it may seem there is a pause but this is only because we did not have temperature readings from polar regions where there is the most warming Sherwood accepts that his teams work on the role of clouds does not mean for sure that temperature rises will be in the higher range He added that a 4C rise in the worlds average temperatures would have a serious effect on the world and the economies of many countries if we do not reduce

49,David Mitchell a regular contender for the Man Booker literary prize is used to his novels being picked over by the critics So its something of a relief says the British author that his latest work completed at 1am one Tuesday morning before a car arrived to take him to the airport to catch a flight to Norway wont be seen by anyone until 2114 Mitchell is the second contributor to the Scottish artist Katie Patersons Future Library project for which 1000 trees were planted in 2014 in Oslos Nordmarka forest Starting with Margaret Atwood who handed over the manuscript of a text called Scribbler Moon in 2015 each year for the next 100 years an author will deliver a piece of writing that will only be read in 2114 when the trees are chopped down to make paper on which the 100 texts will be printed Each author their names revealed year by year and chosen by a panel of experts and Paterson while she is alive will make the trek to the spot in the forest high above Oslo where they will surrender their manuscripts in a short ceremony Its a little glimmer of hope in a season of highly depressing news cycles which affirms we are in with a chance of civilization in a hundred years said Mitchell Everything is telling us that were doomed but the Future Library is a candidate on the ballot paper for possible futures It brings hope that we are more resilient than we think that we will be here that there will be trees that there will be books and readers and civilization Mitchell said he found writing the book quite liberating because I wont be around to take the consequences of this being good or bad But Im sandwiched between Margaret Atwood and no doubt some other brilliant writer So it better be good What a historic fool of epochal proportions Id look if they opened it in 2114 and it wasnt any good Usually says Mitchell who was shortlisted for the Man Booker for his novels number9dream and Cloud Atlas he polishes and polishes his writing Actually I overpolish But this was very different I wrote up to the wire So the first twothirds were polished and the final third I didnt have time And it was a liberation Future Library creator Paterson whose past works have involved her mapping dead stars and compiling a slide archive of the history of darkness through the ages asked the writers to tackle the theme of imagination and time which they can take in so many directions Mitchell revealed only the name of the manuscript From Me Flows What You Call Time during a ceremony in the Norwegian woods next to where Patersons 1000 trees are planted The title is taken from a piece of music by Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu but other than admitting that its somewhat more substantial a thing than I was expecting the author would say nothing Handing over his text in the forest sheltered from the intermittent rain by an umbrella and amid the foothigh shoots of 1000 pine trees Mitchell read his damp audience of children and adults a short story and William Wordsworths A slumber did my spirit seal Its ending Rolled round in earths diurnal course With rocks and stones and trees felt appropriate in this small section of forest carpeted with blueberry bushes which will be carefully tended to for the next 98 years before it is turned into Future Librarys manuscripts How vain to suppose the scribblings of little old me will be of enduring interest to future generations Yet how lowkey and understated to slave over a manuscript that nobody will ever pat you on the back for and say Nice one or God I loved the bit where she did that and he did this Mitchell wrote in a piece for the Future Library His manuscript now delivered will be sealed and placed alongside Atwoods in a woodlined room in Oslos new public library which will open in 2019 Watched over by a trust of experts until it is finally printed it is now says the novelist as gone from me as a coin dropped in a river,The critics usually analyse the novels of wellknown British author David Mitchell in detail But he is not worried about the critics this time He completed his latest book at 1am one Tuesday morning before a car arrived to take him to the airport to catch a flight to Norway No one will see this novel until 2114 Mitchell is the second author to be part of the Future Library project For the project they planted 1000 trees in 2014 in Oslos Nordmarka forest The first author Margaret Atwood gave the manuscript of a text called Scribbler Moon to the project in 2015 Each year for the next hundred years an author will write a novel that people will only read in 2114 when the trees are cut down to make paper to make the books Each author will travel to the place in the forest high above Oslo where they will give their manuscripts to the project in a short ceremony Its a little bit of hope at a time when there is lots of very depressing news It shows that we have a chance of civilization in a hundred years said Mitchell Everything is telling us that were doomed but the Future Library brings hope that we are stronger than we think that we will be here that there will be trees that there will be books and readers and civilization Mitchell said that writing this book made him feel free because I wont be around to know if people think its good or bad But before me was Margaret Atwood and next year Im sure there will be another brilliant writer So my book had better be good I would look such a fool if they opened my book in 2114 and it wasnt any good Mitchell says that he usually polishes and polishes his writing I polish too much But this was very different I wrote till the final minute So the first twothirds are polished and the final third I didnt have time And I felt free The creator of the Future Library asked writers to write on the theme of imagination and time Mitchell revealed only the name of the manuscript From Me Flows What You Call Time during a ceremony in the Norwegian woods next to where the 1000 trees are planted The title comes from a piece of music by Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu Mitchell only told us that his book is longer than I thought it would be He said nothing more In the forest Mitchell read a short story and a poem This small section of forest will be carefully managed for the next 98 years before it becomes Future Librarys manuscripts How vain to think my writing will be of interest to future generations But it is the opposite of vain to work hard on a manuscript that nobody will ever congratulate you for and say Good job or I loved the bit where she did that and he did this Mitchell wrote They will seal his manuscript and put it next to Atwoods manuscript in a room in Oslos new public library which will open in 2019 The manuscript is now says the author gone from me like a coin Ive dropped in a river,validation,ADV,ELE
96,There are worse things to do in life than stroll along Rios Copacabana beach in the sunshine on the way to watch a World Cup match so it was perhaps not surprising that England fan Anthony McDowell from Liverpool was having none of the doom and gloom that preceded some of the buildup to the tournament in Brazil The place is lovely The people are great Theres a party atmosphere said McDowell The only thing that could be better is the England team He and half a dozen friends are among the multitudes of supporters from around the world who have made the beachfront into a party zone of national colours and chants Some danced some posed for photos some drank but mostly they just walked and talked football waiting for the next game to begin on the nearby FanFest big screen The last time there were so many people here during the daytime the pope was visiting The cheerful largely peaceful mood was far from the protests transport chaos and stadium problems that plagued preparations for the World Cup But now the football is well and truly under way visiting supporters are determined to enjoy the experience If I had known when I started planning how complicated and costly it would be I wouldnt have come But now that were here its great said Brian Hill a retired chief executive from Sunderland The trip has not been problem free Hill travelled for more than 20 hours to get to Rio then hit long delays on the road from the airport at 630am His son Andrew had his sunglasses stolen almost as soon as he sat on the beach And they have been surprised that many bars are not set up with big screens for the games But like many fans they said they loved the atmosphere if not the logistics of this tournament which has got off to a spectacular start on the pitch Even the surliest cynic cannot have failed to be thrilled by Robin van Persies extraordinary diving header for the Netherlands against Spain Elsewhere there has been a glut of goals 28 in the rst eight games almost three times as many as at the same stage in South Africa in 2010 Adding to the carnival mood on the streets where the majority of fans are from neighbouring nations LatinAmerican teams won in every game they played up until the time of writing So far the tournament has avoided the worst Doomsday scenarios though it is far from trouble free The stadiums may have been delivered late and in some cases not fully nished but there have been no reports of structural problems or dif culties entering the grounds since the kick As at previous World Cups ticketing has been a problem with many empty seats at several games including the Netherlands against Spain FIFA spokesman SaintClair Milesi con rmed that only 48000 of the 51900 seats at the ground were lled FIFA is also investigating security lapses that allowed Chilean fans to let off reworks during their victory over Australia The Globo newspaper listed a number of shortcomings in the 12 host cities Almost all suffered worse traf c congestion than usual The worst transport problems were in Natal where bus drivers have been on strike since 12 June In Salvador some journey times were ve times longer than usual Traf c was already bad but this week it is chaotic Jecilda Mello president of residents group the Association of Friends of the Historic Centre told the paper But protests have diminished since the opening day when small demonstrations took place in several cities prompting police to use tear gas and pepper spray Since then the only security threat has been petty theft and overexcited fans A spontaneous street party of Argentinian fans was dispersed with pepper spray after the fans blocked roads The huge distances have led to some sharply contrasting World Cup experiences The tournament has made only a small mark on Sao Paulo South Americas most populous city but far away in Manaus the remote Amazonian city where England played Italy visitors said World Cup fever was in full swing with brightly decorated streets and ags uttering on many cars The FA chairman Greg Dyke said the shift in mood was palpable Weve had a really warm welcome in Manaus Its a big thing for them even if it is a bit strange to spend so much on a stadium with no one to play in it But we were in Sao Paulo for four or ve days in the runup to the opening match and you wouldnt have known until the last day that there was even a World Cup on It was weird,There are worse things to do in life than stroll along Rios Copacabana beach in the sunshine on the way to watch a World Cup match So it was not surprising that England fan

109,The view from the visitors centre at the southern edge of Donana National Park in southern Spain is striking to say the least This is an ornithologists dream 200000 hectares of salt marsh of unrivalled importance to the birdlife of western Europe Dozens of Britains most loved migratory birds including house martins swallows cuckoos and warblers rest here on their annual migrations from Africa Donana a UN World Heritage Site is also home to some of Europes rarest birds including the Spanish imperial eagle while its mammalian inhabitants include the highly endangered Iberian lynx It is a glorious vibrant landscape Yet it exists on a knifeedge a point illustrated dramatically in 1998 when almost two billion gallons of contaminated highly acidic water mixed with waste metals poured into the park from a dam that had burst its bank at Los Frailes mine 45km to the north A toxic tsunami of waste poured down the Guadiamar river and over its banks leaving a thick metallic crust over a vast stretch of parkland More than 25000 kilos of dead sh were collected in the aftermath and nearly 2000 adult birds chicks eggs and nests were killed or destroyed It was Spains worst environmental disaster and the cleanup cost 90m Suddenly aware of Donanas status as the nations most important natural site Spain decided to spend a further 360m some of it EU money on restoring the landscape which in the 1950s and 60s had been drained in places to create rice and cotton elds Some of this farmland is now being returned to its original wetland state It has been a costly but encouraging process Yet the fate of Donana still hangs in the balance thanks to the increasing pressures of modern life Plans have been outlined to build an oil pipeline through Donana while other developers have announced proposals to expand local tourist resorts whose new hotels and golf courses would demand water supplies that would further erode the local table Silt washed from nearby farms is also choking the channels that crisscross Donana However the real body blow for conservationists has been the recent decision of the Andalucian government to reopen the Frailes mine that so very nearly destroyed Donana in 1998 This is Europes most precious bird sanctuary both in terms of indigenous species and also as a resting place for birds that migrate between Africa and Britain and other parts of northwest Europe says Laurence Rose of the RSPB Royal Society for the Protection of Birds Donana already faces a great number of threats but now they want to bring back the very cause of its nearundoing 16 years ago It is extremely worrying Having spent so much restoring Donana to its past glories it might seem strange that the local government should choose to announce that it wants mining companies to tender bids to rework Los Frailes However a brief examination of the state of the local economy provides an explanation The crash of Spains banks in 2008 hit the region catastrophically and unemployment in some parts of Andalucia is now more than 30 Reopening the mine would provide more than 1000 precious jobs There are riches here riches that are badly needed by local inhabitants said Vicente Fernandez Guerrero secretarygeneral of Innovation Industry and Energy for Andalucia We think mining is a good way to make it possible to allow local people to continue to live in the area This is a mining area People have been digging metals and ores here since Roman times after all More to the point added Fernandez the mine licence would stipulate that only modern mining techniques which avoid the creation of poisonous wet waste would be allowed It has also stipulated that the Canadian company that ran Los Frailes cannot bid for the contract Sixteen years after the accident the two sides remained locked over compensation claims The best technology in the world will be used here Fernandez insisted Liquid will not be used We are going to insist on that Our tender makes that clear The proposal has some support in the area but it also has a lot of opposition One road sign I passed was liberally daubed with obscenities about the workers union UGT which supports the mines reopening For his part Carlos Davila who works for the Spanish Ornithological Society in Donana was also alarmed at the proposal This is a very very bad idea indeed he told me They say the new mine will be safe but they said it was safe in 1998 and look what happened We got the worst ecological disaster in the history of Spain What alarms people such as Davila is the threat that a new mine poses to the intense investment in ecotourism that has been made in Donana in recent years An example is provided at the restaurant Dehesa de Abajo where you can have a drink or a meal surrounded by trees in which storks and black kites are nesting Virtually every visitor was equipped with a camera and telescopic lens or a pair of binoculars There is a clear tourist trade to be made from the birdlife of Donana Nor should this be surprising for this is a truly special place A vast hemisphere of sky hangs over this utterly at but certainly not featureless landscape Birds of every shape and size ll the air and sometimes the road At one point on my visit a stork calmly stood in front of our car until it felt ready to y off The trouble is that Spain does not have the public resources it possessed 16 years ago A repeat of the toxin spill today would have a much much more damaging impact said Rose This point is backed by Davila After the disaster Spain woke up to the fact that it possessed a place of real ecological importance and did a lot to clean it up and protect it he added Now we seem to be forgetting that lesson It is very depressing,The view from the visitors centre in the Donana National Park in southern Spain is a bird watchers dream 200000 hectares of wetlands vital for the birds of western Europe Many of Britains most loved migratory birds rest here every year on their migrations from Africa Donana is also home to some of Europes rarest birds including the Spanish imperial eagle It is a beautiful landscape but it is under threat In 1998 almost two billion gallons of toxic water full of acid and waste metals poured into the park from the Los Frailes mine 45km away They collected more than 25000 kilos of dead sh afterwards and nearly 2000 adult birds chicks eggs and nests were killed or destroyed It was Spains worst environmental disaster and the cleanup cost 90 million Spain realized that Donana is the nations most important natural site so the country decided to spend an extra 360 million on restoring the landscape to its original wetland state It has been an expensive process And Donana is still under threat from the pressures of modern life There are plans to build an oil pipeline through Donana and there is also an idea to build new hotels and golf courses which would use a lot of local water Sand and soil washed from nearby farms is also blocking the channels that cross the park But the biggest shock has been the recent decision of the Andalucian government to reopen the Frailes mine that nearly destroyed Donana in 1998 This is Europes most important bird sanctuary says Laurence Rose of the RSPB Royal Society for the Protection of Birds Donana already faces a lot of threats but now they want to bring back the cause of the disaster 16 years ago It is extremely worrying If you look at the state of the local economy you quickly see why the government has made this decision The crash of Spains banks in 2008 had a very bad effect on the region Unemployment in some parts of Andalucia is now more than 30 If they reopen the mine it would create more than 1000 jobs There are riches here riches that the local

76,Glastonbury Festival is to combat the scourge of the plastic water bottle as part of a longterm strategy to become the worlds most environmentally friendly outdoor music event Festival organizers are targeting the disposable bottle one of the most conspicuous symbols of the throwaway culture that each year leaves the 900acre Somerset site wreathed in plastic with an estimated one million plastic bottles being used during the festival Stainlesssteel reusable bottles will be given to 2000 road crew and band members with thousands more on sale to festivalgoers to stop them relying on plastic bottles The 140000 ticketholders are also being urged to bring reusable bottles that they can fill at 400 drinkingwater taps dotted across the site Lucy Smith Glastonburys green issues organizer said We have amazing water quality in the UK but everyone is obsessed with drinking bottled water She said the initiative precedes a plan for Glastonbury 2015 to replace all plastic beer glasses and cutlery with reusable items in an attempt to eradicate the legacy of plastic waste from the huge rural site Environmentalists estimate that 150 million tonnes of plastic waste currently litters the planet and oceans poisoning ecosystems and killing wildlife Ultimately festival organizers hope to make Glastonbury the worlds greenest greenfield festival emulating Americas Burning Man festival in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada which is a leavenotrace event where people have to take away all that they bring Glastonbury revellers are also being urged to travel to the site on public transport or try carsharing with friends We want to be as sustainable as we can We do everything we can but coping with the litter of 140000 people is a challenge We cant put bins everywhere added Smith Campaigners say that plastic water bottles can take hundreds or even thousands of years to completely biodegrade with their manufacture exacerbating their negative ecological impact Millions of barrels of oil are used in the manufacture of plastic bottles and the transportation of mineral water across the planet produces even more carbon emissions Overall an estimated 13 billion plastic water bottles are sold in the UK every year yet just one in five is said to be recycled Smith said that instead of buying bottled water festivalgoers should take advantage of the water on tap which is being drawn from huge underground reservoirs instead of oldfashioned water tanks that provided heavily chlorinated drinking water The charity WaterAid will also set up water kiosks around the site stocking reusable bottles and cups and offering free refills In 2015 the kiosks modelled on those found in Africa will double as DJ booths at night Organizers say that almost half of all the rubbish left on site was recycled in 2013 and add that there will be 15000 bins for recycling across the festival grounds in 2014 Despite its growing ecocredentials critics continue to snipe at Glastonbury accusing it of becoming increasingly corporate in tone The latest critic Iron Maidens Bruce Dickinson has vowed never to bring his band to Glastonbury Festival after dismissing it as the most bourgeois thing on the planet The weather forecast for Glastonbury was positive with the festival due to be sunny and dry experts ruling out a repeat of 1985 the festivals windiest year 1997 its muddiest and 2005 known as the year of thunder,Glastonbury Festival wants to fight a war against plastic water bottles They plan to become the worlds most environmentally friendly outdoor music event Each year disposable bottles leave the Somerset festival site covered in plastic About one million plastic bottles are used during the festival The festival organizers will give stainlesssteel

30,Not nearly enough exercise classes have a tea break halfway through But Margaret Allens does After a gentle warmup and a few pulseraising numbers the 93yearold greatgrandmother lets her charges rehydrate with a cup of tea and a quick sit down Some of the eightstrong class look as if they need it more than others Allen herself wearing a thick turquoise shirt navy knitted waistcoat black slacks and sensible shoes has not broken into a sweat Despite an excruciating trapped nerve in one leg and a knee in need of replacement she looks as though she could go on for hours The general rule is that eating directly before sport is not the best idea let alone part way through But on the afternoon I visit Allens class at a church hall in SaltburnbytheSea near Middlesbrough slices of fruitcake are being passed around during the break The cake has been baked in honour of Allens recent birthday by her 89yearold sister Joan known locally as the scone queen of Saltburn The ladies have barely swallowed their last crumb when Allen is up again leading the group through a jaunty Scottish number involving lots of toe pointing and leg kicking Fortyfive minutes later the class is finally over Allen a former volunteer with the Red Cross has been leading classes in the northeast seaside town for 45 years Not particularly sporty at school she started playing the piano for a keepfit class during the second world war just for something to do during the blackouts really and eventually took over in her 40s when the previous instructor retired At its peak Allens class had more than 18 regulars each paying 1 a time But these days her flock is diminishing fast during the teabreak the ladies discuss a funeral that most of them had attended that week for one of the younger members of the group who had just died aged 68 from motor neurone disease Allen is the oldest followed by her sister The baby of the group is 60yearold Jean Cunion who credits the group with supporting her through a difficult time when her mother died She is somewhat embarrassed to admit that she is perhaps the least fit of the group I remember the first time I came Margaret said Whos that huffing and panting and I had to admit it was me Ruth Steere 76 marvels at how Allen never misses a trick despite always having her back to the class She always shouts at us if we go wrong Shes remarkably good at knowing what we are doing Allen a keen dancer has never done any formal training to be a fitness instructor Instead she choreographs her own moves based on five tapes from the BBCs first ever fitness guru Eileen Fowler who died in 2000 when she was 93 Allens age now Allen thinks her good health is largely down to keeping busy especially since her husband Joe died in 1997 She took up writing poetry when she was 80 I write poems about everything Im a prolific writer I just cant stop she says phoning me a few days after the interview to read out a ditty she has written about the joys of exercise One of the class 84yearold former teacher Winnie Robertson thinks the secret to staying fit is never letting yourself go Use it or lose it thats what I say Allen still plays the piano and gives speeches She is president of the Womens Fellowship at the local methodist church and is one of three 90plus year olds at the scrabble club of the University of the Third Age She did a computer course when she was 88 and tried to get online but it didnt work out Ageing is no fun she admits reading me a few lines from a poem she has written called That Beast Called Age She happily recalls a doctor who saw her for the first time a few years back who said she couldnt possibly be more than 78 I said Thank you doctor You can go now She also has a nononsense attitude to weight gain I just think people shouldnt eat too much Whenever I hear someone saying Oh I cant lose weight I say Sellotape She mimes taping her mouth shut I said this just the other day to a big fat man Everything in moderation is my motto Earlier in 2013 Allen was watching the news and saw a woman being given the British Empire Medal I think she means Margaret Chartwood from Horley who was given the honour in January at the age of 77 She was saying Im 80 and Im the oldest fitness instructor in the country I was thinking No youre not But I shant be writing to Buckingham Palace,Not many exercise classes have

120,That millennials rely heavily on technology is no secret More than eight in ten say they sleep with a mobile phone by their bed almost two thirds admit to texting while driving one in ve has posted a video of themselves online and three quarters have created a pro le on a social networking site Compared to other generations millennials are the most active on social media according to a 2010 report with 75 of them having created at least one social media account In contrast only 50 of Generation X 30 of baby boomers and 6 of those aged 65 and older use social media But there is a small percentage of millennials who dont use social media at all Meet the millennials bucking the trend Celan Beausoleil 31 Oakland California Beausoleil is a social worker and has had an on and off more off than on relationship with Facebook She last deactivated her account in December 2015 after nding the amount of personal information shared by others too heavy to deal with on top of her work demands A lot of my job is listening to peoples lives all day every day and it started to feel so overwhelming to go on social media and see every single detail of everybodys life including people that I dont really have a relationship with she said It feels almost like intimacy overload She added Im holding a lot in my work life for people and sometimes it felt like it was too heavy to do in my personal life also But Beausoleil does love the way social media connects the world in a truly unique way citing it as one of her only reasons for staying on Facebook for as long as she did One thing I really liked about Facebook was that I could sit for hours and click on a friend and then click on one of their friends and one of their friends and one of their friends and literally end up on someones Facebook page from the other side of the world she said I used to do that all the time Jason Mathias 26 Baltimore Maryland One day I realized Im spending so much time doing this These little seconds add up I wonder what it would be like if I didnt spend these seconds here and spent them doing something else What if I was doing other things with these seconds What would they become Would I enjoy it Mathias who works for the Baltimore City government had Facebook and Twitter accounts for years before deleting them both in November 2012 But he quickly forgot that Facebook existed after his impromptu decision to end his social media presence He can still appreciate the bene ts that come with having social media accounts like when he met his girlfriends friends for the rst time and realized humanizing 20 people youre meeting at a party is much easier if you can connect their faces hometowns and jobs to a photo later on Or how easy it is to organize large events online Mathias relies on friends for party invites and is sure there are times he slips through the cracks But now he relishes the time thats freed up He spends his lift rides and spare moments at work reading news articles and books rather than scrolling through a newsfeed And with no friends accounts to follow online he has to pick up the phone and call them something hes come to de nitely enjoy Lauren Raskauskas 22 Naples Florida Raskauskas describes herself as a pretty private person So social media which can open you up to the scrutiny and analysis of others is not that appealing to her Im more privacyminded and have concerns about giving out my data said Raskauskas who is currently looking for a job She recently deleted her Twitter account and deactivated her Facebook account two years ago after realizing she didnt like everyone knowing what I was doing But Raskauskas who was late to the Facebook game because her parents were really strict with technology can see the positive sides of social media When a friend of hers that shed lost track of moved to Naples for a month Raskauskas didnt even realize she was there until after shed left which the 22yearold said was a bummer But in the end her privacy concerns outweighed any bene ts social media could provide and she saw a de nite upside when she went through a recent breakup The last time a relationship of hers ended and she was online it was not pleasant One time I did break up with somebody while I was on Facebook and I was like Oh my gosh should I change my pro le photo Should I change my status And this time I dont have to worry about any of that because that kind of stuff is pretty hard she said Hariharan Rajagopalan 18 Boston Massachusetts Rajagopalan a student at Boston College doesnt see any drawbacks to abstaining from social media He claims that he hasnt seen any effect at this point Even though classmates post about parties and events on Facebook they make sure to send him a text message too he said Since I was young I was always a step behind on that kind of thing so it never really mattered to me he said In fact the only time Rajagopalan made use of social media was when it was unavoidable it was the only way to reach his new roommate at college Before starting his rst year at college he signed up for his rst and only social media account He joined Facebook in order to contact his future roommate and talk about their plans for that year Months later he still has the account but he admits I dont use it I dont check it or anything like that The most activity it sees is when his two sisters tag him in family photos He has avoided social media accounts in all other situations though he has felt the draw of Twitter As a sports fan he acknowledged that its where most of the news breaks out But he refused to get an account stating I dont really need one to read tweets,It is no secret that millenials use social media a lot More than eight in ten say they sleep with a mobile phone by their bed almost two thirds say they text while driving and three quarters have created a pro le on a social networking site But some millenials dont use social media at all Here are four of them Celan Beausoleil 31 Oakland California Beausoleil is a social worker and has had an on and off relationship with Facebook She deleted her account recently because the amount of personal information about other people was too much for her In my job I spend a lot of time listening to peoples lives all day every day and it started to feel too much to go on social media and see every detail of everybodys lives including people that I dont know very well she said But she loves the way social media connects the world in a unique way One thing I really liked about Facebook was that I could sit for hours and click on a friend and then click on one of their friends and nish on someones Facebook page from the other side of the world she said I used to do that all the time Jason Mathias 26 Baltimore Maryland One day I realized Im spending so much time doing this I wonder what it would be like if I didnt spend this time here and spent it doing something else What if I was doing other things with these seconds What would they become Would I enjoy it Mathias had Facebook and Twitter accounts for years but deleted them in November 2012 He quickly forgot that Facebook existed but he can still understand the bene ts of having social media accounts for example how easy it is to organize large events online But now he loves his extra free time He spends his spare moments at work reading news articles and books And with no friends to follow online he has to pick up the phone and call them something he now enjoys Lauren Raskauskas 22 Naples Florida Raskauskas describes herself as a private person So she doesnt like social media much She has deleted her Twitter account and deleted her Facebook account two years ago when she realized that she didnt like everyone knowing what I was doing She recently broke up with her partner The last time she broke up with someone and she was online it was not nice One time I broke up with somebody while I was on Facebook and I thought Oh my gosh should I change my pro le photo Should I change my status And this time I dont have to worry about that she said Hariharan Rajagopalan 18 Boston Massachusetts Rajagopalana student at Boston College doesnt see a problem with not using social media He says that he hasnt seen any effect at this point His classmates post about parties and events on Facebook but

100,It is not just the worlds biggest burger chain it is also a global emblem of American consumer capitalism But these days the golden arches of McDonalds are looking a little tarnished After a decade of expansion customers around the world dont seem to be lovin it any more McDonalds has revealed that worldwide sales dropped by 33 on 2013 in a set of results that were described as atrocious Problems are piling up almost everywhere In China sales plunged by 23 after a food scare when local media showed workers apparently caught on camera at a local supplier claiming to use outofdate beef and chicken in products destined for McDonalds and KFC In Europe sales are down by 4 mostly because of unrest in Ukraine and the sour antiwestern mood in Russia Around 200 of McDonalds 450 restaurants in Russia are being investigated by health inspectors in apparently politically motivated foodsafety checks Ten have been closed But it is in the US where McDonalds has around 40 of its restaurants where the crisis runs deepest Almost 60 years after Ray Kroc opened his rst restaurant in Des Plaines Illinois consumers are losing their appetite for a Big Mac and fries McDonalds has seen 12 straight months of declining sales in its massive home market with sales down 41 in the latest quarter Younger diners are deserting the restaurant in droves to eat out at rivals such as Chipotle Mexican Grill The number of 19to21yearolds visiting McDonalds once a month has fallen by 13 since 2011 according to food analysts Technomic while the number of 22to37year olds visiting has not grown To add to the companys problems McDonalds hamburgers were recently named the worst in America in a poll of more than 32000 American diners who said they would rather eat a burger at Five Guys Smashburger or Fuddruckers Fastgrowing USonly chain Chick lA was considered to be best for chicken McDonalds is also widely perceived as less healthy than most of its rivals especially Chipotle which trumpets its antibioticfree meat and locally sourced seasonal produce although local for Chipotle can mean 350 miles away The depth of consumer mistrust of McDonalds was exposed by a consumer outreach exercise the company launched in the US in October Have you ever used pink slime in your burgers was one question on the Our Food Your Questions website referring to the controversial beef ller gristle and fat used for dog food that is sprayed with ammonia to make it t for human consumption The meat product banned in Europe since the BSE crisis was dropped by McDonalds in 2012 But pink slime has left doubts in US consumers minds Does McDonalds beef contain worms asked another person No Gross End of story replied the company Others wanted to know whether it uses real eggs or whether the McRib is made with the same plastic contained in yoga mats McDonalds Chief Executive Don Thompson acknowledged the company had a job to do in addressing misconceptions about the freshness quality and integrity of its ingredients Yet just as McDonalds has been losing the customers who will pay a bit more for food perceived as fresher and healthier it has also lost its edge in fastfood essentials speedy service at low prices Ever since it introduced 2 items on its dollar menu it has gained a reputation for being more expensive than its rivals while many consumers complain that service is slower The expensive tag was unjusti ed said Mary Chapman at Technomic Prices have indeed gone up but they havent gone up as quickly as the rest of the fastservice chains in the US Prices at McDonalds have increased by 48 since 2009 well below the quick service sector average up 194 while the cost of fast casual eating a category that includes the muchhyped Chipotle is up 169 according to Technomics menu monitor US consumer prices rose 11 over the same period But critics have a point when it comes to longer queues McDonalds has a bigger menu than some with more complicated items its chicken McWrap takes 60 seconds to make I think it is worth waiting but the guy behind me who wants his double cheeseburger for a dollar might not said Chapman In the UK McDonalds has turned around its business making Britain a rare bright spot for the company A competitive breakfast menu improved coffee and free wi had given McDonalds a broad appeal in the UK said Peter Martin of consultancy CGA Peach whose gures show that 56 of British adults have visited a McDonalds restaurant at least once in the last six months Executives are promising to tackle misconceptions about its food in its home market Thompson has promised more organic food and custommade burgers but to cut down queues he also wants to introduce simpler menus Analysts are scratching their heads about how the company can square the circle of simpler menus and greater choice over llings They want to simplify the menu but enhance its ability to customize and that sounds tricky said Mark Kalinowski at Janney Capital Markets Only four out of McDonalds 14000 US restaurants had so far tested build your own burger he said raising questions about how it could be scaled up Right now we are sceptical we would like to see more detail Meanwhile despite the declining sales the chain continues to expand globally by the end of 2014 it expects to have opened 1400 new restaurants Kalinowski expects McDonalds market share will continue to shrink but he too warned against writing off the company You can never really count McDonalds out We think it will be number one in terms of total sales for not just years but decades to come,McDonalds is the worlds biggest burger chain and a symbol of American consumer capitalism But these days the golden arches of McDonalds are not looking so golden The company has got much bigger since 2003 but now the numbers of customers are falling McDonalds says that its worldwide sales have fallen by 33 The company has problems almost everywhere In China sales fell by 23 In Europe sales fell by 4 mostly because of problems in Ukraine and the antiwestern mood in Russia Health inspectors have investigated around 200 of McDonalds 450 restaurants in Russia and they have closed ten restaurants But the worst crisis is in the US where McDonalds has around 40 of its restaurants Almost 60 years since Ray Kroc opened his rst restaurant in Des Plaines Illinois consumers are losing their appetite for a Big Mac and fries Sales have fallen every month for 12 months in the US Many younger diners are eating at rival companies such as Chipotle Mexican Grill The number of 19to21yearolds who visit McDonalds once a month has fallen by 13 since 2011 Another problem is that McDonalds hamburgers were recently named the worst in America in a poll of more than 32000 American diners they said they would rather eat a burger at Five Guys Smashburger or Fuddruckers Many people also believe that McDonalds is less healthy than most of its rivals especially Chipotle Chipotle uses antibioticfree meat and locally sourced seasonal ingredients McDonalds asked customers for their opinions in the US in October Someone asked Have you ever used pink slime in your burgers pink slime is the beef ller that is used for dog food McDonalds stopped using this meat product in 2012 but McDonalds Chief Executive Don Thompson said the company still had to improve peoples opinions about the freshness and quality of its ingredients McDonalds has always had a reputation for fast service at low prices But since it introduced 2 items on its dollar menu people think it is more expensive than its rivals and many consumers complain that service is slower But Mary Chapman at food analysts Technomic said that it wasnt fair to say that McDonalds was more expensive than its rivals Prices have gone up but they havent gone up as quickly as the rest of the fastfood chains in the US Prices at McDonalds have increased by 48 since 2009 much less than the fastfood average up 194 But people are right when they complain that the queues are longer McDonalds has a bigger menu than some other restaurants with more complicated items its chicken McWrap takes 60 seconds to make I think it is worth waiting but the guy behind me who wants his double cheeseburger for a dollar might not said Chapman McDonald managers are promising to improve peoples opinions about its food in the

110,Brazil experienced one of its biggest nights of protest in decades as more than 100000 people took to the streets nationwide to express their frustration at heavyhanded policing poor public services and high costs for the World Cup The major demonstrations in Rio de Janeiro So Paulo Brasilia Belem Belo Horizonte Salvador and elsewhere started peacefully but several led to clashes with police and arson attacks on cars and buses The large turnout and geographic spread marked a rapid escalation after previous smaller protests against bus price increases led to complaints that police responded disproportionately with rubber bullets tear gas and violent beatings Coinciding with the start of the Confederations Cup a World Cup test event the rallies brought together a wide coalition of people frustrated with the escalating costs and persistently poor quality of public services lavish investment in international sporting events low standards of health care and wider unease about inequality and corruption While the vast majority of demonstrations in Rio were peaceful several police were injured in clashes at the citys legislative assembly at least one car was overturned and burned and windows were smashed in the offices of banks and notary offices The unrest escalated during the night as a large crowd set several fires outside the legislative assembly smashed the buildings windows and painted graffiti on the walls proclaiming Revolution Down with Paes down with Cabral the mayor and state governor and Hate police Police inside responded with pepper spray and perhaps more the Guardian saw one protester passed out and bleeding heavily from a wound in the upper arm The causes pursued by the protesters varied widely We are here because we hate the government They do nothing for us said Oscar Jos Santos a 19 year old who was with a group of hooded youths from the Rocinha favela Im an architect but I have been unemployed for six months There must be something wrong with this country said Nadia al Husin holding up a banner calling on the government to do more for education At a far smaller rally in Brasilia demonstrators broke through police lines to enter the highsecurity area of the national congress Several climbed onto the roof In Belo Horizonte police clashed with protesters who tried to break through a cordon around a football stadium hosting a Confederations Cup match between Nigeria and Tahiti In Porto Alegre demonstrators set fire to a bus and in Curitiba protesters attempted to force their way into the office of the state governor There were also rallies in Belem Salvador and elsewhere In So Paulo which had seen the fiercest clashes the previous week and the main allegations of police violence large crowds gathered once again but initial reports suggested the marches passed peacefully Reflecting the importance of social networks in spreading the message about the protests some in So Paulo where numbers were estimated at between 30000 and 100000 carried banners declaring We come from Facebook Most protesters were young and for many it was their first experience of such a giant rally My generation has never experienced this said Thiago Firbida a student Since the dictatorship Brazilians never bothered to take over the streets They did not believe they had a reason to But now Brazil is once again in crisis with a constant rise in prices so people are finally reacting Comparisons have been drawn with rallies in Turkey and elsewhere Another global link was evident in the handful of demonstrators who wore Guy Fawkes masks associated with Anonymous and the Occupy Wall Street protests Brazils demonstrations are being referred to as the vinegar revolution after police arrested people for carrying vinegar to counter tear gas as well as the 20cent revolution due to the bus price rise and the Passe Livre after the demand for free public transport Some said the protests felt unBrazilian but liberating Our politicians need to see the strength we have as one people Brazilians tend to be too nice sometimes they enjoy partying rather than protesting but something is changing said Deli Borsari a 53yearold yoga instructor Following widespread news coverage of the costs of new and refurbished stadiums the Confederations Cup football tournament has been one of the focuses of the protests Before the opening match in Brasilia crowds of demonstrators were dispersed by riot police Footage showed frightened Japanese supporters rushing from the area holding their children as the sound of shots perhaps rubber bullets or tear gas was heard Another protest march near Rios Maracana Stadium was met with a similarly heavy police response Most of the rallies appeared to start peacefully until they confronted the security forces who are largely organized at a regional level President Dilma Rousseff condones the protests according to her aides The president believes peaceful protests are legitimate and proper for a democracy and that it is natural for young people to demonstrate said Helena Chagas of the presidents office However the president was booed at the opening ceremony for the Confederations Cup With the economy in bad shape and social unrest on the rise she faces a serious political challenge both now and in 2014 when Brazil will not only host the World Cup but also have a presidential election,More than 100000 people went onto the streets in Brazil to show their anger at violent police poor public services and high costs for the World Cup The demonstrations in Rio de Janeiro So Paulo Brasilia Belem Belo Horizonte and Salvador started peacefully but there were some clashes with police and people set fire to cars and buses People complained

140,Writing in the journal Nature former president of the Royal Institute of Navigation Roger McKinlay argues that our reliance on GPS global positioning system technology is misplaced and could be eroding our innate way nding abilities If we do not cherish them our natural navigation abilities will deteriorate as we rely ever more on smart devices he wrote McKinlay believes huge investment will be needed before navigation systems will be good enough to allow technologies such as autonomous vehicles to take off In the meantime he argues we need better research into systems for navigation while children should be encouraged to learn how to nd their way around by more traditional means Schools should teach navigation and map reading as life skills he wrote According to Ofcom the Of ce of Communications around 66 of adults in the UK owned a smartphone in 2015 up from 39 in 2012 making GPS technology widely available But McKinlay a satellite communication and navigation consultant believes that we should be wary of leaving our navigational needs to our devices Navigation is a useitorloseit skill he wrote While few scienti c studies have explored the issue research from 2009 supports the notion What we did was to look at a set of current London taxi drivers and a set of London taxi drivers that had been retired for about four years said neuroscientist Dr Hugo Spiers head of the Spatial Cognition Group at University College London who is an author of the study The results showed that the retired taxi drivers performed worse on navigation tests than those still behind the wheel We were able to show that their abilities did drop away if they werent using their knowledge on that particular test Spiers also believes there is a danger in relying on technologies like GPS but he is quick to point out that the biggest risk lies in users being unwittingly led into perilous situations Among the fatalities blamed on satnavs satellite navigation devices was the death of a driver who in 2010 plunged into a reservoir in Spain There is a genuine potential for risk in relying on a satnav said Spiers But the actual health risk of not using your brain effectively is not known The way in which navigational technology is used could also affect its impact on our own abilities says Spiers While audio instructions to drivers remove the need to think about navigation he says the use of smartphone apps as digital maps is very different In the old days you had to print out or take an A to Z map in your pocket what we are doing now is just using computer aided information and you are having to think really quite hard about where you are going and interact with this device he said The modern technology isnt just dumbing us down completely McKinlay remains convinced that navigation technologies have a long way to go before futuristic scenarios involving driverless cars and smart cities become a reality For really critical applications safety applications like landing aircraft or navigating aircraft GPS is still not good enough he said Though Spiers believes the development of arti cial intelligence based on machine learning could lead to a new wave of navigational aids McKinlay remains sceptical We will see ever smarter machines which are very very task speci c but the big breakthrough will be when they are able to tune in to what you might be thinking and what you might be wanting to achieve he said Ultimately McKinlay believes its essential that humans remain able to take control of their navigation Do you really want to encourage people to get to a point where when it disappears or when the battery goes at they are in total shock and can do nothing he said Technology isnt magic it is just a tool,Roger McKinlay is the former president of the Royal Institute of Navigation He says that our use of GPS global positioning system technology is damaging our ability to nd our way If we do not look after them we will lose our natural navigation abilities because we rely on technology more and more he wrote McKinlay believes it will take a lot of time and money before navigation systems will be good enough for technologies such as driverless cars to become successful He says we need better research into systems for navigation Also children should learn to nd their way using more traditional methods Schools should teach navigation and map reading he wrote In 2012 39 of adults in the UK had a smartphone In 2015 66 of adults had a smartphone So most people now use GPS technology But McKinlay a satellite communication and navigation consultant believes that we should be careful not to only use our smartphones for navigation If we dont practise using our navigation skills we will lose them he wrote Research from 2009 supports this idea We studied a group of current London taxi drivers and a group of retired London taxi drivers said Dr Hugo Spiers of University College London who is an author of the study The results showed that the retired taxi drivers did worse on navigation tests than the current drivers We were able to show that their abilities decreased after they stopped using their knowledge Spiers also believes it is dangerous to rely on technologies like GPS But he says that the biggest problem is that technologies can lead drivers into dangerous situations One of the deaths caused by satnavs satellite navigation was of a driver who in 2010 drove into a lake in Spain It can be dangerous to use a satnav said Spiers The way we use navigation technology also has an impact on our own abilities says Spiers If drivers listen to instructions they dont need to think about where they are going he says but the use of smartphone apps as digital maps is better When you use digital maps you have to think hard about where you are going he said McKinlay believes there have to be big improvements in navigation technologies before we can have futuristic things like driverless cars and smart cities For really important jobs like landing aeroplanes or ying aeroplanes GPS is still not good enough he said McKinlay believes humans must still able to take control of their navigation

54,SeaWorld has suffered an 84 collapse in pro ts as customers have deserted the controversial aquatic theme park company following claims it mistreated orca whales The company which trains dolphins and killer whales to perform tricks in front of stadiums full of spectators has reported declines in attendance sales and pro ts because of continued brand challenges SeaWorld has been in the headlines since the 2013 documentary Black sh detailed claims that its treatment of orca whales provoked violent behaviour contributing to the deaths of three people Following the release of the documentary attendance collapsed the company lost more than half of its market value on Wall Street and its former CEO was forced out The company has since launched a nationwide marketing campaign to combat animal rights activists claims that among other things captive orcas die at a younger age than their wild counterparts Despite cutting ticket prices and spending 10m on the marketing blitz which features its veterinarians caring for whales SeaWorld CEO Joel Manby was forced to admit that the company is still struggling to convince the public that it treats its whales well We realize we have much work ahead of us to recover more of our attendance base increase revenue and improve our performance as returning to historical performance levels will take time and investment Manby said On the reputation side early feedback on our campaign has been positive However we recognize that fully resolving our brand challenges in California will require sustained focus and commitment to correct misinformation We will continue to ght with the facts because the facts are on our side he said recently on a conference call with journalists and analysts Manby who joined the company as CEO in 2015 to help the company rehabilitate itself said he would set out his vision for the future of the company at a special event on 6 November Already in the pipeline are plans for a new shark exhibition in Orlando and an attraction in San Antonio that will allow customers to swim with dolphins in a naturalistic setting The companys nancial report released on 6 August showed net income in the second quarter dropped from 374m in 2014 to 58m in 2015 an 84 decrease Revenue fell from 405m to 392m Attendance dropped by more than 100000 from 658 million to 648 million Analysts will now be closely watching SeaWorlds sales and attendance numbers in the third quarter which is traditionally the companys most pro table and covers the summer holiday season Attendance may suffer from a fresh scandal in July 2015 in which a SeaWorld employee was alleged to have in ltrated animal rights protest groups against the company Jared Goodman director of animal law for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals PETA which has been leading campaigns against SeaWorld said SeaWorld is in the midst of a spying scandal animals are dying in its tanks and tens of thousands of people have opposed its bid to build a new orca prison so it should come as no surprise that SeaWorlds quarterly earnings have plummeted yet again in the second quarter Families just dont want to buy tickets to see orcas going insane inside tiny tanks and SeaWorlds pro ts like the orcas wont recover until the abusement park empties its tanks and builds coastal sanctuaries SeaWorlds shares which were worth 39 in 2013 were changing hands for just under 18 in August 2015,SeaWorlds pro ts fell by 84 and customers are staying away from the water theme park company because a lm claimed that it mistreated orca whales The company teaches dolphins and killer whales to do tricks in front of large crowds of people It says fewer people are going to its parks and pro ts have reduced SeaWorld has been in the news since the 2013 documentary lm Black sh which said that SeaWorld mistreated orca whales this made the whales act violently and caused the deaths of three people Animal rights organizations say that orcas kept in tanks die at a younger age than wild whales SeaWorld started a national marketing campaign to show this isnt true SeaWorld has reduced ticket prices and spent 10m on a marketing campaign But SeaWorld CEO Joel Manby said that the company still nds it dif cult to convince people that it treats its whales well We realize we have much work to do Manby said Talking about the companys reputation he said Early feedback on our marketing campaign has been positive We will continue to ght with the facts because the facts are on our side he said Manby joined the company as CEO in 2015 to help the company recover He will give a presentation about his ideas for the future of the company on 6 November There are already plans for a new shark exhibition in Orlando and an attraction in San Antonio that will allow customers to swim with dolphins The companys nancial report from 6 August showed that their pro t in the second quarter dropped from 374 million in 2014 to 58 million in 2015 This is an 84

SeaWorld Jared Goodman from PETA said SeaWorld has lots of problems Animals are dying in its tanks and tens of thousands of people do not want it to build a new orca prison Families dont want to buy tickets to see orcas going insane inside tiny tanks and SeaWorlds pro ts wont increase until it closes its parks and builds sanctuaries by the coast SeaWorlds shares which were worth 39 in 2013 fell

116,You can no longer legally smoke a cigarette inside a bar in the worlds drinking capital New Orleans Louisiana City after city has banned indoor smoking but thats different because other cities dont attract tourist dollars by aggressively advertising a let the good times roll attitude as New Orleans does An indoor smoking ban here will have consequences as unique as New Orleanss cultural ecosystem itself As the Wall Street Journal recently reported New Orleans city government has since Hurricane Katrina in 2005 begun trying to turn down the volume a bit With the support of neighbourhood groups the city has begun policing bars and nightclubs more strictly while at the same time ghting to implement a new noise ordinance read music ordinance This is just the wrong time for them to have pursued something like this complains bar owner William Walker who for reasons of personal choice hates the antismoking law Forcing people outside the bar to smoke is going to exacerbate the tension thats already there Many of New Orleanss best bars and some of its live music spots are in relatively quiet residential neighbourhoods This neighbourly coexistence is a big part of what makes New Orleans different and charming Recently though this unique social contract has become unacceptable for some people and the fate of New Orleanss musical personality feels at stake Martha Wood lives beside a loud bar that hosts live music The bar was one of the deciding factors in me buying the house so I wont ever complain about the noise says Wood who also manages a livemusic bar which following a series of noise issues in 2013 including complaints about the loud smokers outside became one of New Orleanss rst ever bars legally disallowed from serving drinks to go Now any small infraction could get us shut down says Wood We recently installed a smoke eater to help with the smoke because we cant open the doors at night because of the noise The Maple Leaf club went smokefree voluntarily in 2014 as did another club where artists had been demanding smokefree nights A lot of the performance venues were already starting to show that consideration to performers so I wish the city would have just let that happen instead of forcing the ban into every corner bar that doesnt host music says Zalia BeVille manager of the All Ways Lounge which went smokefree in 2013 because she says The horn players and the singers they asked us for it Luckily All Ways has an outdoor patio unlike Lost Love Lounge whose owner Geoff Douville loves the ban hed previously felt forced to live with smoke to keep his bar nancially viable Theres no way I could have banned smoking in my bar without it being a rule throughout the whole city says Douville People act like I have that choice as a business owner But if I make that rule they walk down the block to a bar with smoking So I need it to be uniformed across the board for everybody Many small business owners also fear smoke free revenue loss Smoker Neil Timms owns an English pub and met the smoking ban before in England Back home in Coventry every pub where I was a regular closed within a year of the smoking ban remembers Timms of the UKs ban begun in 2007 To avoid the same fate hes spending money to build a patio Lost Loves Douville though feels the ban to be a great business opportunity The number of people who would enjoy coming out to our bar with our food but would never come because they didnt want to smell like smoke for the next seven days were now an option for all those people Nor does Douville worry about noise complaints like Walker does No court is gonna label a bar a nuisance after the city has rati ed a smoking ban that requires you to go outside he says I want to see a judge reconcile no loitering with no smoking inside Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell who introduced and pushed the ban disagrees The responsibility is on the barowner to keep their clientele respectful outside their establishment as well she says The owners and bartenders need to tell them to go have a smoke but be respectful to their communities The idea that we cant have clean air because it will cause noise problems is ridiculous It can be a winwin I think its about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses Cantrell does acknowledge the citys uniqueness in terms of a smoking ban How is New Orleans different from the rest of the country New Orleans is known as the City that Care Forgot she says New Orleans needs to stand up and say We care about our people The most vulnerable people who are working in smoky conditions these citizens are the backbone of our hospitality industry which drives the economy in the state of Louisiana She adds New Orleans is also unlike other places because you do have the option of taking your drink outside with you when you go out to smoke Many worried that the already strained New Orleans Police Department didnt need any part in policing smokers So the health department will handle bar warnings and nes Bar customers are encouraged to come ll out a form or call 311 and to include dateandtimestamped photographs documenting illegal smoking For this reason alone Neil Timms says hell comply with the ban I dont want someone to be sitting in the corner smoking and someone takes a photo of em and gets beaten up Unworried Geoff Douville says that hes used to noise complaints by now so bring on the ban Watch the nosy neighbours who complain about the noise now are gonna be the same ones who wanted the smoking ban to begin with In the end Douville shares Cantrells winwin optimism Of course theyre gonna complain he accepts But it doesnt mean theyre gonna win,It is no longer legal to smoke a cigarette inside a bar in the worlds drinking capital New Orleans Louisiana Since Hurricane Katrina in 2005 New Orleans city government has begun trying to reduce noise problems The city is now stricter on noise in bars and nightclubs and at the same time it has introduced new rules on noise It is the wrong time for this complains barowner William Walker He hates the antismoking law If they force people outside the bar to smoke it is going to increase the tension thats already there Many of New Orleanss best bars are in quiet neighbourhoods Martha Wood lives beside a loud bar that has live music The bar was one reason I bought the house so I wont ever complain about the noise says Wood She also manages a livemusic bar The Maple Leaf club became smokefree in 2014 Another club also became smokefree because performers asked for smokefree nights A lot of the performance venues were already starting to show that consideration to performers I wish the city had just let that happen not force the ban into every bar that doesnt have music says Zalia BeVille manager of the All Ways Lounge Luckily All Ways has an outdoor patio Another bar Lost Love Lounge doesnt have a patio The owner Geoff Douville loves the ban before he felt forced to live with smoke to keep his bar popular I couldnt ban smoking in my bar without a ban in the whole city says Douville People think I have that choice But if I make a nosmoking rule they will choose another bar with smoking Many small business owners also fear that the smokefree rule will make them lose money Neil Timms owns an English pub and saw a smoking ban before in England Back home in England every pub I knew closed because of the smoking ban remembers Timms of Englands ban which began in 2007 To avoid the same problems hes spending money to build a patio But Douville feels the ban could be a great business opportunity There are lots of people who would enjoy coming to our bar but they never came because they didnt want to smell like smoke for the next seven days now those people can come Douville isnt worried about noise complaints No court is going to say a bar is a nuisance after the city has introduced a smoking ban that forces you to go outside he says Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell who introduced the ban disagrees The responsibility is on the barowner to keep their customers respectful outside as well she says The owners need to tell them to go and have a smoke but be respectful to their communities The idea that we cant have clean air because it will cause noise problems is ridiculous We can have clean air without noise problems I think its about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses Many people were worried that the police would not have time to give bars warnings and nes So the health department will do it Bar customers must ll out a form or call 311 and include photographs of illegal smoking Geoff Douville says that hes used to noise complaints You will see the neighbours who complain about the noise now are going to be the same ones who wanted the smoking ban Of course theyre going to complain he adds But it doesnt mean theyre going to

128,Noise emanating from passing ships may disturb animals such as killer whales and dolphins far more than previously thought with new research showing that the animals communication and ability to nd prey could be hampered by the underwater din The low rumble of passing ships has long been connected to the disturbance of large whales But US researchers have documented persistent noise also occurring at medium and higher frequencies including at 20000Hz where killer whales also known as orcas hear best These noise disturbances could be hindering the ability of killer whales to communicate and echolocate the process of using sound to bounce off objects such as prey and identify where they are Dolphins and porpoises which also operate at higher frequencies may be suffering the same problems The ndings suggest that the noise could well affect the endangered population of killer whales that are found near the shipping lanes A population of just 84 killer whales forage up the US west coast and into Puget Sound The main concern relating to this is that even a slight increase in sound may make echolocation more dif cult for whales said Scott Veirs of Beamreach who led the research Thats worrying because their prey chinook salmon is already quite scarce Hearing a click off a salmon is probably one of the most challenging things a killer whale does Hearing that subtle click is harder if theres a lot of noise around you The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise created by about 1600 individual ships as they passed through Haro Strait in Washington State The twoyear study captured the sounds made by 12 different types of vessel including cruise ships container ships and military vehicles that passed through the strait about 20 times a day Some ships are quieter than others but the average intensity of noise next to all the ships was 173 underwater decibels equivalent to 111 decibels through the air about the sound of a loud rock concert Whales are not usually located right next to ships and so would be subjected to noise of about 60 to 90 decibels around the level of a lawnmower or a vacuum cleaner Veirs said scientists have already identi ed the impact of underwater noise upon baleen whales a class of fauna containing the largest animals on Earth But the new research underlines the threat posed to smaller whales dolphins and porpoises Ships have been thought of as low frequency sources of noise like the rumbling of lorries or trains he said Most noise is at that low frequency but the background noise of the ocean is raised even in the high frequencies This could be causing a signi cant problem that we need to look into more There are several knockon consequences of a noisy marine environment Whales may have to group together more closely in order to hear each other And should they fail to nd prey as effectively they will need to use up their stores of excess blubber This is problematic as this blubber often contains manmade pollutants that are toxic to whales if released fully into their systems Veirs said more work needs to be done to identify how badly the noise is affecting whales and also to quieten the ships that pass near the cetaceans It should be easy to reduce noise pollution he said Military ships are quite a bit quieter and there could be straightforward ways of transferring that technology to the commercial eet Another way to reduce noise is to slow down Decreasing speed by six knots could decrease noise intensity by half While the fortunes of some whale species such as humpbacks and blue whales the largest mammal on Earth have improved as whaling has declined others are still under threat from a range of factors The US federal government has recently protected nearly 40000 square miles of the Atlantic in an attempt to avoid losing the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale a species with just 500 individuals left In Europe killer whales are carrying dangerously high levels of banned polychlorinated biphenyl PCB chemicals in their blubber Scientists are still trying to determine whether pollutants caused the deaths of ve sperm whales that became stranded on the east coast of Britain in January 2016 Meanwhile around the coast of Australia whales face an increased threat from ship strikes and oil and gas drilling as well as Japans recent pledge to resume whaling in Antarctic waters,Noise from ships may disturb animals such as killer whales and dolphins much more than we thought before New research shows that underwater noise could stop these animals communicating and make it more dif cult for them to nd food It is well known that noise from ships disturbs large whales But US researchers have found noise also disturbs smaller sea creatures such as killer whales also known as orcas Dolphins and porpoises may have the same problems The main problem is that even a small increase in sound may make it more dif cult for whales to nd food using echo said Scott Veirs who led the research Thats worrying because their food a kind of salmon is already quite scarce Hearing a salmons click is probably one of the most dif cult things a killer whale does It is harder to hear that click if theres a lot of noise around you The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise made by about 1600 ships as they passed through Haro Strait in Washington State USA The twoyear study recorded the sound made by 12 different types of ship including cruise ships container ships and military ships that passed through the strait about 20 times a day Some ships are quieter than others but the average noise next to all the ships was 173 underwater decibels the same as 111 decibels through the air about the sound of a loud rock concert Whales are not usually right next to ships and so would hear noise of about 60 to 90 decibels around the level of a vacuum cleaner Veirs said scientists already knew about the effect of underwater noise on large whales But the new research shows the danger to smaller whales dolphins and porpoises We think that ships make lowfrequency noise like the sound of lorries or trains he said Most noise is at that low frequency but there is more background noise in the high frequencies too This might be causing a big problem that we need to study more Lots of underwater noise can cause many problems Whales may have to stay closer together to hear each other And if they cannot nd food easily they will need to use their extra blubber This is a problem because this blubber often contains manmade pollutants that are poisonous to whales if they get into their bodies Veirs said ships that pass near whales need to be quieter It should be easy to reduce noise pollution he said Military ships are much quieter and there could be simple ways of using that technology on normal ships Another way to reduce noise is to slow down Reducing speed by six knots could decrease noise by half Some whale species are safer now because there is less whaling but other types of whale are still in danger for many different reasons The US has recently protected nearly 40000 square miles of the Atlantic to save a species of whale with just 500 individuals left In Europe killer whales have dangerously high levels of illegal chemicals in their blubber Scientists are still trying to nd out if pollutants caused the deaths of ve whales that were found on beaches on the east coast of Britain in January 2016 And around the coast of Australia whales are in danger from oil and gas drilling as well as Japans recent decision to start whaling again in the seas of Antarctica,validation,ADV,ELE
11,It began with a bogus scallop but a menu scandal that has engulfed some of Japans most prestigious hotels and department stores now threatens to undermine the international reputation of the countrys vaunted cuisine Since one luxury hotel chain admitted lying about the provenance of ingredients on its menus Japanese media have served up almost daily revelations of similar transgressions by restaurants run by wellknown hotels and department stores The frenzy began when the HankyuHanshin hotel chain based in Osaka admitted it had given false descriptions of dozens of menu items at some of its restaurants between 2006 and October 2013 affecting an estimated 78000 diners Among the chief menu misdemeanours was a red salmon caviar dish that turned out to be the less sumptuous eggs of the flying fish A televised attempt by the hotel groups president Hiroshi Desaki to limit the damage by announcing a 20 pay cut for himself and 10 for other executives failed to mollify angry consumers Days later Desaki resigned conceding that the hotel group had betrayed our customers although he added We never had the intention to deceive them One of the hotels head chefs later declined a medal of honour he was due to receive from the government The company has so far refunded more than 10000 consumers to the tune of 20m yen the eventual bill is expected to reach 110m yen Japans version of the UK horsemeat scandal has since spread to several household names in catering While as in the UK no one has fallen ill from eating mislabelled produce the outbreak of anger shows no sign of abating Consumers who believed they had eaten prized kuruma shrimps for example were told they had in fact dined on the much cheaper black tiger version The first incident went almost unnoticed The Prince Hotel in Tokyo was forced to come clean after a diner complained in a blogpost that a scallop dish he had ordered contained a similar but cheaper type of shellfish The hotel launched an investigation and went on to correct more than 50 menu items at dozens of its restaurants Its report scared HankyuHanshin and other hoteliers into admitting that they too had hoodwinked diners who believed they were paying high prices for premium ingredients The Hotel Okura chain whose guests have included Barack Obama confessed myriad sins including injecting beef with fat to make it juicier and incorrectly describing tomatoes as organic We deeply apologize for betraying the expectations and confidence of our clients it said in a statement The list of fraudulent ingredients continues to grow orange juice from cartons sold as freshly squeezed Mont Blanc desserts topped with Korean chestnuts instead of the promised French ones boughtin chocolate cream masquerading as homemade imported beef sold as highend wagyu Even the governments top spokesman Yoshihide Suga was moved to comment on the scandal These incidents have surfaced one after the other and this inappropriate labelling has resulted in the loss of trust among consumers he told reporters These are clearly coverups The fraudulent menu scandal has exploded at just the wrong time Japan is trying to persuade South Korea and other countries to lift bans on food imports imposed in response to the Fukushima nuclear accident while UNESCO is considering a request to add Japanese cuisine to its intangible cultural heritage list One local newspaper ran the headline Japans proud food culture in tears while the mass circulation Yomiuri Shimbun said it was astonished by the industrys lack of morals The newspaper voiced concerns that the scandal could harm the credibility of brand Japan products and services which are praised by foreign countries and tourists for their safety and security Industry experts said the global financial crisis in 2008 had forced luxury hotels to cut costs while attempting to woo diners with detailed menu descriptions Menu descriptions were created to meet consumers preference for brand products and when they couldnt obtain the ingredients stated on the menu hotels just used food from different places of origin Hiroshi Tomozawa a hotel and restaurant consultant told Kyodo News While they count the cost to their reputations the hotels and restaurants involved are unlikely to face legal action Menus are not covered by the agricultural standards law or by a new food labelling law due to go into effect in 2015 The authorities only legal weapon is a law banning misleading representations of goods and services The industrys biggest nemesis will be Japans discerning and demanding consumers In a 2009 poll conducted by an online restaurant guide 72 of respondents said provenance was the most important factor in selecting dishes from a menu followed by calorific and nutritional details,A menu scandal at some of Japans top hotels and department stores is damaging the international reputation of Japanese food One luxury hotel group admitted that it lied about ingredients on its menus Since then there have been similar stories from restaurants run by famous hotels and department stores in Japan The story began when the HankyuHanshin hotel group admitted that it gave false descriptions of menu items at some of its restaurants between 2006 and October 2013 For example the red salmon caviar that customers ordered was in fact the eggs of the flying fish The hotel groups president Hiroshi Desaki went on television to announce a 20 pay cut for himself and 10 for other executives But this did not make customers less angry Days later Desaki resigned he said that the hotel group had betrayed their customers So far the company has refunded 20 million yen to more than 10000 consumers In total they will refund 110 million yen Customers who believed they ate expensive kuruma shrimps were told they in fact ate much cheaper black tiger shrimps complained in a blogpost that a scallop dish he ordered at the Prince Hotel in Tokyo contained a similar but cheaper type of shellfish The hotel investigated the complaint and as a result corrected more than 50 menu items at dozens of its restaurants Its report scared HankyuHanshin and other hoteliers into admitting that they too lied to customers who believed they were paying high prices for top ingredients The Hotel Okura group where Barack Obama has stayed said they also injected beef with fat to make it juicier and incorrectly described tomatoes as organic We apologize for lying to our clients it said The list of fraudulent ingredients gets bigger orange juice from cartons that was sold as freshly squeezed Mont Blanc desserts with Korean chestnuts instead of the French ones on the menu shopbought chocolate cream that the menu said was homemade imported beef sold as expensive wagyu beef The menu scandal has come at the wrong time Japan is trying to persuade South Korea and other countries to start to buy Japanese food again after the Fukushima nuclear accident Food industry experts said the global financial crisis in 2008 forced luxury hotels to save money Menu descriptions were created to sound good to the customers and when hotels couldnt get the ingredients on the menu they just used food from different places Hiroshi Tomozawa a hotel and restaurant consultant told Kyodo News,validation,ADV,ELE
28,In Canadas Arctic summers are marked by a bright light that bathes the treeless tundra for more than 20 hours a day For some its a welcome change from the unrelenting darkness of winter But for the small but growing Muslim community of Iqaluit Nunavut life in the land of the midnight sun poses a real challenge during the month of Ramadan during which Muslims typically fast from sunrise to sunset I havent fainted once said 29yearold Abdul Karim one of the few in the city who has carefully timed his Ramadan fast to the Arctic sun since moving from Ottawa in 2011 This year that means eating at about 130am before the sun rises and breaking his fast at about 11pm when the sun sets The only reason to stop would be if it hurts my health Karim said Pointing to his sizable frame he laughed as he added But looking at my condition I dont think fasting will hurt me As the end of Ramadan draws near for Muslims around the world much of the holy months focus on community work prayer and reflection has been a constant in communities around the world But in Iqaluit and the other Muslim communities in the Arctic the long days have forced a shift in how the element of fasting is approached Most in Iqaluit adhere to the timetable followed by Muslims in Ottawa some 1300 miles south of the city following the advice of Muslim scholars who have said Muslims in the far north should observe Ramadan using the timetable of Mecca or the nearest Muslim city It still means fasting for some 18 hours a day said Atif Jilani who moved to Iqaluit from Toronto in 2015 Its long days but more manageable Many in the 100strong community break their fast together gathering in the citys brand new mosque completed in February amid temperatures that dropped as low as 50C with wind chill for nightly suppers As they tuck into traditional foods such as dates and goat or lamb curries the sun shines brightly through the windows Its a scene that plays out across Canadas northernmost mosques during Ramadan as Muslim communities wrestle with the countrys unique geography The 300 or so Muslims in Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories have several options when it comes to fasting during Ramadan said Nazim Awan president of the Yellowknife Islamic Centre with exceptions made for those who are pregnant or ill There might be some superhumans who want to fast for 23 hours but the other option is to follow the intent and spirit of fasting by following nearby cities or they can follow the times of Mecca and Medina In recent years much of the community has opted to follow the Ramadan timetable of Edmonton in Alberta Some such as Awan a father of two young children including a 12yearold who recently started fasting follow the timings of Mecca He hopes to encourage his son with the more manageable timetable of about 15 hours of fasting as compared with about 18 hours in Edmonton If I fast Yellowknife or Edmonton times my son might say Papa you are really insane What are you doing he said Faced with the impossibility of following the local movements of the sun the 100 or so Muslims in Inuvik a small town that sits 125 miles north of the Arctic Circle have also been following Edmontons timetable We currently have 24 hours a day of sun said Ahmad Alkhalaf Theres no sunrise or sunset The adherence to Edmontons schedule was already in place in 2001 when he moved from Toronto to the small northern community of 3500 people My first Ramadan here was in December Theres no sun at that time its dark all day and night So we used Edmonton time At times it can be psychologically challenging to follow the clock rather than what is happening outside Alkhalaf said Youre supposed to break your fast when its dusk and we eat when the sun is out Its not usual to have iftar the meal breaking the fast when the sun is up he said In Inuvik where much of the population is Inuit the Muslim community has sought to strike a balance between Ramadan and the local culture and traditions The iftar meal includes dates and rich curries as well as local game such as reindeer prepared in accordance with Islamic law We make a soup or curry but instead of using beef we use reindeer In Iqaluit as the Muslim community prepares to mark the end of Ramadan some reflect that 2016s timing stretching across some of the longest days of the year has made it one of the more challenging of recent years Its particularly true for those like Karim who have determinedly followed the local sunrise and sunset But his efforts will be rewarded years from now said Karim thanks to the lunar calendar Ramadan will eventually fall during winter which in Iqaluit sees the sun rise and set within a few hours each day Ill follow those hours too he said with a laugh Oh yes definitely,In summer in the Arctic regions of Canada the sun shines for more than 20 hours a day Some people enjoy this after the constant darkness of winter But for the small Muslim community of Iqaluit life in the land of the midnight sun is a real challenge during the month of Ramadan when Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset I havent fainted once said 29yearold Abdul Karim one of only a few Muslims in the area who has carefully timed his Ramadan fast to the Arctic sun This year that means he eats at about 130am before the sun rises and breaks his fast at about 11pm when the sun sets I would only stop if it hurt my health Karim said Most Muslims in Iqaluit follow the timetable that Muslims in Ottawa about 1300 miles south follow This follows the advice of Muslim scholars who have said Muslims in the far north should observe Ramadan using the timetable of Mecca or the nearest Muslim city They still have to fast for around 18 hours a day said Atif Jilani who moved to Iqaluit from Toronto The days are long but we can do it Its a similar situation in all of Canadas most northern mosques during Ramadan where Muslims have to live with very long or very short days In recent years much of the community has chosen to follow the Ramadan timetable of Edmonton in Alberta Some follow the timetable of Mecca for example Awan a father of two young children including a 12yearold who recently started fasting He hopes that the easier timetable will encourage his son it means about 15 hours of fasting not 18 hours like in Edmonton If I fast Edmonton times my son might say Papa you are really insane What are you doing he said For the 100 Muslims in Inuvik a small town 125 miles north of the Arctic Circle it is impossible to follow the local movements of the sun They also follow Edmontons timetable We currently have 24 hours a day of sun said Ahmad Alkhalaf Theres no sunrise or sunset People already followed the Edmonton timetable in 2001 when he moved from Toronto to the small northern town of 3500 people My first Ramadan here was in December Theres no sun at that time its dark all day and night So we used Edmonton time Sometimes it can be difficult to follow the clock and not the sun Alkhalaf said We should break our fast when its dusk but we eat when the sun is up Its not usual to have iftar the meal that breaks the fast when the sun is up he said In Inuvik where most of the population is Inuit the Muslim community has tried to find a balance between Ramadan and the local culture and traditions The iftar meal includes curries and also local meat such as reindeer We make a soup or curry but we dont use beef we use reindeer In Iqaluit this Ramadan has been one of the most difficult of recent years because it includes some of the longest days of the year Its particularly true for people like Karim who have followed the local sunrise and sunset carefully But it will be easier for him to fast in future years he says thanks to the lunar calendar Ramadan will then fall during winter and in Iqaluit the sun will rise and set within a few hours each day Ill follow those hours too he said with a laugh Oh yes,validation,ADV,ELE
143,The sight of colleagues and acquaintances taking a drag on an ecigarette has become commonplace But have we reached peak vape Statistics suggest that vaping among smokers and recent exsmokers who comprise the vast majority of vapers may already be on the decline The gures will be studied closely by the major ecigarette rms which have poured millions into promoting a technology that was thought to have been growing in popularity Figures released in 2014 by the health charity Action on Smoking and Health ASH reveal that usage among adults in Britain of electronic cigarettes which do not contain tobacco and produce vapour not smoke tripled from an estimated 700000 users in 2012 to 21 million in 2014 However gures collated by the Smoking Toolkit Study a research body backed by the Department of Health that provides quarterly updates on smoking trends show vapings appeal may be waning Vaping rates among smokers and exsmokers rose steadily until the end of 2013 when some 22 of smokers and exsmokers were vaping But this proportion levelled out throughout 2014 before dropping to 19 during the nal quarter of 2014 Early signs suggest the decline has continued into 2015 The drop is described as statistically signi cant by Professor Robert West of UCLs Department of Epidemiology and Public Health who collates the gures for the Toolkit Smokers are the key group for ecigarette rms because seven out of ten vapers are smokers Only around 1 of people who have never smoked have tried an electronic cigarette Numbers who use ecigarettes while continuing to smoke are going down West said Weve only been tracking vaping for just over a year so its a short time period but we are not seeing growth in the number of longterm exsmokers or never smokers using ecigarettes That is not to say vaping rates might not change but at this stage it looks like theyre staying the same The levelling off in popularity of vaping in the UK would appear to be at odds with what is happening in the US where the technology has been promoted aggressively and where recent reports suggested it was growing in popularity However West questioned the interpretation of US data which made little distinction between people who had once tried an ecigarette and those who regularly vaped Fears that vaping could become fashionable among young nonsmokers appear to be misplaced according to experts Only 18 of children are regular users the ASH study found Instead ecigarettes seem to be most popular among adults seeking to quit While the gures published this month by Smoking In England show that the use of electronic cigarettes by smokers has levelled off their data also shows the huge increase in use since May 2011 said James Dunworth director and cofounder of ecigarettedirectcouk Our customers are still very happy with the product and technology and innovation in hardware is improving user experience and helping them to switch from traditional cigarettes Ecigarettes are behaving like a soupedup nicotine patch West agreed They are more popular than nicotine patches and may or may not be more effective Onethird of quit attempts use ecigarettes which makes them by far the most popular method of stopping Hazel Cheeseman director of policy at ASH said it was too soon to say whether vaping had peaked Although there are indications that the market hasnt grown in the UK for about a year there doesnt seem to be a decline in the number of people using electronic cigarettes to help them quit smoking Using an electronic cigarette is safer than smoking some but not all people nd them useful to help quit smoking and there is little evidence that they are leading to an increase in young people smoking It emerged recently that the European Commission EC is looking at increasing taxes on ecigarettes something that could have an impact on their popularity A new EC tobacco directive comes into force in 2016 that will limit the amount of nicotine in ecigarettes to below their current levels This may mean vapers will have to increase their usage to obtain the same hit again something that may make ecigarettes more expensive West suggested that policymakers should see ecigarettes as a smoking cessation aid and not subject them to the same regulations as smoking There is a tendency among some local authorities and organizations to treat ecigarettes as cigarettes and ban them in public places and outdoors he said The problem is that brings public health into disrepute It just sounds like youre having a go at vapers and hitting everyone with a sledgehammer and that undermines the public health messages were trying to get out We have to be careful not to stigmatize ecigarettes,You probably know a vaper someone who smokes ecigarettes But has vaping started to become less popular Statistics suggest that smokers and recent exsmokers the majority of vapers may already be using ecigarettes less The big ecigarette companies will study the figures carefully because they have spent millions of pounds on a technology that they thought was becoming more popular Ecigarettes do not contain tobacco and produce vapour not smoke In 2014 the health charity Action on Smoking and Health published figures that showed that the number of British users of electronic cigarettes has increased three times from 700000 users in 2012 to 21 million in 2014 But figures from the Smoking Toolkit Study show vaping may be becoming less popular The number of vapers who are smokers and ex smokers rose until the end of 2013 when 22 of smokers and exsmokers were vaping But this percentage stopped rising in 2014 Then it dropped to 19 at the end of the year Professor Robert West who collected the data for the Toolkit described the figures as statistically important Smokers are the key group for ecigarette companies because seven out of ten vapers are smokers Only around 1 of people who have never smoked have tried an electronic cigarette The number of people who use ecigarettes while continuing to smoke is going down West said Weve only been studying vaping for just over a year so its a short time period but we are not seeing growth in the number of longterm exsmokers or never smokers using ecigarettes The number of people vaping might change but at the moment it looks like its staying the same Experts believe that vaping will probably not become fashionable with young nonsmokers Only 18 of children are regular ecigarette users But ecigarettes seem to be most popular with adults who want to quit The figures published this month show that the use of electronic cigarettes by smokers has stopped rising But the figures also show the huge increase in use since May 2011 said James Dunworth of ecigarettedirectcouk Our customers are still very happy with the product and technology is improving their experience and helping them to switch from traditional cigarettes Ecigarettes are like a sort of nicotine patch West agreed They are more popular than nicotine patches but we do not know if they are more effective Onethird of people who want to quit smoking use ecigarettes They are the most popular method of stopping The European Commission EC wants to increase taxes on ecigarettes which could make them less popular A new EC tobacco directive becomes law in 2016 It will limit the amount of nicotine in ecigarettes to below their current levels This may mean vapers will have to increase the number they smoke to get the same effect This is another thing that may make ecigarettes more expensive West suggested that politicians should see ecigarettes as something that helps people stop smoking He doesnt think they should follow the same laws as smoking Some local authorities and organizations treat ecigarettes like cigarettes they ban them in public places and outdoors he said He thinks we should support vapers not attack them,validation,ADV,ELE
