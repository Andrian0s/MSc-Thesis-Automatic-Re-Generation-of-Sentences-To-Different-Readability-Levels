18,He is not the first person to express scepticism about Mars One a vastly ambitious private mission aiming to settle humans on Mars from 2025 But Joseph Roche is different from most critics hes on the shortlist of astronauts Roche an astrophysicist at Trinity College Dublin who was announced in February as among the 100 people in line for the mission has written for the Guardian expressing his grave doubts about the viability of Mars One The selection process Roche writes was not rigorous enough to reach the requisite standard of more traditional astronaut selection programmes He also says the Dutch Mars One team have displayed a certain naivety in believing they can succeed alone in the supposed 6bn mission and should now accept it is very unlikely to happen He writes More openness and transparency would benefit Mars One greatly but I think that the shortcomings of the selection process coupled with their unwillingness to engage and collaborate with the scientific community mean that the time might have come for Mars One to acknowledge the implausibility of this particular venture and turn their efforts towards supporting other exciting and more viable upcoming space missions Roche also expressed worries about the way the mission organizers publicized a socalled topten candidates The ranking he said didnt mean these were the most likely potential astronauts but was instead based on how many supporter points each had earned through acts such as buying official merchandise He writes These points are Mars Ones supporter points which represent the degree of your support to Mars Ones mission These points play no role in the selection process and serve only to show how much each supporter has donated to Mars One The official timeline for the mission says the group plans to dispatch a stationary lander and satellite to Mars in 2018 followed by a rover in 2020 and cargo missions starting in 2022 Humans would start arriving in 2025 and crews of four would be sent every two years to add to the settlement They would not return to Earth In February a prominent supporter of the project Gerard t Hooft a Dutch Nobel laureate in physics said he did not believe this timetable was realistic He said It will take quite a bit longer and be quite a bit more expensive When they first asked me to be involved I told them You have to put a zero after everything Roche also spoke to Medium a US blogging platform that has previously expressed grave sceptism about Mars One reporting among other things that the supposed 200000 applications to be astronauts in fact totalled 2761 He told Medium about the selection process in more detail I have not met anyone from Mars One in person Initially theyd said there were going to be regional interviews we would travel there wed be interviewed wed be tested over several days and in my mind that sounded at least like something that approached a legitimate astronaut selection process But then they made us sign a nondisclosure agreement if we wanted to be interviewed and then all of a sudden it changed from being a proper regional interview over several days to being a tenminute Skype call Roche told the Guardian he did not want to give more interviews as he was wary about being negative about the idea of space travel In his comment piece he writes I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of scientific endeavour and that is why the ambitiousness of the Mars One plan appealed to me Although Mars One were never likely to overcome the financial and technical barriers during their proposed timeline it was refreshing to hear a new idea that challenges us to think about our own role in the future of space exploration Being part of the subsequent public debate over the ethics and morality of future missions has been one of the most interesting and enjoyable aspects of my candidacy with Mars One If a oneway mission to Mars ever became possible then I would always volunteer For an astrophysicist that is not a difficult decision to make but it is also a moot point because I do not think we will see a oneway mission in my lifetime,Joseph Roche is on the shortlist of astronauts for Mars One a private mission that plans to send humans to live on Mars from 2025 He is on the shortlist but he is sceptical about Mars One Roche is an astrophysicist at Trinity College Dublin He is one of the 100 people on the shortlist for the mission He has doubts about Mars One The selection process Roche says did not reach the standard of more traditional astronaut selection processes He also says the Dutch Mars One team are naive because they believe they can succeed alone in the 6 billion mission He says they should now accept it will probably not happen The group plans to send a lander and satellite to Mars in 2018 followed by a rover in 2020 and cargo missions starting in 2022 Humans will start arriving in 2025 and they will send more crews of four people every two years The astronauts will not return to Earth Gerard t Hooft is a Dutch Nobel laureate in physics He is a supporter of the project but he says he does not believe the Mars One plans are realistic He said It will take longer and be more expensive When they asked me to be involved I told them You have to put a zero after everything Roche also said that there were not 200000 people who applied to be astronauts as Mars One said there were only 2761 He talked about the selection process in more detail I have not met anyone from Mars One At first they said there would be regional interviews we would travel there and they would interview and test us over several days To me that sounded like a proper astronaut selection process But it changed from a proper regional interview over several days to a tenminute Skype call Roche says he does not want to give more interviews because he doesnt want to sound negative about space travel He said that being involved in the public debate about future missions is one of the most interesting and enjoyable things about his connection with Mars One He then said that If a oneway mission to Mars ever became possible I would always volunteer For an astrophysicist that is not a

105,He had the tastes of a typical millionaire He owned a gold and silver Rolex and a fleet of expensive cars He liked to dabble in modern art But although this Chinese businessman had several companies and a palatial villa in the Madrid suburbs he had almost no money in the bank a detail that piqued the interest of Spanish authorities Gao Ping who had lived most of his adult life in Spain had a monopoly on supplies to 4000 Chinese bazaars across the Mediterranean country But authorities suspected he was not paying taxes on the clothes furniture and other goods he was importing from China When police swooped on his warehouses in 2012 they found piles of cash wads of 100 200 and 500 notes were wrapped in elastic bands Around 12m was wheeled away in trolleys the largest ever cash seizure by Spanish police The gang with Gao the alleged ringleader stands accused of laundering up to 300m a year as well as selling counterfeit goods and toys with fake safety marks The government prosecutor said Gaos illegal business was so big it was damaging the competitiveness of Spain Gao is on bail the case has not yet come to trial Law enforcement officials have long had concerns about 500 notes Small and easy to transport relative to their value they are the payment method of choice for tax dodgers money launderers and drug barons The sum of 1m in 500 notes fits easily into a small laptop bag where the same amount in 50 notes would require a small suitcase Cash mules have been known to fold the notes into plastic pellets and swallow them A less dangerous method of concealment is to stuff the banknotes into a car chassis The UK stopped distribution of the 500 note in 2010 on the grounds that demand for it was almost entirely for criminal purposes In 2009 Italys central bank warned that the notes were widely used by mafia money launderers and terrorists Other countries have limited their own highdenomination notes due to links to organized crime Canada scrapped its 1000 note in 2000 on the advice of law enforcement officers In an age of electronic payment systems and contactless cards more are questioning whether printing these notes can be justified Peter Sands the former head of Standard Chartered Bank has called for the abolition of highdenomination notes including the 500 the 100 the 1000 Swiss Franc note and the 50 In a report for the Harvard Kennedy School of Government Sands argued it was time to get rid of highvalue notes that make life easier for bad guys pursuing tax evasion financial crime terrorist finance and corruption Although criminals would switch to smallerdenomination bills or gold or diamonds these substitutes are bulkier and more traceable making it more likely they will get caught he said At a conference on terrorist financing in London the Head of Europol Rob Wainwright called on the European Central Bank ECB to look at whether it should continue to produce and circulate these notes that make it easier for criminals and terrorists to hide their business and to fund illegal activities According to Europol the purple 500 note accounts for 30 of the value of all the euro notes in circulation although most people have never seen one The 500 note was introduced in 2002 when the euro was born it replaced the 1000 Deutschmark the 10000 Belgian franc and the 500000 Italian lira Several European countries favoured highvalue banknotes It is definitely a preference that has been there for a long time says Pia Httl an affiliate fellow at the Bruegel thinktank The preference is based on the idea that cash has a lower cost and is accepted everywhere Cash remains king in Germany and Austria where more than half of all transactions are made with paper money and coins The former president of Germanys constitutional court HansJrgen Papier told Germanys Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that restrictions on cash were at odds with individual freedom while tabloid newspaper Bild has launched a petition in defence of paper money including the 500 note hands off my cash Law enforcement authorities are less convinced amid a steady stream of reports of suspicious bundles of cash In one case that has caught the attention of police two men walked into a bank and tried to deposit 200000 of torn and muddy 500 notes In the same week 13m in 500 notes was found stuffed in the false bottom of suitcase But a suspicion of criminality is not enough to keep people in custody Our frustration from a law enforcement perspective is that in many jurisdictions it is impossible to provide sufficient evidence to satisfy judicial authorities of a link between suspicious cash detections and criminality says Jennifer MacLeod a specialist in Europols financial intelligence group The search for these links is complicated further through time constraints and fragmented cooperation and information exchange The agency would like to see central banks take more responsibility for the striking anomalies in the use of 500 notes Luxembourg for example issued more than twice its annual GDP in banknotes in 2013 alone despite being one of the most cashaverse countries in Europe Europol asked Luxembourgs central bank to explain The reply we had from Luxembourg is that they simply issue the notes requested and have no explanation for the reasons behind the demand MacLeod says I find it surprising that a central bank does not consider itself to have a responsibility in this area This could be changing Mario Draghi the head of the ECB has said he is determined that the income the bank generates from issuing the notes should not be a comfort for criminals Other members of the ECBs top team such as Yves Mersch contend there is no evidence about the criminal uses of the 500 note But amid heightened fears about terrorism this argument may no longer cut any ice EU finance ministers have called on policymakers to explore appropriate restrictions on highvalue notes and report back by 1 May 2016,He was a normal millionaire He had a gold and silver Rolex watch and lots of expensive cars He liked to buy modern art This Chinese businessman had many companies and a large villa in Madrid But he had

asking why it is still necessary to have these banknotes Peter Sands the former head of Standard Chartered Bank said we should get rid of large notes including the 500 the 100 the 1000 Swiss Franc note and the 50 Sands said it was time to get rid of highvalue notes that make life easier for bad guys Criminals would instead use smaller banknotes or gold or diamonds but these are big so criminals cannot carry them easily he said The purple 500 note was introduced in 2002 it replaced the 1000 Deutschmark the 10000 Belgian franc and the 500000 Italian lira In Germany and Austria people still pay

3,Brazils latest funk sensation Anitta has won millions of fans by taking the favela sound into the mainstream but she is at the centre of a debate about skin colour Antidiscrimination campaigners and social commentators say the music industrys fastest rising star has had to sacrifice her blackness to make it into the predominantly white middleclass market The controversy was prompted by the publication of thenandnow photographs that show a dramatic lightening of Anittas skin tone since she signed a deal with Warner In the first when she was relatively unknown she looked darker In the second a marketing shot after she became famous she seems paler Whether this was the result of whitening products and cosmetic surgery or more likely Photoshop tweaks the contrast has rekindled discussion about whether you need to be pale to get ahead in Brazil Jarid Arraes a psychology student and blogger wrote a post criticizing the latent discrimination in media and marketing that she felt Anittas image change represented People refuse to accept that they are racist and they think they live in a multiracial democracy but the statistics show that is far from the case The whitening shows us a profoundly intolerant society that doesnt support diversity White is the image of the rich the nice the successful the good while people see black as the opposite of all that Born Larissa de Macedo Machado the divatobe was a church chorister in her childhood In her teens she made a name for herself in Rio de Janeiros baile funk scene as a dancer and singer She has now exploded into the public consciousness with an album and a huge hit single Show das Poderosas which topped the charts and attracted 52 million YouTube views Though adored first and foremost as a pop idol with a strong message and some catchy tunes her backers project her as a cultural bridge between the predominantly black and mixedrace shanty towns on Rios hillsides and the wealthier and whiter communities below She has toned down the suggestive dancing gangsta references and explicit lyrics of baile funk Now however questions are being asked about whether she or her marketing team have gone too far in retailoring her image to attract a more lucrative demographic If pop stars have curly hair they are going to feel coerced into straightening it If they have a big nose they will be coerced into getting rhinoplasty said Arraes It creates a vicious cycle for selfesteem This is a sensitive topic in this largely mixedraced nation Brazil one of the last big countries in the world to ban slavery has the largest population of African descent outside Africa but race and ancestry are less important here than colour And despite the nations goal of being a multiracial democracy there is a clear link between skin tone and inequality In Brazilian cities white workers earn roughly twice as much as those of African descent Up until 2011 black or mixedrace students also spent two years less at school on average The government says the gap is closing thanks to quota systems for university places and other forms of affirmative action But the gulf remains glaringly apparent The vast majority of business and government executives are white while most menial jobs are done by black and mixedrace workers Walk through Ipanema Gvea or other upmarket districts and you are far more likely to see black nannies pushing strollers with white toddlers than a white nanny pushing a black child Defining colour is complex People who define themselves as white were in the minority for the first time in the most recent census in 2010 Among the 197 million population 82 million said they were pardu mixed race 15 million black two million Asian and 05 indigenous Sylvio Ferreira a psychology lecturer at the Federal University of Pernambuco believes Anitta has won the hearts of the middle class by taking a rebellious sound and making it tamer and more palatable to everyone Was this achieved by racial whitening No he said What happened was a change of the social space where Anitta produced her art from the periphery to the centre Others agree that the issue of colour is overblown Maycon de Mattos Batista a financial analyst who worked with Anitta while she was an intern said there had been a huge change in Anittas image but not of her colour I dont believe its whitening its more the way they are producing her with makeup hairstylists and the way she dresses he said I dont think that was because of pressure being put on her She always liked to show off sing and dance That was a natural thing for her I believe that it is because of this naturalness that she is where she is today Leandro Silva de Souza a racial equality activist in the northeastern city of Salvador said the prejudice lay not with society but with music producers and media executives The public he said proved they were interested in music for its own sake by choosing Ellen Olria a black lesbian as the recent winner of the talent show The Voice Brazil The Guardian was unable to reach Anitta for comment But in a recent interview she described the need for identity to be selfdefined Allpowerful is a woman who doesnt need to be beautiful but she has so much attitude that she is marvellous she is powerful What I try to pass on in my work for everyone is that we can be who we want,Anitta a music star from Brazil has millions of fans but she is at the centre of a debate about skin colour Some people are saying that Anitta had to give up her black skin to be a success in the mostly white middleclass market The debate was started by photographs that show that Anittas skin has got much lighter since she signed a music deal with Warner In the first photo before she was famous she looked darker In the second photo a marketing photo after she became famous she seems lighter The difference has started a discussion about whether you need to have light skin to be a success in Brazil Born Larissa de Macedo Machado the divatobe was a church chorister in her childhood In her teens she made a name for herself in Rio de Janeiros baile funk scene as a dancer and singer She now has an album and a huge hit single Show das Poderosas which was number one in the charts and attracted 52 million YouTube views Many people love her because she is a pop idol with a strong message and some good pop songs Her marketing team want people to see her as a cultural bridge between the poor people living in the mostly black and mixedrace shanty towns on Rios hills and the richer and whiter parts below But now people are asking if she or her marketing team have gone too far and changed her too much This is a sensitive topic in this mixedraced country Brazil has the largest population of African descent outside Africa but race and where your family come from are less important there than colour There is a clear link between skin colour and inequality In Brazilian cities white workers earn twice as much as workers of African descent Up until 2011 black or mixedrace students also spent two years less at school on average Most business and government executives are white but black and mixedrace

4,An octopus has made a brazen escape from the National Aquarium in New Zealand by breaking out of its tank slithering down a 50metre drainpipe and disappearing into the sea In scenes reminiscent of Finding Nemo Inky a common New Zealand octopus made his dash for freedom after the lid of his tank was accidentally left slightly ajar Staff believe that in the middle of the night while the aquarium was deserted Inky clambered to the top of his glass enclosure down the side of the tank and travelled across the floor of the aquarium Rob Yarrell national manager of the National Aquarium of New Zealand in Napier said Octopuses are famous escape artists I dont think he was unhappy with us or lonely as octopuses are solitary creatures But he is such a curious boy He would want to know whats happening on the outside Thats just his personality One theory is that Inky slid across the aquarium floor a journey of three or four metres and then sensing freedom was at hand into a drainpipe that led directly to the sea The drainpipe was 50 metres long and opened onto the waters of Hawkes Bay on the east coast of New Zealands North Island Another possible escape route could have involved Inky squeezing into an open pipe at the top of his tank which led under the floor to the drain When we came in the next morning and his tank was empty I was really surprised said Yarrell who has not launched a search for Inky The staff and I have been pretty sad But then this is Inky and hes always been a bit of a surprise octopus Reiss Jenkinson exhibits keeper at the National Aquarium said he was absolutely certain Inky had not been taken I understand the nature of octopus behaviour very well he said I have seen octopuses on boats slip through bilge pumps And the security here is too tight for anyone to take Inky and why would they Because octopuses have no bones they are able to fit into extremely small spaces and have been filmed squeezing through gaps the size of coins They are also understood to be extremely intelligent and capable of using tools At the Island Bay Marine Education Centre in Wellington an octopus was found to be in the habit of visiting another tank overnight to steal crabs then returning to its own Another at the centre Ozymandias was thought to have broken a world record for opening a jar before it was released into the ocean Inky was brought to the National Aquarium a number of years ago by a local fisherman who found him caught in a crayfish pot He was scarred and rough looking with shortened limbs said Yarrell He had been living on the reef and fighting with fish so he wasnt in the best shape According to Yarrell Inky who is about the size of a rugby ball was an unusually intelligent octopus He was very friendly very inquisitive and a popular attraction here We have another octopus Blotchy but he is smaller than Inky and Inky had the personality The aquarium has no plans to step up security as a result of the escape as Inky was a oneoff but the staff are increasingly aware of what octopuses can actually do Although the aquarium is not actively searching for a replacement for Inky if a fisherman brought in another octopus it might be willing to take it on You never know said Yarrell Theres always a chance Inky could come home to us,An octopus has escaped from the National Aquarium in New Zealand It escaped from its tank slid down a 50metre drainpipe and disappeared into the sea Inky a common New Zealand octopus escaped after someone left the lid of his tank open Staff at the aquarium believe that in the middle of the night when there was noone in the building Inky climbed down the side of the tank and travelled across the floor Rob Yarrell national manager of the National Aquarium of New Zealand in Napier said Octopuses are famous for their ability to escape I dont think he was unhappy with us or lonely because octopuses like to live alone But he is such a curious boy He would want to know whats happening on the outside Thats his personality One idea is that Inky crossed the aquarium floor a journey of three or four metres and then he realized that freedom was very near so he entered a drainpipe that led directly to the sea The drainpipe was 50 metres long and opened into Hawkes Bay on the east coast of New Zealands North Island It is also possible that Inky escaped through an open pipe at the top of his tank which led under the floor to the drain When we came in the next morning and his tank was empty I was really surprised said Yarrell who has not started looking for Inky The staff and I have been sad But then this is Inky and hes always been a bit of a surprise octopus Reiss Jenkinson a keeper at the National Aquarium said he was absolutely certain Inky was not stolen I understand octopus behaviour very well he said I have seen octopuses on boats escape through waste pumps And the security here is too good for anyone to take Inky and why would they Because octopuses have no bones they can fit into very small spaces and can squeeze through gaps the size of coins They are also very intelligent and able to use tools At the Island Bay Marine Education Centre in Wellington an octopus visited another tank every night to steal crabs then return to its own tank Another octopus at the centre Ozymandias broke a world record for opening a jar Inky was brought to the National Aquarium several years ago by a local fisherman who found him in a fishing pot Yarrell said He lived on the reef and fought with fish so he was quite ill According to Yarrell Inky who is about the size of a rugby ball was an unusually intelligent octopus He was very friendly and a popular attraction here We have another octopus Blotchy but he is smaller than Inky and Inky had the personality The aquarium has no plans to increase security as a result of the escape but the staff now know what octopuses can do so they will be more careful The aquarium is not looking for another octopus but if a fisherman brought in another octopus the aquarium might take it You never know said Yarrell Theres always a chance Inky will come home to us,validation,ADV,ELE
150,Organic food has more of the antioxidant compounds linked to better health than regular food and lower levels of toxic metals and pesticides according to the most comprehensive scienti c analysis to date The international team behind the work suggests that switching to organic fruit and vegetables could give the same bene ts as adding one or two portions of the recommended ve a day The team led by Professor Carlo Leifert at Newcastle University concludes that there are statistically signi cant meaningful differences with a range of antioxidants being substantially higher between 19 and 69 in organic food It is the rst study to demonstrate clear and wideranging differences between organic and conventional fruits vegetables and cereals The researchers say the increased levels of antioxidants are equivalent to one to two of the ve portions of fruits and vegetables recommended to be consumed daily and would therefore be signi cant and meaningful in terms of human nutrition if information linking these compounds to the health bene ts associated with increased fruit vegetable and wholegrain consumption is con rmed The ndings will add to the controversy over organic food and whether it is better for people with one expert saying that the ndings were exaggerated Tom Sanders a professor of nutrition at Kings College London said the research did show some differences But the question is are they within natural variation And are they nutritionally relevant I am not convinced He said Leiferts work had caused controversy in the past Leifert has had a lot of disagreements with a lot of people Sanders added the research showed organic cereals have less protein than conventional crops The results of the research are based on an analysis of 343 peerreviewed studies from around the world more than ever before which examine differences between organic and conventional fruit vegetables and cereals The crucially important thing about this research is that it shatters the myth that how we farm does not affect the quality of the food we eat said Helen Browning chief executive of the Soil Association which campaigns for organic farming Plants produce many of their antioxidant compounds to ght back against pest attacks so the higher levels in organic crops may result from their lack of protection by chemical sprays But the scientists say other reasons may be important such as organic varieties being bred for toughness and not being overfed with arti cial fertilizers Leifert and his colleagues conclude that many antioxidants have previously been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases including cardiovascular diseases neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers But they also note that no longterm studies showing health bene ts from a broad organic diet have yet been conducted The researchers found much higher levels of cadmium a toxic metal in conventional crops Pesticide residues were found on conventional crops four times more often than on organic food The research was funded by the EU and an organic farming charity The research is certain to be criticized the inclusion of so many studies in the analysis could mean poorquality work skews the results although the team did sensitivity analyses and found that excluding weaker work did not signi cantly change the outcome Also the higher levels of cadmium and pesticides in conventional produce were still well below regulatory limits But the researchers say cadmium accumulates over time in the body and that some people may wish to avoid this and that pesticide limits are set individually not for the cocktail of chemicals used on crops A further criticism is that the differences seen may result from different climates soil types and crop varieties and not from organic farming though the researchers argue that combining many studies should average out these other differences The greatest criticism however will be over the suggestions of potential health bene ts The most recent major analysis which took in 223 studies in 2012 found little evidence The published literature lacks strong evidence that organic foods are signi cantly more nutritious than conventional foods it found This was also the conclusion of earlier smaller studies published in 2009 in a scienti c journal and by the UK Food Standards Agency though the latter considered just 11 studies The 2012 study did note that eating organic food might help people avoid pesticide residues Sanders said he was not persuaded by the new work You are not going to be better nourished if you eat organic food he said What is most important is what you eat not whether its organic or conventional Its whether you eat fruit and vegetables at all People are buying into a lifestyle system They get an assurance it is not being grown with chemicals and is not grown by big business Opinion polls show healthy eating 55 and avoiding chemical residues 53 are key reasons cited by shoppers for buying organic produce But many also say care for the environment 44 and animal welfare 31 are important as is taste 35 Browning said This research backs up what people think about organic food In other countries there have long been much higher levels of support and acceptance of the bene ts of organic food and farming We hope these ndings will bring the UK into line with the rest of Europe,According to a recent scienti c study organic food has more healthy antioxidants than regular food It also has fewer toxic metals and pesticides The international team that did the study suggests that changing to organic fruit and vegetables could be as healthy as adding one or two portions of the recommended ve a day fruit and vegetables The team led by Professor Carlo Leifert concludes that there are big differences between organic and nonorganic food Organic food has between 19 and 69 more antioxidants It is the rst study to show clear differences between organic and regular fruits vegetables and cereals The researchers say that the higher levels of antioxidants have the same effect as one to two of the ve portions of fruits and vegetables that people should eat every day They say this means that organic food is better for our health The ndings will make people argue even more about whether or not organic food is better for people Tom Sanders a professor of nutrition at Kings College London said the research showed some differences But are the differences relevant I am not sure He also said that research showed organic cereals have less protein than regular crops The results of the research are based on an analysis of 343 studies from around the world more than ever before which examine differences between organic and regular fruit vegetables and cereals Helen Browning who supports organic farming said that the research showed that how we farm affects the quality of the food we eat Leifert and his colleagues conclude that many antioxidants reduce the risk of serious diseases including diseases of the heart and certain cancers The researchers also found much higher levels of cadmium a toxic metal in regular crops They found four times more pesticides on regular crops than on organic food People will criticize the research including so many studies in the analysis could make the results unreliable Also the higher levels of cadmium and pesticides in regular food are still below recommended limits But the researchers say that cadmium stays in the body and that some people may want to avoid this They also say that recommended limits are for single pesticides and not for the mixture of chemicals that farmers use on regular crops Another criticism of the research is that the differences it found may be the result of different climates different types of soil and different types of crops they may not be the result of organic farming But the biggest criticism will be about possible health bene ts The most recent major analysis which included 223 studies in 2012 found little evidence of health bene ts Other studies did not nd evidence that organic foods are much more nutritious than regular foods it found Sanders agrees You are not going to be healthier if you eat organic food he said What is most important is what you eat not whether its organic or regular Its whether you eat fruit and vegetables at all Shoppers say that healthy eating 55 and avoiding chemicals 53 are the main reasons they buy organic food Browning said This research supports what people think about organic food In other countries there is much more support and acceptance of the bene ts of organic food and farming We hope that now the UK will accept organic food like people in the rest of Europe,validation,ADV,ELE
108,The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge won the first round in their battle for privacy on Tuesday when a French magazine was banned from selling or reusing images taken of the couple at a private chateau in Provence But the war is far from over as French prosecutors must now decide if criminal proceedings are to be brought against the magazine editor and the photographer or photographers responsible for taking pictures of the duchess sunbathing topless while on holiday in the south of France The Tribunal de Grande Instance in Nanterre Paris granted an injunction ordering the gossip magazine Closer to hand over digital files of the pictures within 24 hours and preventing it disseminating them any further including on its website and tablet app The fourpage ruling which only affects Mondadori Magazines France Closers publisher also ordered it to pay 2000 in legal costs The magazine faces a 10000 fine for every day it fails to comply with the order No damages were sought by the couple These snapshots which showed the intimacy of a couple partially naked on the terrace of a private home surrounded by a park several hundred metres from a public road and being able to legitimately assume that they are protected from passersby are by nature particularly intrusive it said The magistrates ruled that every photograph published in France by Mondadori the publishing company owned by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in future would carry a fine also of 10000 per breach But the ruling refers only to the 14 pictures that have already been published Closers editor has hinted she has other more intimate pictures St Jamess Palace said the couple welcome the judges ruling A source said They always believed the law was broken and that they were entitled to their privacy Maud Sobel a lawyer for the royal couple in Paris described it as a wonderful decision adding Weve been vindicated Though pleased their civil action has succeeded the couple have taken the rare step of seeking to have a much more public criminal prosecution for breach of privacy brought against the magazine and photographer or photographers responsible The prosecutor will have to decide the targets for any criminal proceedings and the complaint cites persons unknown But it is understood the couple want proceedings brought against the editor of Closer which published the photos on Friday and whoever took the images of the couple sunbathing at the chateau which belongs to Lord Linley son of the late Princess Margaret A preliminary investigation was launched on Tuesday by the Paris police Under French law breach of privacy carries a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a fine of 45000 This is the legal action that will truly lay down a marker and by pursuing it the couple indicate a determination to convey a wider message to the world and they hope deter paparazzi in the future Their lawyers had not asked for copies of Closer magazine to be removed from shelves On Saturday the Irish Daily Star published the photos leading to the editor being suspended on Monday night pending the outcome of an internal investigation Also on Monday the Mondadoriowned Italian celebrity magazine Chi rushed out a special edition with 26 pages devoted to the candid photos of the future queen The couples lawyer Aurlien Hamelle had told the Paris court it was necessary to block the highly intimate images of the duchess without her bikini top as she was a young woman not an object But Delphine Pando defending Closer said the action was a disproportionate response to publication of the photographs She added that the magazine could not control their resale as it did not own the original images Copies of Closer magazine were doing brisk business on online auction site eBay with one selling for 3101 until the site removed all listings following strong feedback from its community,The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have won the first part of their fight for privacy A French magazine was told to stop selling or reusing photos of the royal couple The pictures show the duchess sunbathing topless while on holiday in the south of France It is possible that the magazine editor and the photographer or photographers will also have to go to a criminal court The French magazine Closer was told to give digital files of the pictures to the couple within 24 hours Closers publisher Mondadori Magazines France was also told to pay 2000 in legal costs The magazine will have to pay 10000 for every day it does not give the couple the files The court decided that every time Mondadori the publishing company owned by the ex Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi publishes a photograph in the future in France they will get 10000 fine The couple welcome the judges decision They always believed the law was broken and that they had a right to their privacy The royal couple are pleased with the decision but they want to have a much more public criminal trial against the magazine and photographer or photographers Under French law if you do not respect someones privacy you may have to spend a maximum of one year in prison and pay a fine of 45000 This punishment would send a message to the world and the couple hope stop paparazzi taking photos like this in the future On Saturday the Irish Daily Star also published the photos And the Italian celebrity magazine Chi published a special edition of 26 pages with the photos of the future queen,validation,ADV,ELE
181,It could be the best thing since Trevor Bayliss windup radio in the preinternet 1990s a cheap light that draws free power from gravity and could end the use of dangerous kerosenefuelled lamps in Africa and India But when British designer Patrick Hunt went down the conventional route of bank or venture capital finance to get his invention kickstarted commercially he hit a problem We tried to get funding to make it happen but its slow and complex and its unproven and nobody wants to take a risk he said So he tried crowdfunding on a US website Indiegogo which had recently opened up in the UK Within five days he had hit his target and raised 36200 So popular was his campaign at the end of 2012 to entice donations from the public that within 40 days he had raised a colossal 400000 The LED light is powered by a dynamo driven by the descent of a 10kg bag of rocks The weight is attached to the light lifted to a height of about 2m and while it is allowed to slowly fall to the ground it will generate enough power for half an hour of light Hunt is preparing for production in China and will test the market again by delivering 1000 of the lights to Africa before the full mass production of what he hopes will be millions of units He is one of a new wave of entrepreneurs turning to the fastgrowing crowdfunding industry for finance Another new site is InvestingZone which matches wealthy individuals with startup entrepreneurs Indiegogo does not offer shares but allows users to offer perks for different levels of donation those helping to fund Hunts innovative light not only got to feel good about helping the less well off but also got their own light For Danae Ringelmann cofounder of Indiegogo the gravity light is a perfect example of how meritocratic crowdfunding can be and how it can test an entrepreneurs idea It is the first time that finance has been fast efficient and meritocratic because it is not about How do I get access to the decision makers in that bank or Who do I know in that venture capital outfit This is all about proving your worth to your customers and fans getting them to validate your idea and fund it Even ideas that arent deemed worthy to get funding are worth testing because you will have saved yourself a whole bunch of time finding out it wasnt a good idea and getting smarter faster she says Ringelmann who is based in the US started her career as a Wall Street analyst In 2008 she decided to quit and use her skills to try and help friends who worked in the arts to raise money The site was originally focused on the film business and launched at the Sundance Film Festival that year Five years on and it is raising about 2m a week for new businesses in startup and growth stages In December 2012 it launched a euro and a sterling service to get a foothold this side of the Atlantic and says Britain is its third biggest market International activity is up 41 since December There is no shortage of competitors be it Kickstarter Seedrs or Funding Circle but unlike rivals says Ringelmann Indiegogo is the only crowdfunder where anyone can launch a campaign No project is deemed too wacky The site levies a 4 fee for successful campaigns For those that fail to raise their target amount users have the option of either refunding all money to their contributors at no charge or keeping all money raised but with a 9 fee A British woman Lauren Pears raised 100000 to open a cat caf in London through the site Known as Lady Dinahs Cat Emporium it is yet to open but is billed as somewhere people can come in from the cold to a comfortable wingback chair a hot cup of tea a book and a cat Weve seen campaigns that go to venture capitalists get rejected because the venture guys say Great idea but no idea if the market actually wants it it could be a gadget that no one cares about said Ringelmann The entrepreneurs do an Indiegogo campaign they dont even actually launch the project but the campaign itself is enough market proof for venture capitalists to say there is a market for this It allows you to test your market test your pricing test your features discover new revenue streams get vital feedback says Ringelmann With her Wall Street background and the experience of helping 100000 businesses and services raise finance Ringelmann has finetuned her advice for the budding entrepreneur Ideas are a dime a dozen Its all about the execution and if you are afraid that your idea will be stolen by someone who could execute it better and faster than you then you are not the right person to execute that idea Its all about confidence to move fast and to learn she says For Ringelmann the expansion into Europe and a deal with a web transaction provider which will allow payments to be made through local card services like Maestro in the UK and Carte Bleue in France as well as PayPal are part of a dream to democratize finance More than 7000 campaigns for finance are live on the site While crowdfunding as an alternative to banks has grown it has limited appeal to bigbucks investors who dont settle for anything less than a stake in a promising business That could start to change in the UK with the launch of InvestingZone,The business idea is to produce a cheap light that gets free power from gravity and could end the use of dangerous kerosene lamps in Africa and India But when British designer Patrick Hunt tried to get money from banks or venture capitalists to help start his business he hit a problem We tried to get funding but its slow and difficult and nobody wants to take a risk he said So he tried crowdfunding on a US website Indiegogo which has recently opened up in the UK Within five days he made 36200 His campaign was so popular that within 40 days he had made 400000 from the public A 10kg bag of rocks is attached to the light lifted to a height of about two metres and while it slowly falls to the ground it makes enough power for half an hour of light Hunt is one of a new group of entrepreneurs who are trying to get money from the fastgrowing crowdfunding industry to start their businesses Another new crowdfunding site is InvestingZone It matches wealthy people with entrepreneurs On Indiegogo users can offer perks for different levels of investment for example people who helped to fund Hunts light could feel good about helping someone who is less rich but they also got one of his lights as a present For Danae Ringelmann who started Indiegogo the gravity light is a perfect example of how crowdfunding can work and how it can test an entrepreneurs idea It is good to test ideas even if they dont get funding because that way you save a lot of time finding out it wasnt a good idea and you can get smarter faster she says Indiegogo started five years ago Now it is making about 2m a week for new businesses In December 2012 it started a European service It says it is very popular in Britain International activity has increased by 41 since December There are other crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter Seedrs and Funding Circle but Indiegogo is the only crowdfunding site where anyone can start a campaign No project is too crazy for Indiegogo The site charges a 4 fee for successful campaigns Entrepreneurs who do not find the amount of money they wanted to find can either pay back all the money or keep all the money but pay a 9 fee A British woman made 100000 to open a cat caf in London through the site It will be called Lady Dinahs Cat Emporium but it is not open yet It will be somewhere people can come in from the cold to a comfortable chair a hot cup of tea a book and a cat With her Wall Street background and the experience of helping 100000 businesses and services find money Ringelmann has good advice for entrepreneurs Ideas are a dime a dozen What is important is how you make your idea happen If you are afraid that someone will steal your idea and that that person will make your idea happen better and faster than you then you are not the right person to make the idea happen Its all about confidence to move fast and to learn she says Crowdfunding as an alternative to banks has grown but at the moment bigbucks investors with lots of money are not very interested That could start to change in the UK when people start using InvestingZone,validation,ADV,ELE
48,A mirror that sends heat into the frigid expanse of space has been designed by scientists to replace airconditioning units that keep buildings cool on Earth Researchers believe the mirror could slash the amount of energy used to control air temperatures in business premises and shopping centres by doing away with powerhungry cooling systems Around 15 of the energy used by buildings in the US goes on air conditioning but the researchers calculations suggest that in some cases the mirror could completely offset the need for extra cooling In a rooftop comparison of the device in Stanford California scientists found that while a surface painted black reached 60C more than ambient temperature in sunlight and bare aluminium reached 40C more the mirror was up to 5C cooler than the surrounding air temperature If you cover signi cant parts of the roof with this mirror you can see how much power it can save You can signi cantly offset the electricity used for air conditioning said Shanhui Fan an expert in photonics at Stanford University who led the development of the mirror In some situations the computations say you can completely offset the air conditioning Buildings warm up in a number of different ways Hotwater boilers and cooking facilities release heat into their immediate surroundings In hot countries warm air comes in through doors and windows Then there is visible light and infrared radiation from the sun which also heat up buildings The Stanford mirror was designed in such a way that it re ects 97 of the visible light that falls on it But more importantly it works as a thermal radiator When the mirror is warmed up it releases heat at a speci c wavelength of infrared light that passes easily through the atmosphere and out into space To make anything cool requires what engineers call a heat sink somewhere to dump unwanted heat The heat sink has to be cooler than the object that needs cooling or it will not do its job For example a bucket of ice will cool a bottle of wine because it becomes a sink for heat in the liquid The Stanford mirror relies on the ultimate heat sink the universe itself The mirror is built from several layers of waferthin materials The rst layer is re ective silver On top of this are alternating layers of silicon dioxide and hafnium oxide These layers improve the re ectivity but also turn the mirror into a thermal radiator When silicon dioxide heats up it radiates the heat as infrared light at a wavelength of around ten micrometres Since there is very little in the atmosphere that absorbs at that wavelength the heat passes straight out to space The total thickness of the mirror is around two micrometres or two thousandths of a millimetre The cold darkness of the universe can be used as a renewable thermodynamic resource even during the hottest hours of the day the scientists write in Nature In tests the mirror had a cooling power of 40 watts per square metre at ambient temperature WritinginthejournalFanputstheinstalledcostof mirrors at between 20 and 70 per square metre and calculates an annual electricity saving of 100MWh on a threestorey building Fan said that the mirror could cool buildings or other objects simply by putting it in direct contact with them Coating the roof of a building with the mirror would prevent heating from sunlight but do little to remove heat from its interior More likely the mirror would be used to cool water or some other uid that would then be pumped around the building Fan said that the mirror could cool buildings or other objects simply by putting it in direct contact with them Coating the roof of a building with the mirror would prevent heating from sunlight but do little to remove heat from its interior More likely the mirror would be used to cool water or some other uid that would then be pumped around the building He ruled out the idea of using the mirrors to slow down global warming Roof space accounts for only a small portion of the Earths surface so at this point we dont think this would be a geoengineering solution Rather our contribution on the greenhousegasemission issue is simply to reduce electricity consumption he said Im really excited by the potential it has and the applications for cooling said Marin Soljai a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology You could use this on buildings so you have to spend much less on air conditioning or maybe you wouldnt need it at all You could put it on top of shopping malls With a large enough surface you could get substantial cooling,Scientists have designed a mirror that sends heat into cold space If you use the mirror you dont need to use airconditioning units that keep buildings cool on Earth The scientists believe that the mirror could reduce by a lot the amount of energy we use to control air temperatures in of ces and shopping centres Around 15 of the energy used by buildings in the US goes on air conditioning The researchers say that the mirror could mean that we no longer need air conditioning Scientists in Stanford California found that a roof painted black was 60C hotter than the air temperature in sunlight They found that aluminium was 40C hotter But the mirror was 5C cooler than the air temperature If you cover large parts of the roof with this mirror you can save a lot of power said Shanhui Fan an

from several layers of very thin materials These layers help the mirror to release heat The mirror sends the heat as infrared light out to space The mirror can use the cold darkness of the universe

electricity per year Fanalsosaidthatthemirrorcouldcoolbuildings but it would not slow down global warming But it would reduce the amount of electricity that businesses use Im really excited by this

119,Maria is sitting on a black plastic chair in a community centre on a cold Tuesday afternoon waiting for her number to be called She is number 34 When its her turn Maria is called forward to pick up a brown paper bag lled with essentials including pasta eggs and corn akes and is invited to choose between butternut squash or carrots as this weeks vegetables Maria is the 34th client so far today at East Hampton Food Pantry a community initiative set up just streets away from some of the most expensive and exclusive properties in the world By the end of the day the food pantrys organizers expect more than 400 families to have followed Maria through the doors to collect their weekly food parcel to help them get through the cold dark Long Island winter In the summertime the Hamptons a collection of historic oceanfront towns and villages 100 miles from Manhattan is a billionaires playground But come Labor Day in early September when the rich and famous shut up their mansions and head back to Manhattan or Beverly Hills the glitz gives way to the gritty reality of life for the mostly immigrant community who live here all year The people who come here are rich and famous but we who live here are not says Maria who works 14hour days in the summer cleaning mansions but goes months without any work at all in the winter Maria laughs when asked if she has enough money There is no work in the winter only in the summertime says Maria who like many of the workers in the Hamptons is from Latin America Here lots of people live in a single room because they cant pay the rent She says some families with up to ve children are crammed into basements and still pay more than 1000 a month in rent People come here looking for work but in the winter there is nothing Lots of her friends cant pay for heating or medication and many would go hungry if it were not for the East Hampton Food Pantry she says which is just one of several food pantries in the town Vicki Littman chairperson of the East Hampton Food Pantry which provided more than 31000 food parcels in 2015 says the number of people seeking out the food pantry is ever increasing Once Labor Day comes and the season is over and peoples hours start to be cut back our numbers go up to about 400 families a week she says When they come to us on Tuesday they get two to three days worth of food Without us they would struggle that much more Littman says it can be hard for outsiders to realize that there are people struggling to get by in a place known the world over for its excess When I discuss with the summer community that comes out here about the food pantries theyre always shocked because there is that glamorous side of the Hamptons where there are galas and the beaches and the mansions that are here But what people dont realize is that there is that service industry Its the landscapers the nannies the waitresses they are all relying on that summer income to get them through the winter but people dont see that when theyre coming out on holiday There are seniors who have to sometimes pick between whether they are going to pay for their medications or pay their bills or buy food and that shouldnt be the case Littman says the town has lost too many people working key jobs such as teachers police of cers and even doctors and dentists because they cant afford to live in the community and the food pantry board is determined to do more to ensure people have a better shot at staying put Housing is by far the biggest cost in the Hamptons At 147m the nations most expensive property is hedge fund manager Barry Rosensteins 18acre beachfront estate at 67 Further Lane a stones throw from Maidstone Golf Club which is considered the most elite prestigious and dif cult to get into of all the Hamptons clubs Larry Cantwell East Hamptons town supervisor and lifelong resident says homes regularly change hands at more than 25m and the rapid price in ation at the top end has trickled down to even the towns most modest ats Finding your rst home is a challenge in an area like this Cantwell says Not just people who you would characterize as poor working and middleclass families are also having a hard time If you can nd a home to buy anywhere in East Hampton for 500000 youre very lucky Cantwell says more than half the towns homes are empty for most of the year which causes the population to dwindle to as little as 10000 in the winter months compared with 80000 in August Its kind of the tale of two cities Theres certainly a lot of wealth here but almost all of that wealth is in second homes only used in the summer says Cantwell the son of a sherman father and a housecleaner mother But the rest of us live here year round There are famous and very wealthy people but then you have hardworking and poor people struggling to get by Youve got to remember that this community was founded as a farming and shing community of people who lived off the land and the water a real workingclass community Cantwell says saving up enough money to buy your rst house while working as a farmer or sherman is nearimpossible in East Hampton today and its not just the poor police of cers teachers young professionals and others all struggle to nd a place to live here and many of them cannot afford to own their own home Being homeless in the Hamptons means spending a lot of time on a bus Various houses of worship have joined together to ensure there is somewhere for the homeless to spend the night over the winter Churches up and down the north and south fork of Long Island take on the burden one night at a time and roughly 50 homeless people are bussed between them every day Eddie Vallone 22 is one of those on the bus every night People look at the Hamptons as some sort of rich town and theres no problems going on But there are a lot of problems here especially drugs Its hard to really grasp OK the summer is coming to an end What am I going to do for the winter Vallone says at Maureens Haven a charity that coordinates the homeless shelter programme I want to work but theres no work to be done Vallone who works cleaning pools and doing odd jobs on luxury estates says that

94,Unveiling a car with a top speed of 25mph two seats and no pedals or steering wheel might not make much of an impression at a motor show But Google in the US sent a minor earthquake through the car and taxi industries as it unveiled the latest version of its driverless car The electrically powered vehicle which Google has begun testing around its headquarters in Mountain View California dispenses with all the normal controls including foot pedals Instead it has a smartphone app that summons it and tells it the destination and a single STOP button mounted between the two frontfacing seats in case the occupants need to override the computer The car in fact takes over all the tasks of navigation steering acceleration and braking The company is building about 100 prototypes for a twoyear test The companys cofounder Sergey Brin told a conference in California that the vehicle was still in the prototype stage but that the project was about changing the world for people who are not well served by transportation today He said of the car Youre just sitting there no steering wheel no pedals For me it was very relaxing About ten seconds after getting in I forgot I was there It reminded me of catching a chairlift by yourself a bit of solitude I found really enjoyable Google says that the principal aim of the project is to improve safety and that because the car is constructed with impactabsorbing foam at the front and a plastic windscreen it should be far safer than any other car for pedestrians The cars which have been built specially by a company as yet unnamed in Detroit will be used to investigate further how best to make driverless vehicles work Google will run a pilot programme using the cars which are not yet for sale One challenge is creating highdefinition scans of the roads and surroundings before the cars can drive along them because they cannot gather and process enough information in real time So far there are highdetail maps of about 2000 miles of Californias roads but the state has more than 170000 miles of public roads Google says it is interested in licensing the technology to traditional vehicle manufacturers once it has refined it sufficiently Members of the team had been working on the project even before joining Google for more than a decade But the prospect of driverless cars replacing humandriven taxis has been the cause of some alarm If you get rid of the driver then theyre unemployed said Dennis Conyon the southeast director for the UK National Taxi Association It would have a major impact on the labour force London has about 22000 licensed black cabs and Conyon estimates that the total number of people who drive taxis for hire in the UK is about 100000 However Steve McNamara general secretary of the 10500strong London Taxi Drivers Association said You wont get these driverless cars in London for 20 or 25 years Maybe by then theyll have a charge point because there isnt a single one in London now Other car makers including Volvo Ford and Mercedes are working on driverassisted vehicles which unlike Googles version do not dispense with the driver controls But Chris Urmson director of the selfdriving car project at Google said that the new prototypes dispensed with the steering wheel and brakes because there was no guarantee that a human occupant would be able to take over in an emergency and that it was simpler just to have an emergency stop button Urmson said The vehicles will be very basic We want to learn from them and adapt them as quickly as possible But they will take you where you want to go at the push of a button And thats an important step towards improving road safety and transforming mobility for millions of people So far the Google versions of the selfdriving cars have covered 700000 miles without an accident caused by the computer The company points out that thousands of people die each year on the roads and that about 80 of crashes can be ascribed to human error But they could have some way to go to match Conyon at the National Taxi Association Aged 79 he has been driving a taxi for 50 years and claims never to have had an accident,A

of roads Google says it wants to license the technology to traditional car makers when they have improved it But the idea that driverless cars will replace taxis with human drivers has alarmed some people Dennis Conyon from the UK National Taxi Association said that taxi drivers will become unemployed London has about 22000 black taxis and Conyon thinks that the total number of people who drive taxis in the UK is about 100000 Other car makers including Volvo Ford and Mercedes are going to make vehicles that will be different from Googles version because they will have driver controls But

46,The age of the big British summer music festival including Glastonbury is drawing to a close according to the leading rock promoter and manager Harvey Goldsmith The man who has produced and worked with most of the western worlds biggest music stars from the Who the Rolling Stones and Queen to Madonna Bob Dylan and Luciano Pavarotti said the biggest problem was a dire lack of major new bands to succeed the old ones The festival circuit has peaked he said speaking at the Hay Festival of Literature and Arts in Powys Wales It really peaked about two years ago Theres too many of them and there are not enough big acts to headline them That is a big big problem in our industry And we are not producing a new generation of these kind of acts the likes of the Rolling Stones Muse even the Arctic Monkeys that can headline There were about 900 music festival events in the UK between May and September 2014 he said and there is no way they can all continue Music festivals have probably run their course What is going to happen is a growth in events where it isnt just music but like this one with poetry or books or magic shows There will be lots of small combination festivals that give something extra not people standing around in a massive great eld unable to go to the toilet because they might miss the band Clearly the way music is being delivered has changed he said People dont seem to want to listen to a body of work an album any more And most rock bands built a reputation on a body of work they might take three albums to really hone their art to become great but young people dont want that They home in on a track a sound then ping off again to the next one Pop pervades not that theres anything wrong with pop I think it will come round again but it will take time Goldsmith 69 also revealed that he has teamed up with Robin de Levita the Dutch producer of the Whos 1970s rock musical Tommy at a new 1100seat theatre in Wembley which is due to be nished in time for the rst stage adaptation of the phenomenally successful teen book and movie series The Hunger Games in June 2016 De Levita would said Goldsmith be bringing his experimental SceneAround concept to London theatre that puts the audience seating on a turntable that rotates round a series of scenes built around its circumference accompanied by projections on panel screens The concept was pioneered in an aircraft hangar outside Amsterdam and has proved hugely successful Goldsmith who is already planning to bring a production of the Anne Frank story to the asyetunnamed venue said Its a whole completely different way of producing shows During his Hay appearance the impresario also revealed some of the accessallareas secrets from his long career in the music industry talking about Keith Moon putting dynamite down a Sydney hotel room toilet in an effort to unblock it and witnessing the paralysing stage fright that gripped John Lennon just before an appearance at Madison Square Garden in 1974 and led to him being dragged vomiting out of his dressing room and shoved out on stage Its the most bizarre thing really how common that is among artists Its odd how stricken with fear theyll get but as soon as the rst chord is hit theyre ne he said He also laid to rest a longrunning rock n roll mystery why Elvis Presley never performed outside North America Presleys longtime manager Colonel Tom Parker admitted to him over tea he said that the real reason why Goldsmiths attempts to bring the singer to London had failed was Parkers own uncertain immigration status He explained that it was because he was an illegal Dutch immigrant He didnt want to risk leaving the US it was him not Elvis said Goldsmith And his ultimate rock n roll performer Freddie Mercury had to be our most powerful stage performer the best live performer weve ever had At Live Aid he went out and saw that audience and just grabbed it But the next Queen was still far from being formed he said Were not producing a new generation of this kind of act Coldplay is probably the last one to come up and that was ten years ago There isnt much out there that looks like it is forming the next generation of heritage artists So with no big acts to headline there are no big shows Glastonbury has got to the point where it cant nd any more big acts and thats the pinnacle of the festivals They are really over,The age of the big British summer music festival including Glastonbury is ending according to the top rock manager Harvey Goldsmith He has produced and worked with most of the western worlds

Sydney hotel room toilet to unblock it And he said that John Lennon had stage fright at Madison Square Garden in 1974 he vomited and they had to push him onto the stage Its bizarre how common stage fright is among artists Its odd how afraid they get but as soon as the music starts theyre ne he said He also gave the answer to a rock n roll mystery why Elvis Presley never performed outside North

142,Throughout a momentous day at Liverpools Anglican Cathedral for the families of the 96 people who died so needlessly at Sheffield Wednesdays Hillsborough football ground one phrase dominated above all else the truth These were the words most infamously abused by a headline in The Sun newspaper above stories which we now know in extraordinarily shocking detail were fed by the South Yorkshire Police to deflect their own culpability for the disaster on to the innocent victims Margaret Aspinall whose son James then 18 died at what should have been a joyful day out an FA Cup semifinal between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest said the families had been forced to fight for 23 years for just that the truth Aspinall Chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group said that although the families loss would never fade she was delighted at the unequivocal profound apology given for Hillsboroughs savage failings by David Cameron The Hillsborough Independent Panel had inspected 450000 documents generated by the police Sheffield Wednesday and all other bodies responsible and delivered its remarkable 395page report indicting official failings and vindicating the victims and football supporters Some of what happened to cause the disaster and the polices subsequent blameshifting has been exposed before But the depth of what the families call a coverup in particular the deliberate police campaign to avoid its own responsibilities and falsely blame the supporters was still startling In a concerted campaign led the panel found by the Chief Constable Peter Wright the South Yorkshire Police put out their story that drunken supporters or those without tickets had caused the disaster The victims had their blood tested for alcohol levels This was an exceptional decision the panel said for which it found no rationale When victims had alcohol in their blood the police then checked to find if they had criminal records The report substantially authored by Professor Phil Scraton of Queens University Belfast and unanimously agreed by the panel of eight experts found there was no evidence to verify the serious allegations of exceptional levels of drunkenness ticketlessness or violence among Liverpool fans The report found that even as the nightmare began for the families of the victims Wright was meeting his police federation in a Sheffield restaurant to prepare a defence and a rocksolid story The Secretary of the South Yorkshire Police Federation branch Constable Paul Middup told the restaurant meeting before Wright turned up The Chief Constable had said the truth could not come from him but had given the secretary a totally free hand and supported him as had many senior officers The meeting was held just four days after the disaster It was the day that The Sun splashed its headline The Truth over lies fed to it by four senior South Yorkshire police officers Middup was encouraged to continue this police campaign of defaming Liverpool supporters for supposed drunkenness and misbehaviour and to get the message togetherness across to the force The panels report sustained the allegation made in parliament that the orchestrated changing of junior officers statements by senior South Yorkshire police officers amounted to a black propaganda unit The officers statements presented as official police accounts to the subsequent inquiry were changed to delete criticism of the police themselves on the day and largely emphasize misbehaviour by supporters The panel found that 116 of 164 statements were amended to remove or alter comments unfavourable to South Yorkshire police The police had claimed this was done only to remove conjecture and opinion from the statements but the panel had no doubt the operation to craft a case rather than deliver truthful police accounts went further It was done to remove criticism of the police Scraton said This propaganda did not convince the original inquiry which ruled as quickly as August 1989 that the police stories of fan drunkenness and misbehaviour were false and criticized the police for making the claims The report revealed that Sheffield Wednesdays football ground was unsafe in crucial respects that the Football Association had selected it as the venue for the match without even checking if Hillsborough had a valid safety certificate which it did not In that landscape of neglect it was the mismanagement of the crowd by the police commanded by an inexperienced Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield that was the prime cause of the disaster The police lost control outside the ground where 24000 Liverpool fans had to be funnelled through just 23 turnstiles so Duckenfield ordered a large exit gate to be opened and a large number of people to be allowed in His blunder of the first magnitude according to the inquiry was the failure to close off the tunnel that led to the already overcrowded central section of the Leppings Lane terrace The inquiry report established this but the police undaunted repeated their claims to the subsequent inquest Its procedure was marked by the coroners decision not to take evidence of what happened after 315pm on the day of the disaster thereby excluding an emergency response the panel found to have been chaotic The finding that 41 of the 96 who died could possibly have been saved had the police and ambulance service done their jobs decently is damning of those bodies and Aspinall said difficult for the families to contemplate In the light of the panels report the Attorney General will now consider whether to apply to the High Court for the inquest verdict of accidental death to be quashed and a new inquest held There may be prosecutions too after all these years of Sheffield Wednesday South Yorkshire Police and Sheffield City Council which failed in its duty to oversee the safety of the football ground Trevor Hicks the President of the HFSG both of whose teenage daughters Sarah and Victoria died in the crush said The truth is out today Tomorrow is for justice,Ninetysix people died at Sheffield Wednesdays Hillsborough Stadium in 1989 During an extraordinary day 23 years later at Liverpool Cathedral where the families of the victims met to see a report on the disaster the most important words were the truth This was the headline in The Sun newspaper We now know that the story in the newspaper was false and that the police gave them the story Margaret Aspinalls son James then 18 died at the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest She said the families had to fight for 23 years for the truth She said that the families sadness will never go away but she is very pleased that the Prime Minister said sorry for Hillsborough An independent panel looked at 450000 documents written by the police Sheffield Wednesday and all the other groups involved The panel then wrote a 395page report In the report they criticize official mistakes and say that the victims and other fans were not to blame We already knew the cause of the disaster but we didnt know that the police coverup was so big It is shocking how the police blamed the football fans for the disaster The panel found that the South Yorkshire Police led by the Chief Constable Peter Wright told their story that drunken fans or those without tickets caused the disaster They tested the victims blood for alcohol When victims had alcohol in their blood the police then checked to find if they had criminal records The police said that many Liverpool fans were very drunk were without tickets and were very violent but the report found no evidence for this The report said that Wright met with police in a Sheffield restaurant to prepare a defence and a story The meeting happened just four days after the disaster It was the day that The Sun newspaper published its headline The Truth and the story by four senior South Yorkshire police officers The panel found that officers statements were changed to remove criticism of the police and emphasize bad behaviour by fans The panel found that 116 of 164 statements were changed to remove or change negative comments about South Yorkshire police The police said this was done only to remove opinion from the statements but the panel said they did more than that It was done to remove criticism of the police the report said The original inquiry did not believe this propaganda It decided in August 1989 that the police stories of fan drunkenness and violence were false and it criticized the police for telling lies It said that Sheffield Wednesdays stadium was unsafe that the Football Association chose that stadium for the match without even checking if it had a safety certificate It did not have a certificate But the main cause of the disaster was the way the police controlled the crowd The police lost control outside the stadium where 24000 Liverpool fans had to go through just 23 small entrance gates So police opened a large exit gate and lots of people were allowed in They did not close one of the tunnels and the inquiry said this was their big mistake But the police still repeated their lies at the inquest The coroner decided not to take evidence of what happened after 315pm on the day of the disaster so he did not look at the chaotic behaviour of the police and the ambulance service The panel found that if the police and ambulance service had done their jobs better they could have saved 41 of the 96 lives lost There may now be a new inquest There may be prosecutions too after all these years of Sheffield Wednesday South Yorkshire Police and Sheffield City Council which was responsible for the safety of the stadium Trevor Hicks whose two daughters died in the disaster said The truth is out today Hicks said Tomorrow is for justice,validation,ADV,ELE
116,You can no longer legally smoke a cigarette inside a bar in the worlds drinking capital New Orleans Louisiana City after city has banned indoor smoking but thats different because other cities dont attract tourist dollars by aggressively advertising a let the good times roll attitude as New Orleans does An indoor smoking ban here will have consequences as unique as New Orleanss cultural ecosystem itself As the Wall Street Journal recently reported New Orleans city government has since Hurricane Katrina in 2005 begun trying to turn down the volume a bit With the support of neighbourhood groups the city has begun policing bars and nightclubs more strictly while at the same time ghting to implement a new noise ordinance read music ordinance This is just the wrong time for them to have pursued something like this complains bar owner William Walker who for reasons of personal choice hates the antismoking law Forcing people outside the bar to smoke is going to exacerbate the tension thats already there Many of New Orleanss best bars and some of its live music spots are in relatively quiet residential neighbourhoods This neighbourly coexistence is a big part of what makes New Orleans different and charming Recently though this unique social contract has become unacceptable for some people and the fate of New Orleanss musical personality feels at stake Martha Wood lives beside a loud bar that hosts live music The bar was one of the deciding factors in me buying the house so I wont ever complain about the noise says Wood who also manages a livemusic bar which following a series of noise issues in 2013 including complaints about the loud smokers outside became one of New Orleanss rst ever bars legally disallowed from serving drinks to go Now any small infraction could get us shut down says Wood We recently installed a smoke eater to help with the smoke because we cant open the doors at night because of the noise The Maple Leaf club went smokefree voluntarily in 2014 as did another club where artists had been demanding smokefree nights A lot of the performance venues were already starting to show that consideration to performers so I wish the city would have just let that happen instead of forcing the ban into every corner bar that doesnt host music says Zalia BeVille manager of the All Ways Lounge which went smokefree in 2013 because she says The horn players and the singers they asked us for it Luckily All Ways has an outdoor patio unlike Lost Love Lounge whose owner Geoff Douville loves the ban hed previously felt forced to live with smoke to keep his bar nancially viable Theres no way I could have banned smoking in my bar without it being a rule throughout the whole city says Douville People act like I have that choice as a business owner But if I make that rule they walk down the block to a bar with smoking So I need it to be uniformed across the board for everybody Many small business owners also fear smoke free revenue loss Smoker Neil Timms owns an English pub and met the smoking ban before in England Back home in Coventry every pub where I was a regular closed within a year of the smoking ban remembers Timms of the UKs ban begun in 2007 To avoid the same fate hes spending money to build a patio Lost Loves Douville though feels the ban to be a great business opportunity The number of people who would enjoy coming out to our bar with our food but would never come because they didnt want to smell like smoke for the next seven days were now an option for all those people Nor does Douville worry about noise complaints like Walker does No court is gonna label a bar a nuisance after the city has rati ed a smoking ban that requires you to go outside he says I want to see a judge reconcile no loitering with no smoking inside Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell who introduced and pushed the ban disagrees The responsibility is on the barowner to keep their clientele respectful outside their establishment as well she says The owners and bartenders need to tell them to go have a smoke but be respectful to their communities The idea that we cant have clean air because it will cause noise problems is ridiculous It can be a winwin I think its about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses Cantrell does acknowledge the citys uniqueness in terms of a smoking ban How is New Orleans different from the rest of the country New Orleans is known as the City that Care Forgot she says New Orleans needs to stand up and say We care about our people The most vulnerable people who are working in smoky conditions these citizens are the backbone of our hospitality industry which drives the economy in the state of Louisiana She adds New Orleans is also unlike other places because you do have the option of taking your drink outside with you when you go out to smoke Many worried that the already strained New Orleans Police Department didnt need any part in policing smokers So the health department will handle bar warnings and nes Bar customers are encouraged to come ll out a form or call 311 and to include dateandtimestamped photographs documenting illegal smoking For this reason alone Neil Timms says hell comply with the ban I dont want someone to be sitting in the corner smoking and someone takes a photo of em and gets beaten up Unworried Geoff Douville says that hes used to noise complaints by now so bring on the ban Watch the nosy neighbours who complain about the noise now are gonna be the same ones who wanted the smoking ban to begin with In the end Douville shares Cantrells winwin optimism Of course theyre gonna complain he accepts But it doesnt mean theyre gonna win,It is no longer legal to smoke a cigarette inside a bar in the worlds drinking capital New Orleans Louisiana Since Hurricane Katrina in 2005 New Orleans city government has begun trying to reduce noise problems The city is now stricter on noise in bars and nightclubs and at the same time it has introduced new rules on noise It is the wrong time for this complains barowner William Walker He hates the antismoking law If they force people outside the bar to smoke it is going to increase the tension thats already there Many of New Orleanss best bars are in quiet neighbourhoods Martha Wood lives beside a loud bar that has live music The bar was one

every bar that doesnt have music says Zalia BeVille manager of the All Ways Lounge Luckily All Ways has an outdoor patio Another bar Lost Love Lounge doesnt have a patio The owner Geoff Douville loves the ban before he felt forced to live with smoke to keep his bar popular I couldnt ban smoking in my bar without a ban in the whole city says Douville People think I have that choice But if I make a nosmoking rule they will choose another bar with smoking Many small business owners also fear that the smokefree rule will make them lose money Neil Timms owns an English pub and saw a smoking ban before in England Back home in England every pub I knew closed because of the smoking ban remembers Timms of Englands ban which began in 2007 To avoid the same problems hes spending money to build a patio But Douville feels the ban could be a great business opportunity There are lots of people who would enjoy coming to our bar but they never came because they didnt want to smell like smoke for

So the health department will do it Bar customers must ll out a form or call 311 and include photographs of illegal smoking Geoff Douville says that hes used to noise complaints You will see the

US president Obama told 500 youth leaders at a town hall meeting in London Im here to ask you to reject the notion there are forces we cant control As JFK said our problems are manmade and can be solved by man Youve never had better tools to make a difference he told the Alevel and UKUS exchange students at the QA session Reject pessimism cynicism and know that progress is possible Progress is not inevitable it requires struggle discipline and faith But Obama acknowledged the challenges faced by young people Not to say your generation has had it easy in a time of breathtaking change from

healthcare and education He urged the audience to interact with people with different political beliefs Seek out people who dont agree with you and it will also help you to compromise Obama also said You should feel encouraged social attitudes are changing That doesnt mean its fast enough but you should keep pushing and its in part due to the courageous acts of young people like yourself When asked about his presidential legacy Obama said he was proud of the healthcare reforms which received huge cheers from the audience and said of the US response to the 2008 financial crisis Saving the world from great depression that was quite good He also listed diplomatic deals with Iran and the response to the Ebola crisis as highlights of his presidency Im proud I think Ive been true to myself

Imafidon the managing director of the youth organization ClearView Research said afterwards It was a great opportunity and what will stick with me is what he said about meeting with people who have different politics from you and having to make compromises Also the thing he said about being a good leader and finding great talent Later Obama met Jeremy Corbyn who said they had an excellent 90minute discussion The Labour leader said they talked about the challenges facing postindustrial societies and the power of global corporations and the increasing use of technology around the world

155,Police and intelligence agencies around the world have for almost 100 years relied on lie detectors to help convict criminals or unearth spies and traitors The polygraph is beloved of the movies with countless dramatic moments showing the guilty sweating profusely as they are hooked up But the invention could soon be defunct Researchers in Britain and the Netherlands have made a breakthrough developing a method with a success rate in tests of over 70 that could be in use in police stations around the world within a decade Rather than relying on facial tics talking too much or waving of arms all seen as telltale signs of lying the new method involves monitoring fullbody motions to provide an indicator of signs of guilty feelings The polygraph is widely used in the US in criminal and other cases and for security clearance for the FBI and CIA but is much less popular in Europe There has been a lot of scepticism in the scientific and legal communities about its reliability By contrast the new method developed by the researchers has performed well in experiments The basic premise is that liars fidget more and so the use of an allbody motion suit the kind used in films to create computergenerated characters will pick this up The suit contains 17 sensors that register movement up to 120 times per second in three dimensions for 23 joints One of the research team Ross Anderson professor of security engineering at Cambridge University said Decades of deception research show that the interviewer will tell truth from lies only slightly better than random about 55 out of 100 The polygraph has been around since the 1920s and by measuring physiological stress induced by anxiety you can get to 60 However it can easily be abused as an interrogation prop and many people are anxious anyway facing a polygraph on which their job or liberty depends He said the new method by contrast achieved a reliability rating of over 70 and he was confident they would be able to do better In some tests the team has already achieved more than 80 Anderson said The takeaway message is that guilty people fidget more and we can measure this robustly Anderson added that the research had a special significance at this time against the background of the US Senate report on torture by the CIA Apart from the moral case against torture Anderson pointed out that it was a very unreliable way of gathering accurate information We have known for a long time that torture does not work he said The new method offers a pragmatic scientifically backed alternative to conducting interviews The research paper was written by Dr Sophie van der Zee of Cambridge University Professor Ronald Poppe of Utrecht University Professor Paul Taylor of Lancaster University and Anderson The polygraph was created in 1921 by policeman John Larson based on research by the psychologist William Marston It records changes in pulse blood pressure sweating and breathing to ascertain whether a subject is lying While cinema depictions suggest the device is nearinfallible the US Supreme Court ruled in 1998 that there was no consensus that the polygraph was reliable a finding supported by the US National Academy of Scientists in 2003 The experiment carried out by Anderson and his colleagues involved 180 students and employees at Lancaster University of which half were told to tell the truth and half to lie They were each paid 750 for their participation in the 70minute experiment involving two tests Some were interviewed about a computer game Never End which they played for seven minutes while others lied about playing it having only been shown notes about it The second test involved a lost wallet containing 5 Some were asked to bring the wallet to a lostandfound box while others hid it and lied about it Overall we correctly classified 822 truths 889 lies 756 of the interviewees as either being truthful or deceptive based on the combined movement in their individual limbs the report says Anderson said Our first attempt looked at the extent to which different body parts and body signals indicated deception It turned out that liars wave their arms more but again this is only at the 60 level that you can get from a conventional polygraph The pay dirt was when we considered total body motion That turns out to tell truth from lies over 70 of the time and we believe it can be improved still further by combining it with optimal questioning techniques Another advantage is that total body motion is relatively unaffected by cultural background anxiety and cognitive load how much you are thinking which confound other liedetection technologies Anderson said The use of allbody suits is expensive they cost about 30000 and can be uncomfortable and Anderson and his colleagues are now looking at lowcost alternatives These include using motionsensing technology from computer games such as the Kinect devices developed by Microsoft for the Xbox console Anderson acknowledges that agencies such as the CIA could teach agents how to counter the fullbody motion method by freezing their bodies but he said that in itself would be a giveaway,Police and intelligence agencies around the world have for almost 100 years used the polygraph a liedetector test to help catch criminals and spies But now researchers in Britain and the Netherlands have developed a new method which is correct in tests over 70 of the time Police stations around the world might begin using this new method within ten years It doesnt monitor movements in the face talking too much or waving arms all signs that someone is lying The new method monitors movements in the whole body which can show that the person is feeling guilty The polygraph is often used in the US in criminal cases and by the FBI and CIA but is much less popular in Europe Many people do not believe that it is reliable The basic idea behind the new method is that liars fidget more and that an allbody motion suit the kind used in films to create computergenerated characters will record this The new method is over 70 reliable the polygraph is only 55 reliable In some tests the success rate of the new method was more than 80 Ross Anderson one of the research team said Guilty people fidget more and we can now measure this The polygraph was created in 1921 by policeman John Larson It records changes in pulse blood pressure sweating and breathing to find out if someone is lying In movies the polygraph is always correct but in 1998 the US Supreme Court decided that there was no agreement that the polygraph was reliable The US National Academy of Scientists said the same thing in 2003 The tests Anderson and his colleagues did involved 180 students and employees at Lancaster University Half of the people were told to tell the truth and half to lie The researchers interviewed some of the people about a computer game called Never End that they played for seven minutes Others lied about playing it The second test involved a lost wallet with 5 inside Some people had to bring the wallet to a lostandfound box Others hid it and lied about it The new bodysuit method was correct 822 of the time Researchers monitored how much the people moved their arms and legs to decide if they were telling the truth or lying Allbody suits are expensive they cost about 30000 and they can be uncomfortable so Anderson and his colleagues are now looking at cheaper alternatives These include using motionsensing technology from computer games such as the Kinect devices developed by

65,Benjamin Carle is 969 made in France right down to his underpants and socks Unfortunately six Ikea forks a Chinese guitar and unsourced wall paint stopped him being declared a 100 economic patriot but nobody is perfect Carle 26 set out in 2013 to see if it was possible to live using only Frenchmade products for ten months as part of a television documentary The idea was triggered by the Minister for Economic Renewal Arnaud Montebourgs call for the public to buy French to save the countrys industrial production sector The experiment cost Carle his smartphone television refrigerator all made in China his spectacles Italian his underpants Moroccan morning coffee Guatemalan and his adored David Bowie music British Fortunately his longsuffering girlfriend Anas and cat Loon both French stuck with him Politicians say all sorts of things and expect us to go along with it I wanted to see if it was possible and feasible to do what the minister was asking us to do to hold him to account for his words Carle told the Guardian over a nonFrench coffee in a Parisian caf after finishing his documentary He set just three rules eat only foods produced in France eliminate contact with foreignmade goods and do so on 1800 a month above the minimum wage of 1430 to cover the extra expense of living in Paris The journalist was shocked to find out at the start of the experiment that only 45 of the contents of his flat were made nationally and that the rest would have to go including the lightbulbs China and green beans Kenya The removal men left his home almost bare Left without a refrigerator none are made in France or nail clippers he was forced to chill his food on the window ledge and saw at his toenails with a penknife His foreignmade clothes down to his underwear were replaced with more expensive alternatives Frenchproduced underpants 26 socks 9 polo shirt 75 espadrille sandals 26 but no jeans as none are produced in France During the experiment Carle scoured supermarket shelves for 100 Frenchmade products learned to cook seasonal fruit and vegetables grown in France proudly brushed his teeth with the last toothbrush made in France by a company in Picardie employing 29 people and handwashed his smalls until he found the last Frenchmade washing machine which being top opening would not fit under the kitchen counter Going out with friends was problematic no American films no Belgian beer no sushi or pizza Staying home with no sofa for the first few months and no television meant listening to crooner Michel Sardou and reading French novels French wine was of course allowed and FrenchCanadian singer Cline Dion but not according to his advisers French bands such as Daft Punk who sing in English Unable to use his Britishmade bicycle or even a French car after discovering the only affordable Peugeot Renault and Citron models are mostly made overseas he invested in a fugemitting orange Mobylette moped The last things to go were the computer replaced by a Qooq a recipe tablet that connects slowly to the internet and the iPhone swapped for an old Sagem mobile The documentary shows Carle realizing he is addicted to his iPhone smashing it with a brandnew Frenchmade Tefal saucepan while his girlfriend shrieks Are you crazy Those are new pans Carle tells viewers his aim is to save the French economy After all I like Mission Impossible He admits the experiment was part serious and part jest At one point he consults a French language expert to check if he should be using cool and other Anglicisms he was advised to swap it for the nearest French equivalent chouette On discovering France makes no refrigerators apart from wine coolers or televisions but is big in aeroplane seats and windmills he sighs and says Great Nothing that will fit into my apartment At the end of the experiment Carle takes out a bank loan to refurnish his home and clothe himself A special auditor declares him 969 made in France and Montebourg visits to present him with a medal Carles conclusion Its not entirely possible or even desirable to live 100 made in France particularly in terms of new technology But that wasnt the point This wasnt about French nationalism or patriotism It was trying to show that we should reflect about the way we consume and make different choices and that applies in all countries If we want to save jobs and industries wherever we are we might think about supporting them A Tshirt is more expensive in France but I can be sure it has been produced by workers who are correctly paid and have good working conditions I cannot be sure about a cheaper Tshirt produced in Asia or Morocco He added Its hypocrisy to go around blaming capitalists for a countrys economic decline when people could be doing more as consumers Carle says he hopes to continue supporting French industry and producers but not 100 It is a fulltime job just finding the stuff he said The first thing he did when the experiment ended was invite his friends around for the evening to enjoy a plate of cheese and listen to the David Bowie album Aladdin Sane It was difficult not being able to invite people around because there was nowhere to sit but Id choose the Bowie over a sofa any day,Benjamin Carle is 969 made in France even his underpants and socks Six Ikea forks a Chinese guitar and some wall paint stopped him being called 100 French but nobody is perfect Carle 26 decided in 2013 to see if it was possible to live using only Frenchmade products for ten months as part of a television documentary He got the idea after the Minister for Economic Renewal Arnaud Montebourg asked the French people to buy French products For the experiment Carle had to give up his smartphone television refrigerator all made in China his glasses Italian his morning coffee Guatemalan and his favourite David Bowie music British It is lucky that his girlfriend Anas and cat Loon are both French so he didnt have to give them up I wanted to see if it was possible to do what the minister was asking us to do Carle said He had just three rules eat only food made in France not have any contact with foreignmade products and to do it

6,The tranquil chorus of the natural world is in danger of being lost to todays generation as people screen out the noises that surround them a senior US researcher warns Rising levels of background noise in some areas threaten to make people oblivious to the uplifting sounds of birdsong trickling water and trees rustling in the wind which can often be heard even in urban centres said Kurt Fristrup a senior scientist at the US National Park Service The problem was exacerbated by people listening to music through their earphones instead of tuning in to the birds and other sounds of nature that can easily be drowned out by traf c music and other noises he said This learned deafness is a real issue Fristrup told the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in San Jose We are conditioning ourselves to ignore the information coming into our ears This gift that we are born with to reach out and hear things hundreds of metres away all these incredible sounds is in danger of being lost through a generational amnesia he said There is a real danger both of loss of auditory acuity where we are exposed to noise for so long that we stop listening but also a loss of listening habits where we lose the ability to engage with the environment the way we were built to he added For the past ten years the US National Park Service has recorded sound levels at more than 600 sites across the US including Yosemite in California Yellowstone and Denali in Alaska Not one was unaffected by some form of noise from human activity be it over ying aircraft motorbikes motorboats or tour buses Fristrups team combined the sound levels recorded from national parks with similar data from urban settings to create a model of noise levels across the US They predict that noise pollution is growing faster than the US population and more than doubles every 30 years Its not surprising people are putting on earphones or even noise cancelling headphones to try and create a quieter or more congenial environment he said As you raise background sound levels it has the same effect on your hearing that fog would have on your vision Instead of having this expansive experience of all the sounds around you you are aware of only a small area around you he said Even in most of our cities there are birds and things to appreciate in the environment and there can be very rich natural choruses to pay attention to And that is being lost People quickly become accustomed to changes in their environments including rising noise levels and over time Fristrup fears that we will accept far worse environmental conditions than we should and forget how much quieter the world could be If nding peace and quiet becomes dif cult enough many many children will grow up without the experience and I think its a very real problem he said The warning came as other scientists reported bene cial health effects from listening to natural sounds Speaking at the same meeting Derrick Taff a social scientist at Pennsylvania State University described preliminary experiments which suggest that listening to recordings from national parks of waterfalls birdsong and wind helped people recover from stressful events In one experiment Taff told participants who visited his lab to give an impromptu talk that would be judged by researchers standing behind a oneway mirror Measurements of their heart rate and the stress hormone cortisol before and after the speech found that people calmed down faster when they listened to nature recordings than when the same audio tracks were interspersed with sounds from road traf c aeroplanes and even normal conversation We know that natural sounds are very important to people They are some of the main reasons people visit protected areas They want to hear the natural quiet the birdsong and the wind and water Taff said We may be losing this as people are listening to iPods all the time but I do believe that the public is appreciative of these sounds My advice is to go to your protected areas and experience what you are missing Why natural sounds might be calming to people is unclear but Fristrup speculates that over millions of years of evolution we may have come to associate the more tranquil sounds of the natural world with safety I suspect theres something about these intact soundscapes that reminds our ancestral brains of a place thats safe where theres no sense of a predator nearby and that these more cluttered soundscapes are problematic for us because we know weve lost that surveillance capability he said,People today might not hear the sounds of the natural world because they screen out the noises around them says a US researcher More background noise can make people oblivious to the uplifting sounds of birdsong water and trees in the wind You can often hear these sounds even in cities said Kurt Fristrup a senior scientist at the US National Park Service The problem is even worse because people listen to music through their earphones instead of listening to the birds and other sounds of nature Natural sounds are easily drowned out by traf c music and others noises Fristrup said This learned deafness is a real problem Fristrup told the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in San Jose We are training ourselves to ignore the information that comes into our ears This gift that we are born with the ability to hear things hundreds of metres away all these incredible sounds might be lost he said This is the problem we hear so many noises that we stop listening For the past ten years the US National Park Service has recorded sound levels at more than 600 parks in the US including Yosemite in California Yellowstone and Denali in Alaska There was noise from human activity in all the parks for example aircraft motorbikes motorboats and tour buses Fristrups team say that noise pollution more than doubles every 30 years Its not surprising people put on earphones he said More background noise has the same effect on your hearing as fog has on your vision you are aware of only a small area around you he said Even in our cities there are

182,David Cameron Barack Obama and Pamela Anderson have refused George W Bush Benedict Cumberbatch and Stephen Hawking have taken part As the Ice Bucket Challenge notched up 100m for a US motorneuronedisease charity and 45m for a British one as well as thousands more for charities in Hong Kong and Australia the bracing cold water of a backlash has quickly followed Narcissistic celebrities showing off toned bodies people having all the fun without donating complaints about the waste of water the attacks have come from commentators animalrights groups and environmentalists And the US Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ALS Association which is not related to Britains MND Association also came under fire for the sixfigure salaries being paid to its top staff Meanwhile the challenge continues to grow For anyone unaware of how it works someone gives a short speech to camera about the charity then dumps a bucket of ice cubes in water over their head or gets a friend to do it before nominating three people to either do the same or donate It began in the US in July although whether it was on a golf course or a baseball field depends on which version you prefer and first appeared on mainstream American television on 15 July But the ALS Association has now been forced to withdraw an attempt to patent the phrase Ice Bucket Challenge after criticism We understand the publics concern and are withdrawing the trademark applications spokeswoman Carrie Munk said The ALS has yet to respond to criticism of its high overheads and wage bills The unfortunate coincidence that 31 August to 5 September was World Water Week with international delegates arriving in Stockholm to discuss the planets water crisis has not been lost on some The charity WaterAid is asking people to use recycled water from bathtubs or garden butts or to douse people with sea water Douglas Graham the MND Associations fundraising director said The backlash is to be expected but really this is just a wonderful windfall and were so grateful We didnt see it coming but suddenly the donations just started The boost is an enormous help to a small charity looking after sufferers of a debilitating littleunderstood disease that has no cure and kills five people a day in the UK Former Baywatch star Pamela Anderson a longstanding animalrights activist wrote an open letter to the ALS Association saying she could not support its record on animal experimentation A few US stars have rejected the challenge because of Californias drought Actor Matt Damon got around the problem by pulling up water from his toilets pointing out that much of the world had less clean drinking water available Actor Verne Troyer used milk again citing environmental reasons And the challenge has been blamed for causing a water shortage on the Scottish island of Colonsay after its 135 inhabitants picked up on the craze In Australia a TV anchorman apologized over his robust no thanks response to being nominated Lincoln Humphries had said Instead of pouring fresh water over your own head and wasting ice here is a list of charities helping communities in desperate need of money across the world Id like to nominate everyone everywhere who has more than they need to donate what they can to the people who need it most because that is what charity is about not putting yourself through mild discomfort with a bucket of icy water Another criticism has been that small charities wont be able to cope with the extra cash but the MND Association rejected this Oh we can cope here said Graham We fund worldclass research into the causes and ultimately to find a treatment or cure We provide care and support for 3500 people and they need it because this is such a rapidly progressing disease and its a costly one to manage Over 50 die within two years of diagnosis Its heartbreaking to see the decline in people we work with over just a few months But for many people with a connection to the disease the awareness that the challenge has created is as valuable as the cash Graham says it is priceless Normally the MND Association gets around 300000 hits a year on its website On a single day recently it had 330000 We couldnt have created this if wed tried Charities are all worthwhile causes and I understand even that some people might want to donate to a different one In 2013 British people gave 62bn to charity we should be proud of that Its fabulous for us to get this windfall Well be sitting down over the next few weeks to work out how to spend it in the best way but I assure you every penny will count for good,George W Bush Benedict Cumberbatch and Stephen Hawking have done it David Cameron Barack Obama and Pamela Anderson have refused to do it The Ice Bucket Challenge began in the US in July It has raised 100 million for the ALS Association an American motor neurone disease charity and 45 million for a British charity as well as thousands of pounds for charities in Hong Kong and Australia But some people are unhappy with the Ice Bucket Challenge Animalrights groups and environmentalists people who want to protect the natural world have criticized it Some people say it wastes water Other people criticize it because some people enjoy the fun and then do not donate anything to charity But the challenge continues to grow If you dont know how it works someone gives a short speech to camera about the charity then throws a bucket of ice cubes in water over their head or asks a friend to do it Then they give the names of three other people who have to do the same or donate money to the charity It was an unlucky coincidence that the Ice Bucket Challenge was happening during World Water Week when people from all over the world met in Stockholm to discuss the planets water crisis The charity WaterAid is asking people to use recycled water from their baths or rainwater from their gardens or to use sea water Douglas Graham of the UK Motor Neurone Association said We are not surprised about the criticism but this is a wonderful windfall and were so grateful We didnt expect it but suddenly the donations just started The money is a very big help to a small charity that looks after sufferers of a terrible disease that has no cure and kills five people a day in the UK Former Baywatch star and animalrights activist Pamela Anderson wrote a public letter to the ALS Association In the letter she said that she did not like the charitys use of animal experimentation A few US stars have rejected the challenge because of Californias drought Actor Matt Damon solved the problem by using water from his toilet Actor Verne Troyer used milk also for environmental reasons And some people say the challenge caused a water shortage on the Scottish island of Colonsay Another criticism is that small charities wont know what to do with the extra money but the MND Association rejects this Oh we know what to do with the extra money here said Graham We pay for research to find the causes of the disease and a treatment or cure We give care and support to 3500 people and they need it because this disease is expensive to manage More than 50 of people with the disease die within two years But for many people with a connection to the disease the awareness that the challenge has created is as important as the money Normally the MND Association gets about 300000 hits a year on its website On just one day recently it had 330000 hits It is great to donate to any charity I understand that some people might want to donate to a different charity said Graham In 2013 British people gave 62 billion to charity we should be proud of that Its fabulous for us to get this windfall Over the next few weeks we will decide how to spend the money in the best way,validation,ADV,ELE
