146,Illegal downloading is morally wrong and it is theft the same as putting your hand in someones pocket and stealing their wallet is theft says author Philip Pullman In an article for magazine Index on Censorship Pullman who is president of the Society of Authors strongly defends copyright laws He criticizes internet users who think it is OK to download music or books without paying for them The technology is so dazzling that people cant see that what theyre doing is wrong he writes It is outrageous that anyone can steal an artists work without punishment It is theft just as putting your hand in someones pocket and taking their wallet is theft His article comes after music industry leaders met British Prime Minister David Cameron in Downing Street to discuss the issue of web piracy Pullman writer of the His Dark Materials trilogy says authors and musicians work in poverty for years to bring their work to the level that gives happiness to their audiences and when they achieve that the possibility of making money from it is taken away from them He concludes If we want to enjoy the work that someone does we should pay for it Pullman is writing in the next issue of the campaign groups magazine in a dialogue with Cathy Casserly chief executive of Creative Commons Casserly argues that there is a lot wrong with copyright which was created a long time ago She writes Copyright closes the door on the many ways that people can share build upon and remix each others work possibilities that we could not imagine when those laws were made She says artists need to think creatively about how they earn money from their work Index on Censorship agrees The magazines editor Rachael Jolley said Existing copyright laws dont work in the digital age and they criminalize consumers We need new ideas for how artists writers and musicians can earn a living from their work Illegal downloading is a very big problem Between November 2012 and January 2013 in the UK 280 million music tracks were digitally pirated along with 52 million TV shows 29 million films18 million ebooks and 7 million software or games files 18 of internet users aged over 12 say they have pirated items and 9 say they are afraid they will get caught Pullman writes in his article The ease and speed with which people can get music in MP3 is still very surprising to people like me who have been building up their iTunes list for some time After the Downing Street meeting Cameron asked the Conservative MP Mike Weatherley to be his adviser on the subject The BPI an organization that supports music companies said Mike Weatherley is a strong supporter of copyright and the artists and creative producers its there to protect We hope his influence and the prime ministers support for copyright will change how we see illegal downloading in the UK,Illegal downloading is a kind of moral squalor and theft as much as putting your hand in someones pocket and stealing their wallet is theft says author Philip Pullman

58,In 2010 it was too dangerous for the police to enter the old part of the city of Srinagar in India Violent separatists were fighting for an independent Kashmir and they had killed more than 100 people there But things change very quickly The same streets are now full of tourists The mosque where young people threw stones at the security forces will soon be part of an official walking tour Visitors can take photos in the beautiful gardens by the lake During the winter the nearby ski resorts were full of rich Russians In 2002 only 27000 tourists came to visit the Kashmir Valley Others were scared because of the antiIndian fighting almost 70000 people have died during the fighting So far in 2012 almost one million people have visited the area this includes more than 23000 from outside India But fewer than 150 Britons visited mainly because the UK governments advice is that the area is too dangerous to visit Omar Abdullah the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir has asked the British government to change its advice but they havent changed it Its frustrating says Abdullah Today because of that travel advice peoples insurance isnt valid when they visit here 1995 was the last time foreign tourists were murdered in Kashmir when an Islamist group kidnapped six westerners and killed five of them British citizens have been killed more recently in other countries I mean how many British citizens were killed on 911 Did you stop people from visiting New York Youve lost them in Spain in Bali said Abdullah Weve lost Indians in London There is still a possibility that alQaida could do something stupid but we havent stopped Indians from travelling to London There is no reason to say Kashmir or even Srinagar is a dangerous destination Germany changed its guidelines for travellers to the region in 2011 Foreigners are usually not direct targets the new guidelines said less than a year after the fighting in 2010 A national holiday on 15 August celebrated 65 years of Indian independence in the past this was a dangerous day because many people in the state do not feel part of India But there was no trouble at the independence celebrations on Wednesday Abdullah says tourists are safe in Kashmir if they are careful In other words do not go trekking near the border that separates the Indian and Pakistani parts of Kashmir Some visitors may feel it is not right to have fun in a place where local people have very high levels of anxiety and lots of mental health problems But the local people in Srinagar like tourism Amjid Gulzar 26 said Abdullah should encourage foreign visitors Without tourism our economy will be in chaos he said We need better roads reliable electricity We need more things for tourists to do in the evening we dont even have one cinema in this city he said But will tourists feel welcome In June a local Islamic group wrote a dress code for foreign tourists Abdullah says Nobody wants tourists to come here and cover their faces But they should be sensitive to our cultural identity and dress appropriately I think thats common sense Abdullah said tourism would help the economy Kashmirs economy is weak after more than twenty years of fighting The state receives just 72 million each year in taxes but it pays 155 million in salaries to 500000 public employees It is clear why he needs to find more money He is pleased to see tourists back Im not saying that one million tourists here shows that everything is normal again he said But it gives me some satisfaction that people can come have a nice time and go back,In 2010 the police would only enter the old city in Srinagar wearing body armour It was at the centre of uprisings by violent separatists who were fighting for an independent Kashmir More than 100 people died How quickly things change The same streets are now full of tourists The Nowhatta mosque is where young people would meet to throw stones at the security forces Now the mosque will be part of an official walking tour focused on heritage crafts and markets Visitors can have their picture taken in the beautiful gardens by the lake Until the snow melted the ski resorts nearby were packed with rich Russians too In 2002 only just over 27000 tourists dared to visit the Kashmir Valley People were frightened by the antiIndian insurgency in which almost 70000 people have died So far in 2012 the area has received almost one million tourists more than 23000 of them from outside India But there were fewer than 150 Britons mainly because the UKs Foreign Office advice deters most travellers by giving a list of recent security problems in the region Omar Abdullah the UKborn Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir has asked the British High Commission in Delhi to change its guidelines but without success Its frustrating admitted Abdullah who has been in charge of Indias most sensitive state since early 2009 Today unfortunately as a result of that travel advice peoples insurance isnt valid when they visit here 1995 was the last time foreign tourists were murdered in JK Six westerners including two Britons were kidnapped by AlFaran a Kashmiri militant Islamist group Only one survived British citizens have been killed more recently in countries that you still havent stopped people from visiting I mean how many British citizens did you lose in 911 Did you stop people from visiting New York Youve lost them in Spain in Bali said Abdullah Weve lost Indians in London There is still a possibility that alQaida could do something stupid but we havent stopped Indians from travelling to London There is no reason to say Jammu and Kashmir or even Srinagar is an unsafe destination Germany relaxed its guidelines for travellers to the region in 2011 Foreigners are usually not direct targets said Germanys amended advice At the time many thought it was a bold thing to say less than a year after the 2010 disturbances finally calmed down There was a national holiday on 15 August to celebrate 65 years of Indian independence in the past a day fraught with danger in a state where many do not feel part of India But there was no trouble at the independence celebrations Abdullah is confident that tourists are safe in the state if you take the normal sort of precautions In other words do not go trekking near the border that separates the Indian and Pakistani controlled parts of Kasmir Syed Ali Shah Geelani leader of the proKashmiri independence party disagrees with Abdullahs politics But the two men agree about tourism At the start of the summer season Geelani wrote an open letter to tourists that said Whatever your faith whatever language you speak and to whatever region you belong you are our honoured guest and respecting and protecting guests is not only our moral obligation but an article of faith Some visitors may worry about the ethics of having fun in a place where the local people are suffering from record levels of anxiety and mental health problems But the locals in Srinagar seem to be in favour of tourism Amjid Gulzar 26 said Abdullah could search for truth and reconciliation as well as encouraging foreign visitors He must do both but without tourism our economy will be in chaos he said We need better infrastructure better roads reliable electricity We need more for tourists to do in the evening we dont even have one cinema in this city he said But will tourists feel welcome In June a local Islamic group created a dress code for foreign tourists Abdullah sighs when I mention this Nobody wants tourists to come here and cover their faces I think their basic point was be sensitive to our cultural identity and dress appropriately I think thats common sense Abdullah said tourism would help the economy JKs economy is in a dire state after more than two decades of conflict The state receives just 72 million each year in taxes but 155 million is paid in salaries to 500000 public employees It is clear why he needs to find more money fast But at the moment he is just pleased to see tourists backIm not suggesting that one million tourists here is a sign that everything is back to normal he said But it gives me some satisfaction that people

good quality What this person does Opens tins of dog or cat food smells it and eats it Tasting is an important quality check to make sure each different ingredient is perfectly balanced says Philip Wells the chief taster for Lilys Kitchen pet food Typical salary 20000 for a job in the quality department Worst part of the job The deadlines Wells says he likes the food The meat in pet food must come from animals that humans can safely eat He also says There are some terrible pet foods I dont taste them but just the smell makes you feel sick Job satisfaction Every day is different Wells likes knowing that he helps pets to become happier and healthier But he says that someone else in the tasting team is also a very important member Lily the dog 2 Hygiene technician The job To clean areas that might be dangerous to humans What this person does Cleans up crime scenes road accidents and suicides Clears houses full of rubbish rats and excrement and other things too The job is to keep people safe says Richard Lewis a hygiene technician for Rentokil We work in some very very dirty places Typical salary When you start the salary is usually around 14500 A top salary can be up to 22000 Worst part of the job Cleaning up after suicides You get used to the job being disgusting But the emotional side of the job is still hard he says You also need to have a sense of humour because some days can be difficult Job satisfaction Lewis finds the variety of tasks exciting One day Im cleaning up after a dead body another day Im in a prison cell Its satisfying to make a dangerous place safe again he says 3 Biogas engineer The job To set up biogas plants in developing countries What this person does Helps poor people produce biogas from their excrement and other waste products This is done by linking a system to toilets Poor people can use the gas for cooking and lighting Typical salary When you start the salary is around 10000 A typical salary for a chief technical officer is 30000 Worst part of the job For Baburam Paudel chief technical officer in Nepal for the charity Renewable World the worst part is seeing people struggling to survive on very little money Unsurprisingly the smell of the waste products can be disgusting It smells like rotten eggs Job satisfaction I find it very satisfying to know that I am helping people to earn more money and also allowing girls to go to school because they dont need to collect firewood says Paudel My work improves the health and hygiene of whole communities 4 Eel ecologist The job To help the critically endangered European eel to survive What this person does Checks the size of the endangered eels They do this by walking into the Thames and other London rivers which are full of eels In the rivers they put their hands into a net filled with up to 20 adult eels and pull an eel out Adult eels can be a metre long or even larger and weigh up to 2kg Theyre not dangerous but they are almost 100 muscle and they can be a little bit slimy says Stephen Mowat an eel ecologist for the Zoological Society of London We have to weigh and measure them and they wriggle a lot I look silly when Im crawling on the ground chasing an eel across the grass Worst part of the job Eels are really difficult animals to work with says Mowat But for Mowat the worst part o f the job is not the eels he believes baby eels are as cute as pandas The worst thing about the job is seeing how much damage humans do to the environment Job satisfaction Working outside and seeing British wildlife really close is the best part of the job says Mowat Eels are beautiful animals and working with eels helps whole river systems That is a great thing to do 5 Shopping channel presenter The job To sell and demonstrate lots of different products on live TV What this person does Presents hours and hours of boring TV and at the same time demonstrates the products and looks enthusiastic about everything that they are selling I prepare and research as much information as possible on every product says Shaun Ryan presenter for Ideal World TV Typical salary When you start the salary is a minimum of 30000 An experienced presenter can get over 55000 Worst part of the job Working at unusual hours of the day says Ryan An experienced presenter like me has to work weekends and very late evenings And sometimes I have to start work at five in the morning Job satisfaction I love presenting live TV and having to think quickly says Ryan I also love knowing that at times thousands of people are buying the product that I have just presented,We asked five people who do some unusual jobs how much they are paid what the worst parts are and why they enjoy their work 1 Dogfood taster The job Tasting dog food to make sure it meets a top brands quality standards What it involves Opening sample tins of each batch of dog or cat food smelling it and eating it Although dogs sense of taste is different from ours tasting is an important quality check to ensure each different ingredient is perfectly balanced in just the right way says Philip Wells the chief taster for Lilys Kitchen pet food Typical salary 20000 for an entrylevel job in the quality department However Wells says an experienced technical director can easily earn 50000 or more Worst part of the job The deadlines for Wells who admits he quite likes the food The meat used in pet food has to come from animals that are fit for human consumption under the Animal Feed Regulations 2010 He adds There are some pretty terrible pet foods out there and although I dont taste them the smell is enough to turn the stomach Job satisfaction No two days are ever the same Wells finds it rewarding that a project he has worked on will help pets to become happier and healthier However he acknowledges that some of the credit must go to another key member of the tasting team Lily the border terrier 2 Hygiene technician The job Disinfecting areas that might have been exposed to biohazardous situations What it involves Cleaning up crime scenes road accidents and suicides Clearing houses full of rubbish rats and excrement among other things The job is about keeping people safe says Richard Lewis a hygiene technician for Rentokil We deal with some extremely dirty sites Typical salary The entrylevel salary is usually around 14500 and a top salary can be up to 22000 Worst part of the job Cleaning up after suicides You get used to the job being disgusting but the emotional side of it is still hard he says You also need to have a sense of humour because some days can be difficult Job satisfaction Lewis finds the variety of tasks exciting One day Im cleaning up after a dead body another day Im in a prison cell or high in the air being lowered down into a silo to clean it He also takes pride in the changes he makes Its satisfying to make a hazardous site safe again And it benefits society 3 Biogas engineer The job Setting up biogas plants in developing countries What it involves Linking a system which can be filled with human excrement animal dung and other waste products to toilets to produce a biogas that can be used for cooking and lighting You have to know what size and shape the mixing pit needs to be how to create the best temperature for the process and where to build the biogas plant says Baburam Paudel chief technical officer in Nepal for the charity Renewable World Typical salary An entrylevel salary is around 10000 while a typical salary for a chief technical officer is 30000 Worst part of the job For Paudel its seeing people struggling to survive on very little income You have to be willing to get your hands dirty during the build process and inspections Unsurprisingly the anaerobic digestion the process that takes place when bacteria eat the waste and produce methane smells like rotten eggs It can be disgusting and there is no room for mistakes Job satisfaction I find it very satisfying to know that I am helping people to increase their incomes and allowing girls to go to school by replacing the need to collect firewood says Paudel My work improves the health and hygiene of whole communities 4 Eel ecologist The job Conserving the critically endangered European eel What it involves To monitor the size of the endangered eels ecologists walk into the Thames and other London rivers full of eels sometimes up to their armpits and reach into a net filled with up to 20 adult eels to take one out with their bare hands Adult eels can be a metre long or even larger and weigh up to 2kg Theyre not at all dangerous but they are almost pure muscle and they can be a little bit slimy says Stephen Mowat an eel conservationist and ecologist for the Zoological Society of London We have to weigh and measure them and they wriggle a lot Its difficult to look professional while crawling on the ground chasing an eel across the grass Worst part of the job Eels are really tricky creatures to work with says Mowat You also have to be ready to jump from one project to the next I once had to cut up some dead eels to examine parasites living in them moments before putting on a suit for a meeting But for Mowat the worst part of the job is definitely not handling the eels he believes baby eels known as elvers are as cute as pandas The worst thing about the job is regularly learning how much damage we are doing to the environment Job satisfaction Working outdoors and seeing British wildlife up close is the best part of the job says Mowat Eels are beautiful creatures and working with eels doesnt just benefit the eel it helps rivers and coastal areas That is something worth doing 5 Shopping channel presenter The job Selling and demonstrating a wide range of products on live TV What it involves Presenting hours and hours of monotonous TV while at the same time demonstrating the products and appearing to be enthusiastic and knowledgeable about everything that youre selling I prepare and research as much technical and practical information as possible on every single product beforehand says Shaun Ryan presenter for Ideal World TV Typical salary A trainee

156,A new scientific study says that global warming might make temperatures rise more than people think The scientist who led the research said that if emissions of greenhouse gases are not reduced the planet will be at least 4C warmer by 2100 This is twice the level the worlds governments consider to be dangerous The research shows that fewer clouds form as the planet warms This means that less sunlight reflects back into space and this makes temperatures even higher The way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery in the study of future climate change Professor Steven Sherwood at the University of New South Wales in Australia who led the research said that their work was new in two ways First it found what controls the cloud changes and second it did not accept the lowest estimates of future global warming it believed the higher more damaging estimates 4C would be catastrophic not simply dangerous Sherwood said For example it would make life difficult if not impossible in much of the tropics and it would guarantee the eventual melting of the Greenland ice sheet and some of the Antarctic ice sheet And if the ice sheets melt sea levels will rise by many metres The research helps to show how much warming is caused by rises in carbon emissions say scientists who have commented on the study published in the journal Nature Experts at Japans National Institute for Environmental Studies said the explanation of how fewer clouds form as the world warms was a good one They also agreed that this showed future climate change would be bigger than people think To measure the effect of greenhouse gases on the Earths climate scientists estimate what the rise in temperature would be with twice as much CO2 in the atmosphere as in the preindustrial age and this will probably happen within 50 years For twenty years those estimates have been from 15C to 5C a wide range The new research has reduced that range to between 3C and 5C by studying the biggest cause of uncertainty clouds Researchers use computer climate models to predict future temperatures and it was important to include the way clouds form in those models When water evaporates from the oceans the vapour can rise over nine miles to form rain clouds that reflect sunlight or it may rise just a few miles and fall slowly back down without forming clouds In reality both things happen and climate models that include the second possibility predict much higher future temperatures than the models that only include the ninemilehigh clouds Climate sceptics like to criticize climate models because they are sometimes wrong and we know that they are not perfect said Sherwood But we are finding that the mistakes are being made by the models that predict less warming not the models that predict more warming He added Sceptics may also point to the pause in the rise of temperatures since the end of the 20th century but there is more and more evidence that we cannot see this pause in other measures of the climate system And the pause is almost certainly temporary The worlds average air temperatures have increased quite slowly since a high point in 1998 which the ocean phenomenon El Nino caused But greenhouse gases are trapping more and more heat and over 90 disappears into the oceans Also a recent study suggested that it may seem there is a pause but this is only because we did not have temperature readings from polar regions where there is the most warming Sherwood accepts that his teams work on the role of clouds does not mean for sure that temperature rises will be in the higher range He added that a 4C rise in the worlds average temperatures would have a serious effect on the world and the economies of many countries if we do not reduce emissions,According to a new scientific study temperature rises caused by uncontrolled global warming could be at the high end of current estimates The scientist who led the research said that unless emissions of greenhouse gases are reduced the planet will heat up by a minimum of 4C by 2100 This is twice the level the worlds governments consider to be dangerous The research indicates that fewer clouds form as the planet warms which means less sunlight is reflected back into space This forces temperatures up even higher The way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery in the study of future climate change Professor Steven Sherwood at the University of New South Wales in Australia who led the new work said that the study broke new ground in two ways First it identified what controls the cloud changes and second it rejected the lowest estimates of future global warming and favoured the higher and more damaging estimates 4C would be catastrophic rather than simply dangerous Sherwood said For example it would make life difficult if not impossible in much of the tropics and would guarantee the eventual melting of the Greenland ice sheet and some of the Antarctic ice sheet with sea levels rising by many metres as a result The research reduces the uncertainty about how much warming is caused by rises in carbon emissions according to scientists commenting on the study published in the journal Nature Experts at Japans National Institute for Environmental Studies said the explanation of how fewer clouds form as the world warms was convincing and agreed that this indicated future climate change would be greater than expected Scientists measure the sensitivity of the Earths climate to greenhouse gases by estimating the temperature rise that would be caused by a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere compared with preindustrial levels which is likely to happen within 50 years For two decades those estimates have run from 15C to 5C wide range The new research narrowed that range down to between 3C and 5C by closely examining the biggest cause of uncertainty clouds Computer climate models are the only tool researchers have to predict future temperatures and it was important to make sure that the way clouds are formed was represented accurately in those models When water evaporates from the oceans the vapour can rise over nine miles to form rain clouds that reflect sunlight or it may rise just a few miles and drift back down without forming clouds In reality both processes happen and climate models that included the second possibility predicted significantly higher future temperatures than models that only included the ninemilehigh clouds Climate sceptics like to criticize climate models for getting things wrong and we are the first to admit they are not perfect said Sherwood But what we are finding is that the mistakes are being made by the models that predict less warming not those that predict more He added Sceptics may also point to the hiatus of temperatures since the end of the 20th century but there is increasing evidence that this hiatus is not seen in other measures of the climate system and is almost certainly temporary Global average air temperatures have increased quite slowly since a high point in 1998 which was caused by the ocean phenomenon El Nino But observations show that heat is continuing to be trapped in increasing amounts by greenhouse gases with over 90 disappearing into the oceans Furthermore a study in November 2013 suggested the pause may be mainly an illusion a result of the lack of temperature readings from polar regions where warming is greatest Sherwood accepts his teams work on the role of clouds cannot definitely rule out that future temperature rises will be at the lower end of projections But for that to be the case there would need to be some major missing ingredient for which there is currently no evidence He added that a 4C rise in global average temperatures would have a serious impact on the world and the economies of many countries if emissions were not reduced,validation,ELE,INT
49,The critics usually analyse the novels of wellknown British author David Mitchell in detail But he is not worried about the critics this time He completed his latest book at 1am one Tuesday morning before a car arrived to take him to the airport to catch a flight to Norway No one will see this novel until 2114 Mitchell is the second author to be part of the Future Library project For the project they planted 1000 trees in 2014 in Oslos Nordmarka forest The first author Margaret Atwood gave the manuscript of a text called Scribbler Moon to the project in 2015 Each year for the next hundred years an author will write a novel that people will only read in 2114 when the trees are cut down to make paper to make the books Each author will travel to the place in the forest high above Oslo where they will give their manuscripts to the project in a short ceremony Its a little bit of hope at a time when there is lots of very depressing news It shows that we have a chance of civilization in a hundred years said Mitchell Everything is telling us that were doomed but the Future Library brings hope that we are stronger than we think that we will be here that there will be trees that there will be books and readers and civilization Mitchell said that writing this book made him feel free because I wont be around to know if people think its good or bad But before me was Margaret Atwood and next year Im sure there will be another brilliant writer So my book had better be good I would look such a fool if they opened my book in 2114 and it wasnt any good Mitchell says that he usually polishes and polishes his writing I polish too much But this was very different I wrote till the final minute So the first twothirds are polished and the final third I didnt have time And I felt free The creator of the Future Library asked writers to write on the theme of imagination and time Mitchell revealed only the name of the manuscript From Me Flows What You Call Time during a ceremony in the Norwegian woods next to where the 1000 trees are planted The title comes from a piece of music by Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu Mitchell only told us that his book is longer than I thought it would be He said nothing more In the forest Mitchell read a short story and a poem This small section of forest will be carefully managed for the next 98 years before it becomes Future Librarys manuscripts How vain to think my writing will be of interest to future generations But it is the opposite of vain to work hard on a manuscript that nobody will ever congratulate you for and say Good job or I loved the bit where she did that and he did this Mitchell wrote They will seal his manuscript and put it next to Atwoods manuscript in a room in Oslos new public library which will open in 2019 The manuscript is now says the author gone from me like a coin Ive dropped in a river,Wellknown British author David Mitchell is used to the critics analysing his novels in detail So its a relief he says that his latest work wont be seen by anyone until 2114 He completed it at 1am one Tuesday morning before a car arrived to take him to the airport to catch a flight to Norway Mitchell is the second contributor to the Scottish artist Katie Patersons Future Library project for which 1000 trees were planted in 2014 in Oslos Nordmarka forest The first author Margaret Atwood handed over the manuscript of a text called Scribbler Moon in 2015 Each year for the next 100 years an author will deliver a piece of writing that will only be read in 2114 when the trees are chopped down to make paper on which the 100 texts will be printed Each author their names revealed year by year and chosen by a panel of experts and Paterson while she is alive will travel to the spot in the forest high above Oslo where they will hand over their manuscripts in a short ceremony Its a little glimmer of hope in a season when there has been lots of very depressing news which shows that we are in with a chance of civilization in a hundred years said Mitchell Everything is telling us that were doomed but the Future Library brings hope that we are more resilient than we think that we will be here that there will be trees that there will be books and readers and civilization Mitchell said he found writing the book quite liberating because I wont be around to take the consequences of this being good or bad But Im sandwiched between Margaret Atwood and no doubt some other brilliant writer So it had better be good Id look such a fool if they opened it in 2114 and it wasnt any good Mitchell says that he usually polishes and polishes his writing Actually I overpolish But this was very different I wrote till the final minute So the first twothirds were polished and the final third I didnt have time And it was a liberation Future Library creator Paterson asked the writers to write on the theme of imagination and time which they can take in so many directions Mitchell revealed only the name of the manuscript From Me Flows What You Call Time during a ceremony in the Norwegian woods next to where Patersons 1000 trees are planted The title is taken from a piece of music by Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu But other than admitting that its more substantial than I was expecting the author would say nothing more Handing over his text in the forest Mitchell read his audience of children and adults a short story and William Wordsworths A slumber did my spirit seal Its ending Rolled round in earths diurnal course With rocks and stones and trees felt appropriate in this small section of forest which will be carefully tended to for the next 98 years before it is turned into Future Librarys manuscripts How vain to think that my scribblings will be of enduring interest to future generations Yet how lowkey and understated to slave over a manuscript that nobody will ever congratulate you for and say Nice one or God I loved the bit where she did that and he did this Mitchell wrote in a piece for the Future Library His manuscript now delivered will be sealed and placed alongside Atwoods in a woodlined room in Oslos new public library which will open in 2019 Watched over by

thousands of supporters from around the world who have made the beach into a party zone Some danced some took photos some drank but mostly they just walked and talked about football waiting for the next game to begin on the big screen nearby The friendly mostly peaceful mood was very different from the protests transport chaos and stadium problems during the preparations for the World Cup But now the football has started visiting supporters want to enjoy the experience If I knew when I started planning how complicated and expensive it would be I wouldnt have come But now that were here its great said Brian Hill another England fan The trip has not been without its problems Hill travelled for more than 20 hours to get to Rio His sons sunglasses were stolen almost as soon as he sat on the beach And they have been surprised that many bars do not have big screens for the games But like many fans they said they loved the atmosphere of this tournament which has had a spectacular start Everyone enjoyed Robin van Persies extraordinary diving header for the Netherlands against Spain And there have been lots of goals 28 in the rst eight games almost three times as many as at the same stage in South Africa in 2010 LatinAmerican teams have been very successful so far and as most fans are from neighbouring countries this has added to the carnival atmosphere Up to now the tournament has avoided the problems many people predicted though it is not trouble free The stadiums were delivered late and in some cases not fully nished but there have been no structural problems or dif culties entering the grounds As at previous World Cups ticketing has been a problem with many empty seats at several games FIFA spokesman SaintClair Milesi said that only 48000 of the 51900 seats were lled at the game between the Netherlands and Spain The Globo newspaper listed a number of problems in the 12 host cities Almost all had worse traf c jams than usual The worst transport problems were in Natal where bus drivers were on strike In Salvador some journey times were ve times longer than usual Traf c was already bad but this week it is chaotic said Jecilda Mello a local person But protests have happened less often since the opening day when small demonstrations took place in several cities and police used pepper spray Since then the only security problem has been petty theft and overexcited fans Police used pepper spray on Argentinian fans when they started a spontaneous street party and blocked roads The huge distances have created some very different World Cup experiences The tournament has had only a small effect on Sao Paulo South Americas biggest city But far away in Manaus the remote Amazonian city where England played Italy visitors said there was World Cup fever with brightly decorated streets and ags on many cars The English Football Association chairman Greg Dyke said there was a big difference in atmosphere Weve had a really warm welcome in Manaus Its a big thing for them But we were in Sao Paulo for four or ve days before the rst match and it was hard to see until the last day that the World Cup was happening It was weird,There are

Liverpool was in a good mood The place is lovely The people are great Theres a party atmosphere said McDowell The only thing that could be better is the England team He and half a dozen friends are among the thousands of supporters from around the world who have made the beach into a party zone of national colours and chants Some danced some posed for photos some drank but mostly they just walked and talked football waiting for the next game to begin on the nearby big screen The last time there were so many people here during the daytime the pope was visiting The cheerful largely

109,The view from the visitors centre in the Donana National Park in southern Spain is a bird watchers dream 200000 hectares of wetlands vital for the birds of western Europe Many of Britains most loved migratory birds rest here every year on their migrations from Africa Donana is also home to some of Europes rarest birds including the Spanish imperial eagle It is a beautiful landscape but it is under threat In 1998 almost two billion gallons of toxic water full of acid and waste metals poured into the park from the Los Frailes mine 45km away They collected more than 25000 kilos of dead sh afterwards and nearly 2000 adult birds chicks eggs and nests were killed or destroyed It was Spains worst environmental disaster and the cleanup cost 90 million Spain realized that Donana is the nations most important natural site so the country decided to spend an extra 360 million on restoring the landscape to its original wetland state It has been an expensive process And Donana is still under threat from the pressures of modern life There are plans to build an oil pipeline through Donana and there is also an idea to build new hotels and golf courses which would use a lot of local water Sand and soil washed from nearby farms is also blocking the channels that cross the park But the biggest shock has been the recent decision of the Andalucian government to reopen the Frailes mine that nearly destroyed Donana in 1998 This is Europes most important bird sanctuary says Laurence Rose of the RSPB Royal Society for the Protection of Birds Donana already faces a lot of threats but now they want to bring back the cause of the disaster 16 years ago It is extremely worrying If you look at the state of the local economy you quickly see why the government has made this decision The crash of Spains banks in 2008 had a very bad effect on the region Unemployment in some parts of Andalucia is now more than 30 If they reopen the mine it would create more than 1000 jobs There are riches here riches that the local inhabitants badly need said energy spokesman Vicente Fernandez Guerrero We think mining is a good way to make it possible to allow local people to continue to live in the area This is a mining area People have mined metals here since Roman times Fernandez said that the mine licence would only allow modern mining techniques which do not create poisonous wet waste They will use the best technology in the world here Fernandez said They will not use liquid We will not allow that Some people agree with the idea but a lot of people disagree with it Carlos Davila who works for the Spanish Ornithological Society in Donana was also alarmed at the idea This is a very very bad idea he said They say the new mine will be safe but they said it was safe in 1998 and look what happened We got the worst ecological disaster in the history of Spain Almost every visitor at a local restaurant had a camera and telescopic lens or a pair of binoculars Lots of tourists come to Donana because of the birdlife This is not surprising for this is a truly special place A big sky hangs over this at but dramatic landscape Birds of every shape and size ll the air and sometimes the road At one point on my visit a stork calmly stood in front of our car until it felt ready to y off The trouble is that Spain does not have the public resources it had 16 years ago A repeat of the disaster today would have a much much more damaging impact said Rose Davila agrees After the disaster Spain realized that it had a place of real ecological importance and did a lot to clean it up and protect it he added Now it seems we have forgotten that lesson It is very depressing,The view from the visitors centre at the southern edge of Donana National Park in southern Spain is an ornithologists dream 200000 hectares of wetlands vital for the birdlife of western Europe Dozens of Britains most loved migratory birds rest here every year on their migrations from Africa Donana is also home to some of Europes rarest birds including the Spanish imperial eagle It is a glorious vibrant landscape but it exists on a knifeedge In 1998 almost two billion gallons of acidic water mixed with waste metals poured into the park from the Los Frailes mine 45km away A toxic tsunami of waste poured down the Guadiamar river into the park More than 25000 kilos of dead sh were collected afterwards and nearly 2000 adult birds chicks eggs and nests were killed or destroyed It was Spains worst environmental disaster and the cleanup cost 90m Suddenly aware of Donanas status as the nations most important natural site Spain decided to spend a further 360m some of it EU money on restoring the landscape In the 1950s and 60s some parts of this landscape had been drained to create rice and cotton elds Some of this farmland is now being returned to its original wetland state It has been a costly but positive process But Donana is still in trouble thanks to the increasing pressures of modern life There are plans to build an oil pipeline through Donana and other developers want to build new hotels and golf courses which would need enormous water supplies Sand and soil washed from nearby farms is also blocking the channels that cross Donana However the real body blow for conservationists has been the recent decision of the Andalucian government to reopen the Frailes mine that nearly destroyed Donana in 1998 This is Europes most precious bird sanctuary for indigenous species and also as a resting place for birds that migrate between Africa and Britain and other parts of northwest Europe says Laurence Rose of the RSPB Royal Society for the Protection of Birds Donana already faces a large number of threats but now they want to bring back the very cause of the disaster 16 years ago It is extremely worrying The state of the local economy provides an explanation for the governments decision The crash of Spains banks in 2008 had a catastrophic effect on the region and unemployment in some parts of Andalucia is now more than 30 Reopening the mine would provide more than 1000 jobs There are riches here riches that are badly needed by local inhabitants said energy spokesman Vicente Fernandez Guerrero We think mining is a good way to make it possible to allow local people to continue to live in the area This is a mining area People have been digging metals here since Roman times Fernandez said that the mine licence would only allow modern mining techniques which avoid the creation of poisonous wet waste Also the Canadian company that ran Los Frailes when the disaster happened cannot run it again The best technology in the world will be used here Fernandez insisted Liquid will not be used We are going to insist on that The plan has some support in the area but it also has a lot of opposition Carlos Davila who works for the Spanish Ornithological Society in Donana was also alarmed at the plan This is a very very bad idea he said They say the new mine will be safe but they said it was safe in 1998 and look what happened We got the worst ecological disaster in the history of Spain Almost every visitor at a local restaurant had a camera and telescopic lens or a pair of binoculars There is a big tourist trade because of the birdlife of Donana This is not surprising because this is a very special place A huge sky hangs over this

trouble is that Spain does not have the public resources it had 16 years ago A repeat of the toxin spill today would have a much much more damaging impact said Rose This point is supported by Davila

100,McDonalds is the worlds biggest burger chain and a symbol of American consumer capitalism But these days the golden arches of McDonalds are not looking so golden The company has got much bigger since 2003 but now the numbers of customers are falling McDonalds says that its worldwide sales have fallen by 33 The company has problems almost everywhere In China sales fell by 23 In Europe sales fell by 4 mostly because of problems in Ukraine and the antiwestern mood in Russia Health inspectors have investigated around 200 of McDonalds 450 restaurants in Russia and they have closed ten restaurants But the worst crisis is in the US where McDonalds has around 40 of its restaurants Almost 60 years since Ray Kroc opened his rst restaurant in Des Plaines Illinois consumers are losing their appetite for a Big Mac and fries Sales have fallen every month for 12 months in the US Many younger diners are eating at rival companies such as Chipotle Mexican Grill The number of 19to21yearolds who visit McDonalds once a month has fallen by 13 since 2011 Another problem is that McDonalds hamburgers were recently named the worst in America in a poll of more than 32000 American diners they said they would rather eat a burger at Five Guys Smashburger or Fuddruckers Many people also believe that McDonalds is less healthy than most of its rivals especially Chipotle Chipotle uses antibioticfree meat and locally sourced seasonal ingredients McDonalds asked customers for their opinions in the US in October Someone asked Have you ever used pink slime in your burgers pink slime is the beef ller that is used for dog food McDonalds stopped using this meat product in 2012 but McDonalds Chief Executive Don Thompson said the company still had to improve peoples opinions about the freshness and quality of its ingredients McDonalds has always had a reputation for fast service at low prices But since it introduced 2 items on its dollar menu people think it is more expensive than its rivals and many consumers complain that service is slower But Mary Chapman at food analysts Technomic said that it wasnt fair to say that McDonalds was more expensive than its rivals Prices have gone up but they havent gone up as quickly as the rest of the fastfood chains in the US Prices at McDonalds have increased by 48 since 2009 much less than the fastfood average up 194 But people are right when they complain that the queues are longer McDonalds has a bigger menu than some other restaurants with more complicated items its chicken McWrap takes 60 seconds to make I think it is worth waiting but the guy behind me who wants his double cheeseburger for a dollar might not said Chapman McDonald managers are promising to improve peoples opinions about its food in the US Thompson has promised more organic food and build your own burgers But to reduce queues he also wants to introduce simpler menus How can the company have simpler menus and at the same time a larger selection of llings They want to simplify the menu but also offer build your own burgers that sounds tricky said consumer expert Mark Kalinowski Only four out of McDonalds 14000 US restaurants have tested build your own burger he said Right now we are sceptical we would like to see more detail Sales are falling but McDonalds continues to expand around the world by the end of 2014 it expects to open 1400 new restaurants Kalinowski thinks that McDonalds sales will continue to fall but he thinks it will be number one for many years,McDonalds is the worlds biggest burger chain and a global emblem of American consumer capitalism But these days the golden arches of McDonalds are looking a little tarnished After a decade of expansion customers around the world dont seem to be lovin it any more McDonalds has revealed that worldwide sales dropped by 33 from 2013 The set of results were described as awful The company has problems almost everywhere In China sales fell by 23 because local media showed workers at a local supplier claiming to use outofdate beef and chicken in McDonalds and KFC products In Europe sales are down by 4 mostly because of problems in Ukraine and the antiwestern mood in Russia Around 200 of McDonalds 450 restaurants in Russia are being investigated by health inspectors and ten have been closed But it is in the US where McDonalds has around 40 of its restaurants where the crisis is deepest Almost 60 years since Ray Kroc opened his rst restaurant in Des Plaines Illinois consumers are losing their appetite for a Big Mac and fries McDonalds has seen 12 straight months of falling sales in its massive home market with sales down 41 in the latest quarter Younger diners are deserting the restaurant in droves to eat out at rivals such as Chipotle Mexican Grill The number of 19to21yearolds visiting McDonalds once a month has fallen by 13 since 2011 To add to the companys problems McDonalds hamburgers were recently named the worst in America in a poll of more than 32000 American diners who said they would rather eat a burger at Five Guys Smashburger or Fuddruckers McDonalds is also widely perceived as less healthy than most of its rivals especially Chipotle with its antibioticfree meat and locally sourced seasonal produce although local can mean 350 miles away The depth of consumer mistrust of McDonalds was exposed by a consumer outreach exercise the company launched in the US in October Have you ever used pink slime in your burgers was one question on the Our Food Your Questions website this refers to the controversial beef ller used for dog food that is sprayed with ammonia to make it t for human consumption McDonalds has not used the meat product since 2012 but Chief Executive Don Thompson acknowledged the company had a job to do in addressing misconceptions about the freshness and quality of its ingredients Yet just as McDonalds has been losing the customers who will pay a bit more for food they think is fresher and healthier it has also lost its edge in fastfood essentials speedy service at low prices Ever since it introduced 2 items on its dollar menu it has gained a reputation for being more expensive than its rivals while many consumers complain that service is slower The expensive tag was unjusti ed said Mary Chapman at food analysts Technomic Prices have indeed gone up but they havent gone up as quickly as the rest of the fastservice chains in the US Prices at McDonalds have increased by 48 since 2009 well below the fastfood average up 194 and the cost of fast casual eating a category that includes Chipotle is up 169 US consumer prices rose 11 over the same period But critics are not wrong about the longer queues McDonalds has a bigger menu than some with more complicated items its chicken McWrap takes 60 seconds to make I think it is worth waiting but the guy behind me who wants his double cheeseburger for a dollar might not said Chapman In the UK McDonalds has turned around its business which makes Britain a rare bright spot for the company A competitive breakfast menu improved coffee and free wi have given McDonalds a broad appeal in the UK said consultant Peter Martin adding that 56 of British adults have visited a McDonalds restaurant at least once in the last six months Executives are promising to fight misconceptions about its food in its home market Thompson has promised more organic food and custommade burgers but to cut down queues he also wants to introduce simpler menus Analysts are not sure how the company can solve the problem of simpler menus and greater choice over filings They want to simplify the menu but enhance its ability to customize and that sounds tricky said Mark Kalinowski at Janney Capital Markets Only four out of McDonalds 14000 US restaurants had so far tested build your own burger he said Right now we are sceptical we would like to see more detail Meanwhile despite the declining sales the chain continues to expand globally by the end of 2014 it expects to have 1400 new restaurants Kalinowski expects McDonalds market share will continue to shrink but he too warned against writing off the company We think it will be number one for not just years but decades to come,validation,ELE,INT
110,More than 100000 people went onto the streets in Brazil to show their anger at violent police poor public services and high costs for the World Cup The demonstrations in Rio de Janeiro So Paulo Brasilia Belem Belo Horizonte and Salvador started peacefully but there were some clashes with police and people set fire to cars and buses People complained that police used rubber bullets tear gas and violent beatings Happening at the start of the football Confederations Cup the rallies brought together people who are angry with the high costs and poor quality of public services the large amounts of money spent on international sporting events low standards of health care inequality and corruption Most of the demonstrations were peaceful but several police were hurt at least one car was burned and windows were broken People were demonstrating for different reasons We are here because we hate the government They do nothing for us said Oscar Jos Santos 19 years old Im an architect but I have been unemployed for six months There must be something wrong with this country said Nadia al Husin At a smaller rally in Brasilia demonstrators entered the highsecurity area of the national congress Several climbed onto the roof In Belo Horizonte police clashed with protesters who tried to get into a football stadium where there was a Confederations Cup match between Nigeria and Tahiti In Porto Alegre demonstrators set fire to a bus and in Curitiba protesters tried to enter the office of the state governor There were also rallies in Belem Salvador and other places In So Paulo there were large groups of people but the marches were peaceful Most protesters were young and for many it was their first experience of such a giant rally My generation has never experienced this said Thiago Firbida a student Since the dictatorship Brazilians have never demonstrated like this They did not believe they had a reason to But now Brazil once again has problems with a constant rise in prices so people are finally reacting Brazils demonstrations have been given special names the vinegar revolution because police arrested people for carrying vinegar to stop the effects of tear gas the 20cent revolution because of the bus price rise and the Passe Livre because of the demand for free public transport Some said the protests did not feel Brazilian but they were liberating Our politicians need to see the strength we have as one people Brazilians are usually too nice they enjoy partying not protesting but something is changing said Deli Borsari a 53yearold yoga teacher After people heard about the costs of new and improved stadiums on the news the Confederations Cup football tournament has been one of the reasons for the protests Before Saturdays match in Brasilia groups of demonstrators were dispersed by riot police Frightened Japanese supporters ran from the area holding their children when they heard shots perhaps rubber bullets or tear gas Another protest march near Rios Maracana Stadium also had a heavy police response President Dilma Rousseff believes peaceful protests are correct and proper for a democracy and that it is natural for young people to demonstrate But people booed the president at the opening ceremony for the Confederations Cup She will have serious political problems both now and in 2014 when Brazil will host the World Cup and also have an election,Brazil experienced one of its biggest nights of protest in decades as more than 100000 people took to the streets to express their frustration at aggressive policing poor public services and high costs for the World Cup The major demonstrations in Rio de Janeiro So Paulo Brasilia Belem Belo Horizonte Salvador and elsewhere started peacefully but several led to clashes with police and arson attacks on cars and buses People complained during previous smaller protests against bus price increases that police responded disproportionately with rubber bullets tear gas and violent beatings The rallies came at the same time as the start of the football Confederations Cup The rallies brought together people who are frustrated with the rising costs and poor quality of public services large amounts of money being spent on international sporting events low standards of health care and wider unease about inequality and corruption The vast majority of demonstrations were peaceful but several police were injured at least one car was overturned and burned and windows were smashed The unrest increased during the night as a large crowd set several fires outside a government office smashed the buildings windows and painted graffiti on the walls that said Revolution Down with Paes down with Cabral the mayor and state governor and Hate police Police inside responded with pepper spray The reasons people were protesting varied widely We are here because we hate the government They do nothing for us said Oscar Jos Santos a 19 year old Im an architect but I have been unemployed for six months There must be something wrong with this country said Nadia al Husin At a far smaller rally in Brasilia demonstrators broke through police lines to enter the highsecurity area of the national congress Several climbed onto the roof In Belo Horizonte police clashed with protesters who tried to get into a football stadium which was hosting a Confederations Cup match between Nigeria and Tahiti In Porto Alegre demonstrators set fire to a bus and in Curitiba protesters tried to force their way into the office of the state governor There were also rallies

My generation has never experienced this said Thiago Firbida a student Since the dictatorship Brazilians never bothered to demonstrate like this They did not believe they had a reason to But now Brazil is once again in crisis with a constant rise in prices so people are finally reacting Comparisons have been drawn with rallies in Turkey and elsewhere You could see another global link in the demonstrators who wore Guy Fawkes masks associated with Anonymous and the Occupy Wall Street protests Brazils demonstrations are being referred to as the vinegar revolution after police arrested people for carrying vinegar to fight the effects of tear gas as well as the 20cent revolution due to the bus price rise and the Passe Livre after the demand for free public transport Some said the protests felt unBrazilian but liberating Our politicians need to see the strength we have as one people Brazilians are too nice sometimes they enjoy partying rather than protesting but something is

140,Roger McKinlay is the former president of the Royal Institute of Navigation He says that our use of GPS global positioning system technology is damaging our ability to nd our way If we do not look after them we will lose our natural navigation abilities because we rely on technology more and more he wrote McKinlay believes it will take a lot of time and money before navigation systems will be good enough for technologies such as driverless cars to become successful He says we need better research into systems for navigation Also children should learn to nd their way using more traditional methods Schools should teach navigation and map reading he wrote In 2012 39 of adults in the UK had a smartphone In 2015 66 of adults had a smartphone So most people now use GPS technology But McKinlay a satellite communication and navigation consultant believes that we should be careful not to only use our smartphones for navigation If we dont practise using our navigation skills we will lose them he wrote Research from 2009 supports this idea We studied a group of current London taxi drivers and a group of retired London taxi drivers said Dr Hugo Spiers of University College London who is an author of the study The results showed that the retired taxi drivers did worse on navigation tests than the current drivers We were able to show that their abilities decreased after they stopped using their knowledge Spiers also believes it is dangerous to rely on technologies like GPS But he says that the biggest problem is that technologies can lead drivers into dangerous situations One of the deaths caused by satnavs satellite navigation was of a driver who in 2010 drove into a lake in Spain It can be dangerous to use a satnav said Spiers The way we use navigation technology also has an impact on our own abilities says Spiers If drivers listen to instructions they dont need to think about where they are going he says but the use of smartphone apps as digital maps is better When you use digital maps you have to think hard about where you are going he said McKinlay believes there have to be big improvements in navigation technologies before we can have futuristic things like driverless cars and smart cities For really important jobs like landing aeroplanes or ying aeroplanes GPS is still not good enough he said McKinlay believes humans must still able to take control of their navigation We dont want people to go into total shock when their smartphone disappears or the battery goes at he said Technology isnt magic it is just a tool,Former president of the Royal Institute of Navigation Roger McKinlay says that our use of GPS global positioning system technology could be damaging our innate ability to nd our way If we do not look after them our natural navigation abilities will deteriorate as we rely more and more on technology he wrote McKinlay believes we need huge investment before navigation systems will be good enough for technologies such as autonomous vehicles to take off In the meantime he says we need better research into systems for navigation Also children should be encouraged to learn how to nd their way around by more traditional means Schools should teach navigation and map reading as life skills he wrote According to Ofcom the Of ce of Communications around 66 of adults in the UK owned a smartphone in 2015 up from 39 in 2012 so GPS technology is widely available But McKinlay a satellite communication and navigation consultant believes that we should be careful not to leave our navigational needs to our devices If we dont practise using our navigation skills well lose them he wrote Not many scienti c studies have explored the issue but research from 2009 supports his ideas We looked at a group of current London taxi drivers and a group of London taxi drivers that had been retired for about four years said neuroscientist Dr Hugo Spiers of University College London who is an author of the study The results showed that the retired taxi drivers performed worse on navigation tests than the current taxi drivers We were able to show that their abilities dropped away if they werent using their knowledge Spiers also believes there is a danger in relying on technologies like GPS but he points out that the biggest problem is that technologies can lead drivers into dangerous situations One of the deaths caused by satnavs satellite navigation devices was of a driver whose car plunged into a lake in Spain in 2010 There is a genuine potential danger in relying on a satnav said Spiers But the health risk of not using your brain effectively is not known The way in which navigational technology is used could also affect its impact on our own abilities says Spiers Audio instructions to drivers remove the need to think about navigation he says but the use of smartphone apps as digital maps is very different When you use a digital map you have to think hard about where you are going and interact with this device he said The modern technology isnt just dumbing us down completely McKinlay believes there have to be big improvements in navigation technologies before futuristic scenarios of driverless cars and smart cities become a reality For really important jobs like landing aircraft or navigating aircraft GPS is still not good enough he said Spiers believes the development of arti cial intelligence based on machine learning could lead to a new wave of navigational aids but McKinlay is sceptical We will see eversmarter machines which are very very task speci c but the big breakthrough will be when they understand what we are thinking and what we want to achieve he said Ultimately McKinlay believes its essential that humans remain able to take control of their navigation Do you really want to encourage people to a point where when it disappears or when the battery goes at they are in total shock and can do nothing he said Technology isnt magic it is just a tool,validation,ELE,INT

116,It is no longer legal to smoke a cigarette inside a bar in the worlds drinking capital New Orleans Louisiana Since Hurricane Katrina in 2005 New Orleans city government has begun trying to reduce noise problems The city is now stricter on noise in bars and nightclubs and at the same time it has introduced new rules on noise It is the wrong time for this complains barowner William Walker He hates the antismoking law If they force people outside the bar to smoke it is going to increase the tension thats already there Many of New Orleanss best bars are in quiet neighbourhoods Martha Wood lives beside a loud bar that has live music The bar was one reason I bought the house so I wont ever complain about the noise says Wood She also manages a livemusic bar The Maple Leaf club became smokefree in 2014 Another club also became smokefree because performers asked for smokefree nights A lot of the performance venues were already starting to show that consideration to performers I wish the city had just let that happen not force the ban into every bar that doesnt have music says Zalia BeVille manager of the All Ways Lounge Luckily All Ways has an outdoor patio Another bar Lost Love Lounge doesnt have a patio The owner Geoff Douville loves the ban before he felt forced to live with smoke to keep his bar popular I couldnt ban smoking in my bar without a ban in the whole city says Douville People think I have that choice But if I make a nosmoking rule they will choose another bar with smoking Many small business owners also fear that the smokefree rule will make them lose money Neil Timms owns an English pub and saw a smoking ban before in England Back home in England every pub I knew closed because of the smoking ban remembers Timms of Englands ban which began in 2007 To avoid the same problems hes spending money to build a patio But Douville feels the ban could be a great business opportunity There are lots of people who would enjoy coming to our bar but they never came because they didnt want to smell like smoke for the next seven days now those people can come Douville isnt worried about noise complaints No court is going to say a bar is a nuisance after the city has introduced a smoking ban that forces you to go outside he says Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell who introduced the ban disagrees The responsibility is on the barowner to keep their customers respectful outside as well she says The owners need to tell them to go and have a smoke but be respectful to their communities The idea that we cant have clean air because it will cause noise problems is ridiculous We can have clean air without noise problems I think its about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses Many people were worried that the police would not have time to give bars warnings and nes So the health department will do it Bar customers must ll out a form or call 311 and include photographs of illegal smoking Geoff Douville says that hes used to noise complaints You will see the neighbours who complain about the noise now are going to be the same ones who wanted the smoking ban Of course theyre going to complain he adds But it doesnt mean theyre going to win,It is no longer legal to smoke a cigarette inside a bar in the worlds drinking capital New Orleans Louisiana Many other cities have banned indoor smoking but New Orleans is different it attracts tourists with a let the good times roll attitude An indoor smoking ban in New Orleans could have unique consequences Since Hurricane Katrina in 2005 New Orleans city government has begun trying to turn down the volume a bit With the support of neighbourhood groups the city has begun policing bars and nightclubs more strictly while at the same time ghting to implement a new noise ordinance This is just the wrong time for something like this complains barowner William Walker who hates the antismoking law Forcing people outside the bar to smoke is going to increase the tension thats already there Many of New Orleanss best bars and live music venues are in quiet residential neighbourhoods This neighbourly coexistence is a big part of what makes New Orleans different and charming But recently this unique social contract has become unacceptable for some people and the fate of New Orleanss musical personality feels at risk Martha Wood lives beside a loud bar that hosts live music I bought the house partly because of the bar so I wont ever complain about the noise says Wood who also manages a livemusic bar This bar became one of New Orleanss rst ever bars legally banned from serving drinks to go after a series of noise issues in 2013 including complaints about the loud smokers outside The Maple Leaf club went smokefree voluntarily in 2014 The same happened at another club where artists had been demanding smokefree nights A lot of the performance venues were already starting to show that consideration to performers so I wish the city would have just let that happen instead of forcing the ban into every corner bar that doesnt host music says Zalia BeVille manager of the All Ways Lounge Luckily All Ways has an outdoor patio unlike Lost Love Lounge whose owner Geoff Douville loves the ban hed previously felt forced to live with smoke to keep his bar going Theres no way I could have banned smoking in my bar without a ban throughout the whole city says Douville People act like I have that choice as a business owner But if I make that rule customers walk down the block to a bar with smoking Many small business owners also fear smoke free revenue loss Smoker Neil Timms owns an English pub and met the smoking ban before in England Back home in England every pub I knew closed within a year of the smoking ban remembers Timms of the UKs ban begun in 2007 He doesnt want his pub to close so hes spending money to build a patio But Douville feels the ban could be a great business opportunity There are lots of people who would enjoy coming out to our bar with our food but would never come because they didnt want to smell like smoke for the next seven days were now an option for all those people Nor does Douville worry about noise complaints No court is going to say a bar is a nuisance after the city has rati ed a smoking ban that requires you to go outside he says Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell who introduced the ban

partnerships between the communities and the businesses Cantrell recognizes that the city is different How is New Orleans different from the rest of the country New Orleans is known as a place where you can relax and have fun she says New Orleans needs to stand up and say We care about our people The most vulnerable people who are working in smoky conditions are the backbone of our hospitality industry which drives the economy in the state of Louisiana Many were worried that the police would not have time to enforce the ban So the health department will handle bar warnings and nes Bar customers are encouraged to ll out a form or call 311 and to include photographs of illegal smoking For this reason alone Neil Timms says hell comply with the ban I dont want someone to be sitting in the corner smoking and someone takes a photo and gets beaten up Unworried Geoff Douville says that hes used to noise complaints by now You will see the nosy neighbours who complain about the noise now

128,Noise from ships may disturb animals such as killer whales and dolphins much more than we thought before New research shows that underwater noise could stop these animals communicating and make it more dif cult for them to nd food It is well known that noise from ships disturbs large whales But US researchers have found noise also disturbs smaller sea creatures such as killer whales also known as orcas Dolphins and porpoises may have the same problems The main problem is that even a small increase in sound may make it more dif cult for whales to nd food using echo said Scott Veirs who led the research Thats worrying because their food a kind of salmon is already quite scarce Hearing a salmons click is probably one of the most dif cult things a killer whale does It is harder to hear that click if theres a lot of noise around you The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise made by about 1600 ships as they passed through Haro Strait in Washington State USA The twoyear study recorded the sound made by 12 different types of ship including cruise ships container ships and military ships that passed through the strait about 20 times a day Some ships are quieter than others but the average noise next to all the ships was 173 underwater decibels the same as 111 decibels through the air about the sound of a loud rock concert Whales are not usually right next to ships and so would hear noise of about 60 to 90 decibels around the level of a vacuum cleaner Veirs said scientists already knew about the effect of underwater noise on large whales But the new research shows the danger to smaller whales dolphins and porpoises We think that ships make lowfrequency noise like the sound of lorries or trains he said Most noise is at that low frequency but there is more background noise in the high frequencies too This might be causing a big problem that we need to study more Lots of underwater noise can cause many problems Whales may have to stay closer together to hear each other And if they cannot nd food easily they will need to use their extra blubber This is a problem because this blubber often contains manmade pollutants that are poisonous to whales if they get into their bodies Veirs said ships that pass near whales need to be quieter It should be easy to reduce noise pollution he said Military ships are much quieter and there could be simple ways of using that technology on normal ships Another way to reduce noise is to slow down Reducing speed by six knots could decrease noise by half Some whale species are safer now because there is less whaling but other types of whale are still in danger for many different reasons The US has recently protected nearly 40000 square miles of the Atlantic to save a species of whale with just 500 individuals left In Europe killer whales have dangerously high levels of illegal chemicals in their blubber Scientists are still trying to nd out if pollutants caused the deaths of ve whales that were found on beaches on the east coast of Britain in January 2016 And around the coast of Australia whales are in danger from oil and gas drilling as well as Japans recent decision to start whaling again in the seas of Antarctica,Noise from ships may disturb animals such as killer whales and dolphins much more than people previously thought New research shows that underwater noise could disturb the animals communication and ability to nd prey The low rumble of passing ships has for a long time been connected to the disturbance of large whales But US researchers have also found noise at medium and higher frequencies including at 20000Hz where killer whales also known as orcas hear best These noises could be disturbing the ability of killer whales to communicate and use echo to nd their prey Dolphins and porpoises which also hear at higher frequencies may have the same problems The ndings suggest that the noise could affect the endangered population of killer whales that are found near the shipping lanes up the west coast of the USA The main concern of this is that even a slight increase in sound may make echolocation more dif cult for whales said Scott Veirs who led the research Echolocation is the process of using sound to bounce off objects such as prey and identify where they are Thats worrying because their prey chinook salmon is already quite scarce Hearing a salmons click is probably one of the most challenging things a killer whale does Hearing that subtle click is harder if theres a lot of noise around you The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise created by about 1600 ships as they passed through Haro Strait in Washington State USA The twoyear study recorded the sound made by 12 different types of vessel including cruise ships container ships and military vehicles that passed through the strait about 20 times a day Some ships are quieter than others but the average intensity of noise next to all the ships was 173 underwater decibels equivalent to 111 decibels through the air about the sound of a loud rock concert Whales are not usually right next to ships and so would hear noise of about 60 to 90 decibels around the level of a lawnmower or a vacuum cleaner Veirs said scientists already knew about the impact of underwater noise on large whales But the new research shows the threat to smaller whales dolphins and porpoises Ships have been thought of as lowfrequency sources of noise like the rumbling of lorries or trains he said Most noise is at that low frequency but the background noise of the ocean is raised even in the high frequencies This could be causing a signi cant problem that we need to look into more There are several further consequences of a noisy underwater environment Whales may have to group together more closely in order to hear each other And if they fail to nd prey as effectively they will need to use up their stores of extra blubber This is a problem because this blubber often contains manmade pollutants that are toxic to whales if they are released fully into their systems Veirs said more work needs to be done to identify how badly the noise is affecting whales and also to quieten the ships that pass near them It should be easy to reduce noise pollution he said Military ships are quite a bit quieter and there could be simple ways of transferring that technology to commercial ships Another way to reduce noise is to slow down Decreasing speed by six knots could decrease noise by half While some whale species such as blue whales the largest mammal on Earth are safer now because whaling has declined others are still under threat from a range of factors The US federal government has recently protected nearly 40000 square miles of the Atlantic to try to avoid losing a species of whale with just 500 individuals left In Europe killer whales are carrying dangerously high levels of banned chemicals in their blubber Scientists are still trying to nd out whether pollutants caused the deaths of ve whales that were found on beaches on the east coast of Britain in January 2016 Meanwhile around the coast of Australia whales face an increased threat from ship strikes and oil and gas drilling as well as Japans recent decision to start whaling again in Antarctic waters,validation,ELE,INT
11,A menu scandal at some of Japans top hotels and department stores is damaging the international reputation of Japanese food One luxury hotel group admitted that it lied about ingredients on its menus Since then there have been similar stories from restaurants run by famous hotels and department stores in Japan The story began when the HankyuHanshin hotel group admitted that it gave false descriptions of menu items at some of its restaurants between 2006 and October 2013 For example the red salmon caviar that customers ordered was in fact the eggs of the flying fish The hotel groups president Hiroshi Desaki went on television to announce a 20 pay cut for himself and 10 for other executives But this did not make customers less angry Days later Desaki resigned he said that the hotel group had betrayed their customers So far the company has refunded 20 million yen to more than 10000 consumers In total they will refund 110 million yen Customers who believed they ate expensive kuruma shrimps were told they in fact ate much cheaper black tiger shrimps complained in a blogpost that a scallop dish he ordered at the Prince Hotel in Tokyo contained a similar but cheaper type of shellfish The hotel investigated the complaint and as a result corrected more than 50 menu items at dozens of its restaurants Its report scared HankyuHanshin and other hoteliers into admitting that they too lied to customers who believed they were paying high prices for top ingredients The Hotel Okura group where Barack Obama has stayed said they also injected beef with fat to make it juicier and incorrectly described tomatoes as organic We apologize for lying to our clients it said The list of fraudulent ingredients gets bigger orange juice from cartons that was sold as freshly squeezed Mont Blanc desserts with Korean chestnuts instead of the French ones on the menu shopbought chocolate cream that the menu said was homemade imported beef sold as expensive wagyu beef The menu scandal has come at the wrong time Japan is trying to persuade South Korea and other countries to start to buy Japanese food again after the Fukushima nuclear accident Food industry experts said the global financial crisis in 2008 forced luxury hotels to save money Menu descriptions were created to sound good to the customers and when hotels couldnt get the ingredients on the menu they just used food from different places Hiroshi Tomozawa a hotel and restaurant consultant told Kyodo News,It began with a bogus scallop but a menu scandal that has affected some of Japans top hotels and department stores now threatens the international reputation of the countrys food Since one luxury hotel chain admitted lying about ingredients on its menus Japanese media have written stories of similar incidents in restaurants run by wellknown hotels and department stores The story began when the HankyuHanshin hotel chain based in Osaka admitted it had given false descriptions of dozens of menu items at some of its restaurants between 2006 and October 2013 which affected an estimated 78000 diners One of the worst menu misdemeanours was a red salmon caviar dish that was actually the less luxurious eggs of the flying fish The hotel groups president Hiroshi Desaki went on television to announce a 20 pay cut for himself and 10 for other executives but this did not make consumers any less angry Days later Desaki resigned saying that the hotel group had betrayed our customers One of the hotels head chefs later declined a medal of honour he was going to receive from the government The company has so far refunded 20 million yen to more than 10000 consumers The final bill is expected to reach 110 million yen Consumers who believed they had eaten expensive kuruma shrimps were told they had in fact eaten the much cheaper black tiger version The scandal started when a diner complained in a blogpost that a scallop dish he had ordered at the Prince Hotel in Tokyo contained a similar but cheaper type of shellfish The hotel started an investigation and as a result corrected more than 50 menu items at dozens of its restaurants Its report scared HankyuHanshin and other hoteliers into admitting that they too had hoodwinked diners who believed they were paying high prices for top ingredients The Hotel Okura chain whose guests have included Barack Obama said they had also injected beef with fat to make it juicier and incorrectly described tomatoes as organic We deeply apologize for betraying the expectations and confidence of our clients it said in a statement The list of fraudulent ingredients continues to grow orange juice from cartons sold as freshly squeezed Mont Blanc desserts topped with Korean chestnuts instead of the promised French ones shopbought chocolate cream that the menu said was homemade imported beef sold as expensive wagyu Even the governments top spokesman Yoshihide Suga commented on the scandal This inappropriate labelling has resulted in the loss of trust among consumers he told reporters The fraudulent menu scandal has exploded at just the wrong time Japan is trying to persuade South Korea and other countries to lift a ban on food imports that began after the Fukushima nuclear accident And UNESCO is considering a request to add Japanese cuisine to its cultural heritage list One local newspaper had the headline Japans proud food culture in tears while the newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun said it was shocked by the industrys lack of morals Industry experts said the global financial crisis in 2008 had forced luxury hotels to cut costs while attempting to woo diners with detailed menu descriptions Menu descriptions were created to meet consumers preferences and when they couldnt get the ingredients on the menu hotels just used food from different places Hiroshi Tomozawa a hotel and restaurant consultant told Kyodo News The industrys biggest problem will come from Japans demanding consumers In 2009 72 of diners in Japan said that when they were choosing from a menu where the food is from was the most important thing for them followed by the amount of calories and other nutritional

28,In summer in the Arctic regions of Canada the sun shines for more than 20 hours a day Some people enjoy this after the constant darkness of winter But for the small Muslim community of Iqaluit life in the land of the midnight sun is a real challenge during the month of Ramadan when Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset I havent fainted once said 29yearold Abdul Karim one of only a few Muslims in the area who has carefully timed his Ramadan fast to the Arctic sun This year that means he eats at about 130am before the sun rises and breaks his fast at about 11pm when the sun sets I would only stop if it hurt my health Karim said Most Muslims in Iqaluit follow the timetable that Muslims in Ottawa about 1300 miles south follow This follows the advice of Muslim scholars who have said Muslims in the far north should observe Ramadan using the timetable of Mecca or the nearest Muslim city They still have to fast for around 18 hours a day said Atif Jilani who moved to Iqaluit from Toronto The days are long but we can do it Its a similar situation in all of Canadas most northern mosques during Ramadan where Muslims have to live with very long or very short days In recent years much of the community has chosen to follow the Ramadan timetable of Edmonton in Alberta Some follow the timetable of Mecca for example Awan a father of two young children including a 12yearold who recently started fasting He hopes that the easier timetable will encourage his son it means about 15 hours of fasting not 18 hours like in Edmonton If I fast Edmonton times my son might say Papa you are really insane What are you doing he said For the 100 Muslims in Inuvik a small town 125 miles north of the Arctic Circle it is impossible to follow the local movements of the sun They also follow Edmontons timetable We currently have 24 hours a day of sun said Ahmad Alkhalaf Theres no sunrise or sunset People already followed the Edmonton timetable in 2001 when he moved from Toronto to the small northern town of 3500 people My first Ramadan here was in December Theres no sun at that time its dark all day and night So we used Edmonton time Sometimes it can be difficult to follow the clock and not the sun Alkhalaf said We should break our fast when its dusk but we eat when the sun is up Its not usual to have iftar the meal that breaks the fast when the sun is up he said In Inuvik where most of the population is Inuit the Muslim community has tried to find a balance between Ramadan and the local culture and traditions The iftar meal includes curries and also local meat such as reindeer We make a soup or curry but we dont use beef we use reindeer In Iqaluit this Ramadan has been one of the most difficult of recent years because it includes some of the longest days of the year Its particularly true for people like Karim who have followed the local sunrise and sunset carefully But it will be easier for him to fast in future years he says thanks to the lunar calendar Ramadan will then fall during winter and in Iqaluit the sun will rise and set within a few hours each day Ill follow those hours too he said with a laugh Oh yes,In the Arctic regions of Canada the summer sun shines for more than 20 hours a day For some its a welcome change from the constant darkness of winter But for the small but growing Muslim community of Iqaluit Nunavut life in the land of the midnight sun is a real challenge during the month of Ramadan when Muslims typically fast from sunrise to sunset I havent fainted once said 29yearold Abdul Karim one of the few in the area who has carefully timed his Ramadan fast to the Arctic sun since moving from Ottawa in 2011 This year that means eating at about 130am before the sun rises and breaking his fast at about 11pm when the sun sets The only reason to stop would be if it hurts my health Karim said It is nearly the end of Ramadan for Muslims around the world Fasting is important but during the holy month in every Muslim community there is also a focus on community work prayer and reflection But in Iqaluit and the other Muslim communities in the Arctic the long days have forced a change in how they fast Most Muslims in Iqaluit follow the timetable followed by Muslims in Ottawa about 1300 miles south this follows the advice of Muslim scholars who have said Muslims in the far north should observe Ramadan using the timetable of Mecca or the nearest Muslim city It still means fasting for around 18 hours a day said Atif Jilani who moved to Iqaluit from Toronto The days are long but its more manageable Many in the community of 100 people break their fast together they gather in the citys brand new mosque for nightly suppers As they tuck into traditional food such as dates and goat or lamb curries the sun shines brightly through the windows Its a similar situation across Canadas most northern mosques during Ramadan as Muslims deal with the countrys unique geography In recent years much of the community has chosen to follow the Ramadan timetable of Edmonton in Alberta Some follow the timings of Mecca for example Awan a father of two young children including a 12yearold who recently started fasting He hopes to encourage his son with the more manageable timetable of about 15 hours of fasting compared with about 18 hours in Edmonton If I fast Edmonton times my son might say Papa you are really insane What are you doing he said For the 100 or so Muslims in Inuvik a small town 125 miles north of the Arctic Circle it is impossible to follow the local movements of the sun They have also been following Edmontons timetable We currently have 24 hours a day of sun said Ahmad Alkhalaf Theres no sunrise or sunset They were already following the Edmonton schedule in 2001 when he moved from Toronto to the small northern community of 3500 people My first Ramadan here was in December Theres no sun at that time its dark all day and night So we used Edmonton time At times it can be difficult to follow the clock rather than what is happening outside Alkhalaf said Youre supposed to break your fast when its dusk but we eat when the sun is up Its not usual to have iftar the meal that breaks the fast when the sun is up he said In Inuvik where most of the population is Inuit the Muslim community has tried to strike a balance between Ramadan and the local culture and traditions The iftar meal includes dates and curries as well as local game such as reindeer We make a soup or curry but instead of using beef we use reindeer In Iqaluit as the Muslim community prepares to mark the end of Ramadan some reflect that 2016s timing stretching across some of the longest days of the year has made it one of the more difficult of recent years Its particularly true for those like Karim who have followed the local sunrise and sunset carefully But his efforts will be rewarded in future years said Karim thanks to the lunar calendar Ramadan will eventually fall during winter and in Iqaluit the sun will rise and set within a few hours each day Ill follow those hours too he said with a laugh Oh yes definitely,validation,ELE,INT
143,You probably know a vaper someone who smokes ecigarettes But has vaping started to become less popular Statistics suggest that smokers and recent exsmokers the majority of vapers may already be using ecigarettes less The big ecigarette companies will study the figures carefully because they have spent millions of pounds on a technology that they thought was becoming more popular Ecigarettes do not contain tobacco and produce vapour not smoke In 2014 the health charity Action on Smoking and Health published figures that showed that the number of British users of electronic cigarettes has increased three times from 700000 users in 2012 to 21 million in 2014 But figures from the Smoking Toolkit Study show vaping may be becoming less popular The number of vapers who are smokers and ex smokers rose until the end of 2013 when 22 of smokers and exsmokers were vaping But this percentage stopped rising in 2014 Then it dropped to 19 at the end of the year Professor Robert West who collected the data for the Toolkit described the figures as statistically important Smokers are the key group for ecigarette companies because seven out of ten vapers are smokers Only around 1 of people who have never smoked have tried an electronic cigarette The number of people who use ecigarettes while continuing to smoke is going down West said Weve only been studying vaping for just over a year so its a short time period but we are not seeing growth in the number of longterm exsmokers or never smokers using ecigarettes The number of people vaping might change but at the moment it looks like its staying the same Experts believe that vaping will probably not become fashionable with young nonsmokers Only 18 of children are regular ecigarette users But ecigarettes seem to be most popular with adults who want to quit The figures published this month show that the use of electronic cigarettes by smokers has stopped rising But the figures also show the huge increase in use since May 2011 said James Dunworth of ecigarettedirectcouk Our customers are still very happy with the product and technology is improving their experience and helping them to switch from traditional cigarettes Ecigarettes are like a sort of nicotine patch West agreed They are more popular than nicotine patches but we do not know if they are more effective Onethird of people who want to quit smoking use ecigarettes They are the most popular method of stopping The European Commission EC wants to increase taxes on ecigarettes which could make them less popular A new EC tobacco directive becomes law in 2016 It will limit the amount of nicotine in ecigarettes to below their current levels This may mean vapers will have to increase the number they smoke to get the same effect This is another thing that may make ecigarettes more expensive West suggested that politicians should see ecigarettes as something that helps people stop smoking He doesnt think they should follow the same laws as smoking Some local authorities and organizations treat ecigarettes like cigarettes they ban them in public places and outdoors he said He thinks we should support vapers not attack them,We often see our colleagues and friends smoking an ecigarette But has vaping started to become less popular Statistics suggest that vaping among smokers and recent exsmokers who are the vast majority of vapers may already be declining The gures will be studied closely by the major ecigarette companies which have put millions of pounds into a technology that they thought was growing in popularity Figures released in 2014 by the health charity Action on Smoking and Health ASH reveal that usage among adults in Britain of electronic cigarettes which do not contain tobacco and produce vapour not smoke has tripled from 700000 users in 2012 to 21 million in 2014 However gures collated by the Smoking Toolkit Study a research organization that provides quarterly updates on smoking trends show vapings appeal may be declining Vaping rates among smokers and exsmokers rose steadily until the end of 2013 when 22 of smokers and exsmokers were vaping But this proportion stopped rising in 2014 before dropping to 19 during the nal quarter of the year The drop is described as statistically signi cant by Professor Robert West who collates the gures for the Toolkit Smokers are the key group for ecigarette companies because seven out of ten vapers are smokers Only around 1 of people who have never smoked have tried an electronic cigarette Numbers who use ecigarettes while continuing to smoke are going down West said Weve only been studying vaping for just over a year so its a short time period but we are not seeing growth in the number of longterm exsmokers or never smokers using ecigarettes Vaping rates might change but at this stage it looks like theyre staying the same The fact that vaping has stopped growing in popularity in the UK seems to be at odds with what is happening in the US where the technology has been promoted aggressively and where reports suggest it is growing in popularity However West questioned the interpretation of US data which made little distinction between people who had once tried an ecigarette and those who regularly vaped Experts believe it is unlikely that vaping will become fashionable among young nonsmokers Only 18 of children are regular users the ASH study found Instead ecigarettes seem to be most popular among adults who want to quit While the gures published this month by Smoking In England show that the use of electronic cigarettes by smokers has stopped rising their data also shows the huge increase in use since May 2011 said James Dunworth of ecigarettedirectcouk Our customers are still very happy with the product and technology and innovation in hardware is improving user experience and helping them to switch from traditional cigarettes Ecigarettes behave like a sort of nicotine patch West agreed They are more popular than nicotine patches and may or may not be more effective Onethird of quit attempts use ecigarettes which makes them by far the most popular method of stopping Hazel Cheeseman director of policy at ASH said it was too soon to say whether vaping had peaked Although there are indications that the market hasnt grown in the UK for about a year there doesnt seem to be a decline in the number of people using electronic cigarettes to help them quit smoking The European Commission EC is looking at increasing taxes on ecigarettes which could have an impact on their popularity A new EC tobacco directive comes into force in 2016 that will limit the amount of nicotine in ecigarettes to below their current levels This may mean vapers will have to increase their usage to get the same effect again something that may make ecigarettes more expensive West suggested that policymakers should see ecigarettes as an aid to stopping smoking and not have the same regulations for them as for smoking There is a tendency among some local authorities and organizations to treat ecigarettes as cigarettes and ban them in public places and outdoors he said It just sounds like youre having a go at vapers and that undermines the public health messages were trying to get out We have to be careful not to stigmatize ecigarettes,validation,ELE,INT
