18,Joseph Roche is on the shortlist of astronauts for Mars One a private mission that plans to send humans to live on Mars from 2025 He is on the shortlist but he is sceptical about Mars One Roche is an astrophysicist at Trinity College Dublin He is one of the 100 people on the shortlist for the mission He has doubts about Mars One The selection process Roche says did not reach the standard of more traditional astronaut selection processes He also says the Dutch Mars One team are naive because they believe they can succeed alone in the 6 billion mission He says they should now accept it will probably not happen The group plans to send a lander and satellite to Mars in 2018 followed by a rover in 2020 and cargo missions starting in 2022 Humans will start arriving in 2025 and they will send more crews of four people every two years The astronauts will not return to Earth Gerard t Hooft is a Dutch Nobel laureate in physics He is a supporter of the project but he says he does not believe the Mars One plans are realistic He said It will take longer and be more expensive When they asked me to be involved I told them You have to put a zero after everything Roche also said that there were not 200000 people who applied to be astronauts as Mars One said there were only 2761 He talked about the selection process in more detail I have not met anyone from Mars One At first they said there would be regional interviews we would travel there and they would interview and test us over several days To me that sounded like a proper astronaut selection process But it changed from a proper regional interview over several days to a tenminute Skype call Roche says he does not want to give more interviews because he doesnt want to sound negative about space travel He said that being involved in the public debate about future missions is one of the most interesting and enjoyable things about his connection with Mars One He then said that If a oneway mission to Mars ever became possible I would always volunteer For an astrophysicist that is not a difficult decision to make But he does not think there will be a oneway mission in his lifetime,He is not the first person to express scepticism about Mars One a private mission that aims to send humans to live on Mars from 2025 But Joseph Roche is different from most critics hes on the shortlist of astronauts Roche an astrophysicist at Trinity College Dublin who was announced in February as one of the 100 people shortlisted for the mission has written for the Guardian expressing his doubts about the viability of Mars One The selection process Roche writes was not rigorous enough to reach the standard of more traditional astronaut selection programmes He also says the Dutch Mars One team have shown a certain naivety because they believe they can succeed alone in the 6bn mission He says they should now accept it is very unlikely to happen Roche also expressed worries about the way the mission organizers publicized a topten list of candidates The ranking he said didnt mean these were the best astronauts It was based on how many supporter points each had earned He says that these points only show how much each supporter has donated to Mars One for example by buying official merchandise The official timeline for the mission says the group plans to send a stationary lander and satellite to Mars in 2018 followed by a rover in 2020 and cargo missions starting in 2022 Humans would start arriving in 2025 and crews of four would be sent every two years to add to the settlement They would not return to Earth In February a supporter of the project Gerard t Hooft a Dutch Nobel laureate in physics said he did not believe this timetable was realistic He said It will take quite a bit longer and be quite a bit more expensive When they first asked me to be involved I told them You have to put a zero after everything Roche also said that there were not 200000 people who applied to be astronauts as Mars One said there were only 2761 He talked about the selection process in more detail I have not met anyone from Mars One in person Initially there were going to be regional interviews we would travel there wed be interviewed and wed be tested over several days In my mind that sounded like a proper astronaut selection process But all of a sudden it changed from being a proper regional interview over several days to being a tenminute Skype call Roche told the Guardian that he did not want to give more interviews because he didnt want to sound negative about the idea of space travel He writes I am passionate about scientific endeavour and that is why the ambitiousness of the Mars One plan appealed to me Mars One were never likely to overcome the financial and technical barriers during their proposed timeline But it was nice to hear a new idea that challenges us to think about our own role in the future of space exploration He said that being part of the public debate about future missions has been one of the most interesting and enjoyable aspects of his involvement with Mars One He went on to say that If a oneway mission to Mars ever became possible I would always volunteer For an astrophysicist that is not a difficult decision to make But he does not think there will be a oneway mission in his lifetime,validation,ELE,INT
105,He was a normal millionaire He had a gold and silver Rolex watch and lots of expensive cars He liked to buy modern art This Chinese businessman had many companies and a large villa in Madrid But he had almost no money in the bank This interested the Spanish authorities Gao Ping sold goods to 4000 Chinese markets in Spain But authorities suspected he was not paying taxes on the clothes furniture and other goods he was bringing in from China When police went to his warehouses in 2012 they found lots of cash 100 200 and 500 notes Police took away around 12m the most cash ever found by Spanish police Police have been worried about 500 notes for a long time Small and easy to transport they are the favourite banknotes of criminals The sum of 1m in 500 notes fits easily into a small laptop bag The same amount in 50 notes would need a small suitcase The UK stopped using the 500 note in 2010 because they were used almost entirely by criminals In 2009 Italys central bank said that mafia money launderers and terrorists used the notes Canada got rid of its 1000 note in 2000 because the police advised them to These days we have electronic payment systems and contactless cards so people are asking why it is still necessary to have these banknotes Peter Sands the former head of Standard Chartered Bank said we should get rid of large notes including the 500 the 100 the 1000 Swiss Franc note and the 50 Sands said it was time to get rid of highvalue notes that make life easier for bad guys Criminals would instead use smaller banknotes or gold or diamonds but these are big so criminals cannot carry them easily he said The purple 500 note was introduced in 2002 it replaced the 1000 Deutschmark the 10000 Belgian franc and the 500000 Italian lira In Germany and Austria people still pay with paper money and coins more than half the time Europol would like central banks to take more responsibility for what happens with 500 notes EU finance ministers have asked banks and authorities to look at whether countries should limit highvalue notes or get rid of them,He had the tastes of a typical millionaire He owned a gold and silver Rolex and lots of expensive cars He liked to buy modern art But although this Chinese businessman had several companies and a large villa in Madrid he had almost no money in the bank This detail interested the Spanish authorities Gao Ping supplied 4000 Chinese bazaars across Spain But authorities suspected he was not paying taxes on the clothes furniture and other goods he was importing from China When police searched his warehouses in 2012 they found piles of cash 100 200 and 500 notes were wrapped in elastic bands Around 12m was taken away the largest amount of cash ever found by Spanish police Gaos gang is accused of laundering up to 300m a year as well as selling counterfeit goods and toys with fake safety marks Law enforcement officials have been worried about 500 notes for a long time Small and easy to transport relative to their value they are the payment method that tax dodgers money launderers and drug barons prefer to use The sum of 1m in 500 notes fits easily into a small laptop bag The same amount in 50 notes would need a small suitcase The UK stopped distribution of the 500 note in 2010 because it was used almost entirely by criminals In 2009 Italys central bank warned that the notes were widely used by mafia money launderers and terrorists Other countries have limited their own highdenomination notes due to links to organized crime Canada got rid of its 1000 note in 2000 on the advice of law enforcement officers Now with electronic payment systems and contactless cards people are asking whether we should print these notes Peter Sands the former head of Standard Chartered Bank said we should get rid of highdenomination notes including the 500 the 100 the 1000 Swiss Franc note and the 50 In a report for the Harvard Kennedy School of Government Sands said it was time to get rid of highvalue notes that make life easier for bad guys Criminals would instead use smallerdenomination bills or gold or diamonds but these are too big to be carried easily and more traceable This makes it more likely they will get caught he said At a conference on terrorist financing in London the Head of Europol Rob Wainwright asked the European Central Bank to look at whether it should continue to produce these notes that make it easier for criminals and terrorists to hide their business and to provide money for illegal activities According to Europol the purple 500 note makes up 30 of the value of all the euro notes although most people have never seen one The 500 note was introduced in 2002 when the euro was born it replaced the 1000 Deutschmark the 10000 Belgian franc and the 500000 Italian lira In Germany and Austria more than half of all transactions are still made with paper money and coins Europol would like to see central banks take more responsibility for what happens with 500 notes Luxembourg for example issued more than twice its annual GDP in banknotes in 2013 alone Europol asked Luxembourgs central bank to explain The reply from Luxembourg was that they simply issue the notes that are asked for and do not ask or know why people want them said Jennifer MacLeod a specialist in Europols financial intelligence group I find it surprising that a central bank does not consider itself to have a responsibility in this area This could be changing EU finance ministers have asked policymakers to think about appropriate limits on highvalue notes and report back by 1 May 2016,validation,ELE,INT
3,Anitta a music star from Brazil has millions of fans but she is at the centre of a debate about skin colour Some people are saying that Anitta had to give up her black skin to be a success in the mostly white middleclass market The debate was started by photographs that show that Anittas skin has got much lighter since she signed a music deal with Warner In the first photo before she was famous she looked darker In the second photo a marketing photo after she became famous she seems lighter The difference has started a discussion about whether you need to have light skin to be a success in Brazil Born Larissa de Macedo Machado the divatobe was a church chorister in her childhood In her teens she made a name for herself in Rio de Janeiros baile funk scene as a dancer and singer She now has an album and a huge hit single Show das Poderosas which was number one in the charts and attracted 52 million YouTube views Many people love her because she is a pop idol with a strong message and some good pop songs Her marketing team want people to see her as a cultural bridge between the poor people living in the mostly black and mixedrace shanty towns on Rios hills and the richer and whiter parts below But now people are asking if she or her marketing team have gone too far and changed her too much This is a sensitive topic in this mixedraced country Brazil has the largest population of African descent outside Africa but race and where your family come from are less important there than colour There is a clear link between skin colour and inequality In Brazilian cities white workers earn twice as much as workers of African descent Up until 2011 black or mixedrace students also spent two years less at school on average Most business and government executives are white but black and mixedrace workers do most of the boring or dirty jobs Brazil did a census in 2010 Among the 197 million population 82 million said they were pardu mixed race 15 million black two million Asian and 05 indigenous Maycon de Mattos Batista a financial analyst who used to work with Anitta said there has been a huge change in Anittas image but not of her colour I dont believe she is whiter its more the makeup hairstylists and the way she dresses he said I dont think that was because of pressure they put on her She always liked to show off sing and dance That was a natural thing for her I believe that it is because of this naturalness that she has become a success,Brazils latest funk sensation Anitta has won millions of fans by making the favela sound popular but she is at the centre of a debate about skin colour Antidiscrimination campaigners and social commentators say the music industrys fastest rising star has had to give up her blackness to be a success in the predominantly white middleclass market The controversy began with the publication of thenandnow photographs that show a dramatic lightening of Anittas skin tone since she signed a deal with Warner In the first photo when she was quite unknown she looked darker In the second a marketing photo after she became famous she seems lighter The contrast has restarted discussion about whether you need to have light skin to get ahead in Brazil Jarid Arraes a psychology student and blogger wrote a post criticizing the discrimination in media and marketing that she felt Anittas image change represented People refuse to accept that they are racist and they think they live in a multiracial democracy but the statistics show that is far from the case White is the image of the rich the nice the successful the good while people see black as the opposite of all that Born Larissa de Macedo Machado the divatobe was a church chorister in her childhood In her teens she made a name for herself in Rio de Janeiros baile funk scene as a dancer and singer She now has an album and a huge hit single Show das Poderosas which topped the charts and attracted 52 million YouTube views Many people love her because she is a pop idol with a strong message and some catchy tunes Her marketing team want people to see her as a cultural bridge between the predominantly black and mixedrace shanty towns on Rios hillsides and the wealthier and whiter communities below gangsta references and explicit lyrics of baile funk Now however questions are being asked about whether she or her marketing team have gone too far in changing her Arraes says that if pop stars have curly hair they will want to straighten it If they have a big nose they will want to make it smaller It creates a vicious cycle for how you feel about yourself This is a sensitive topic in this largely mixedraced nation Brazil one of the last big countries in the world to ban slavery has the largest population of African descent outside Africa but race and where your family come from are less important there than colour There is a clear link between skin tone and inequality In Brazilian cities white workers earn roughly twice as much as those of African descent Up until 2011 black or mixedrace students also spent two years less at school on average Most business and government executives are white while most menial jobs are done by black and mixedrace workers If you walk through Ipanema Gvea or other rich districts you are far more likely to see black nannies pushing strollers with white children than a white nanny pushing a black child Defining colour is complex People who define themselves as white were in the minority for the first time in the most recent census in 2010 Among the 197 million population 82 million said they were pardu mixed race 15 million black two million Asian and 05 indigenous Sylvio Ferreira a psychology lecturer at the Federal University of Pernambuco believes Anitta has won the hearts of the middle class by taking a rebellious sound and making it more acceptable to everyone Maycon de Mattos Batista a financial analyst who worked with Anitta while she was an intern said there had been a huge change in Anittas image but not of her colour I dont believe its whitening its more the way they are producing her with makeup hairstylists and the way she dresses he said I dont think that was because of pressure they put on her She always liked to show off sing and dance That was a natural thing for her I believe that it is because of this naturalness that she is where she is

4,An octopus has escaped from the National Aquarium in New Zealand It escaped from its tank slid down a 50metre drainpipe and disappeared into the sea Inky a common New Zealand octopus escaped after someone left the lid of his tank open Staff at the aquarium believe that in the middle of the night when there was noone in the building Inky climbed down the side of the tank and travelled across the floor Rob Yarrell national manager of the National Aquarium of New Zealand in Napier said Octopuses are famous for their ability to escape I dont think he was unhappy with us or lonely because octopuses like to live alone But he is such a curious boy He would want to know whats happening on the outside Thats his personality One idea is that Inky crossed the aquarium floor a journey of three or four metres and then he realized that freedom was very near so he entered a drainpipe that led directly to the sea The drainpipe was 50 metres long and opened into Hawkes Bay on the east coast of New Zealands North Island It is also possible that Inky escaped through an open pipe at the top of his tank which led under the floor to the drain When we came in the next morning and his tank was empty I was really surprised said Yarrell who has not started looking for Inky The staff and I have been sad But then this is Inky and hes always been a bit of a surprise octopus Reiss Jenkinson a keeper at the National Aquarium said he was absolutely certain Inky was not stolen I understand octopus behaviour very well he said I have seen octopuses on boats escape through waste pumps And the security here is too good for anyone to take Inky and why would they Because octopuses have no bones they can fit into very small spaces and can squeeze through gaps the size of coins They are also very intelligent and able to use tools At the Island Bay Marine Education Centre in Wellington an octopus visited another tank every night to steal crabs then return to its own tank Another octopus at the centre Ozymandias broke a world record for opening a jar Inky was brought to the National Aquarium several years ago by a local fisherman who found him in a fishing pot Yarrell said He lived on the reef and fought with fish so he was quite ill According to Yarrell Inky who is about the size of a rugby ball was an unusually intelligent octopus He was very friendly and a popular attraction here We have another octopus Blotchy but he is smaller than Inky and Inky had the personality The aquarium has no plans to increase security as a result of the escape but the staff now know what octopuses can do so they will be more careful The aquarium is not looking for another octopus but if a fisherman brought in another octopus the aquarium might take it You never know said Yarrell

another octopus Blotchy but he is smaller than Inky and Inky had the personality The aquarium has no plans to step up security as a result of the escape because they dont think it will happen again

150,According to a recent scienti c study organic food has more healthy antioxidants than regular food It also has fewer toxic metals and pesticides The international team that did the study suggests that changing to organic fruit and vegetables could be as healthy as adding one or two portions of the recommended ve a day fruit and vegetables The team led by Professor Carlo Leifert concludes that there are big differences between organic and nonorganic food Organic food has between 19 and 69 more antioxidants It is the rst study to show clear differences between organic and regular fruits vegetables and cereals The researchers say that the higher levels of antioxidants have the same effect as one to two of the ve portions of fruits and vegetables that people should eat every day They say this means that organic food is better for our health The ndings will make people argue even more about whether or not organic food is better for people Tom Sanders a professor of nutrition at Kings College London said the research showed some differences But are the differences relevant I am not sure He also said that research showed organic cereals have less protein than regular crops The results of the research are based on an analysis of 343 studies from around the world more than ever before which examine differences between organic and regular fruit vegetables and cereals Helen Browning who supports organic farming said that the research showed that how we farm affects the quality of the food we eat Leifert and his colleagues conclude that many antioxidants reduce the risk of serious diseases including diseases of the heart and certain cancers The researchers also found much higher levels of cadmium a toxic metal in regular crops They found four times more pesticides on regular crops than on organic food People will criticize the research including so many studies in the analysis could make the results unreliable Also the higher levels of cadmium and pesticides in regular food are still below recommended limits But the researchers say that cadmium stays in the body and that some people may want to avoid this They also say that recommended limits are for single pesticides and not for the mixture of chemicals that farmers use on regular crops Another criticism of the research is that the differences it found may be the result of different climates different types of soil and different types of crops they may not be the result of organic farming But the biggest criticism will be about possible health bene ts The most recent major analysis which included 223 studies in 2012 found little evidence of health bene ts Other studies did not nd evidence that organic foods are much more nutritious than regular foods it found Sanders agrees You are not going to be healthier if you eat organic food he said What is most important is what you eat not whether its organic or regular Its whether you eat fruit and vegetables at all Shoppers say that healthy eating 55 and avoiding chemicals 53 are the main reasons they buy organic food Browning said This research supports what people think about organic food In other countries there is much more support and acceptance of the bene ts of organic food and farming We hope that now the UK will accept organic food like people in the rest of Europe,Organic food has more of the antioxidants linked to better health than regular food and lower levels of toxic metals and pesticides according to the most comprehensive scienti c analysis so far The international team behind the work suggests that switching to organic fruit and vegetables could give the same bene ts as adding one or two portions of the recommended ve a day fruit and vegetables The team led by Professor Carlo Leifert concludes that there are statistically signi cant differences with a range of antioxidants being substantially higher between 19 and 69 in organic food It is the rst study to demonstrate clear differences between organic and conventional fruits vegetables and cereals The researchers say the increased levels of antioxidants are equivalent to one to two of the ve portions of fruits and vegetables recommended to be consumed daily and would therefore be signi cant in terms of human nutrition The ndings will add to the controversy over organic food and whether it is better for people Tom Sanders a professor of nutrition at Kings College London said the research did show some differences But the question is are they within natural variation And are they nutritionally relevant I am not convinced He added Leifert has had a lot of disagreements with a lot of people He also said that research showed organic cereals have less protein than conventional crops The results of the research are based on an analysis of 343 studies from around the world more than ever before which examine differences between organic and conventional fruit vegetables and cereals The important thing about this research is that it shatters the myth that how we farm does not affect the quality of the food we eat said Helen Browning chief executive of the Soil Association which campaigns for organic farming Leifert and his colleagues conclude that many antioxidants have previously been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases including cardiovascular diseases neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers The researchers also found much higher levels of cadmium a toxic metal in conventional crops Pesticide residues were found on conventional crops four times more often than on organic food The research is certain to be criticized the inclusion of so many studies in the analysis could mean poorquality work makes the results unreliable Also the higher levels of cadmium and pesticides in conventional produce were still far below recommended limits But the researchers say cadmium accumulates over time in the body and that some people may wish to avoid this and that pesticide limits are set individually not for the cocktail of chemicals used on crops A further criticism of the research is that the differences seen may result from different climates soil types and crop varieties and not from organic farming The greatest criticism however will be over the suggestions of possible health bene ts The most recent major analysis which included 223 studies in 2012 found little evidence The published literature lacks strong evidence that organic foods are signi cantly more nutritious than conventional foods it found This was also the conclusion of earlier smaller studies published in 2009 in a scienti c journal and by the UK Food Standards Agency The 2012 study did note that eating organic food might help people avoid pesticide residues Sanders said he was not persuaded by the new work You are not going to be healthier if you eat organic food he said What is most important is what you eat not whether its organic or conventional Its whether you eat fruit and vegetables at all Opinion polls show healthy eating 55 and avoiding chemical residues 53 are key reasons given by shoppers for buying organic produce But many also say care for the environment 44 and animal welfare 31 are important and also taste 35 Browning said This research con rms what people think about organic food In other countries there have for a long time been much higher levels of support and acceptance of the bene ts of organic food and farming We hope these ndings will bring the UK into line with the rest of Europe,validation,ELE,INT

181,The business idea is to produce a cheap light that gets free power from gravity and could end the use of dangerous kerosene lamps in Africa and India But when British designer Patrick Hunt tried to get money from banks or venture capitalists to help start his business he hit a problem We tried to get funding but its slow and difficult and nobody wants to take a risk he said So he tried crowdfunding on a US website Indiegogo which has recently opened up in the UK Within five days he made 36200 His campaign was so popular that within 40 days he had made 400000 from the public A 10kg bag of rocks is attached to the light lifted to a height of about two metres and while it slowly falls to the ground it makes enough power for half an hour of light Hunt is one of a new group of entrepreneurs who are trying to get money from the fastgrowing crowdfunding industry to start their businesses Another new crowdfunding site is InvestingZone It matches wealthy people with entrepreneurs On Indiegogo users can offer perks for different levels of investment for example people who helped to fund Hunts light could feel good about helping someone who is less rich but they also got one of his lights as a present For Danae Ringelmann who started Indiegogo the gravity light is a perfect example of how crowdfunding can work and how it can test an entrepreneurs idea It is good to test ideas even if they dont get funding because that way you save a lot of time finding out it wasnt a good idea and you can get smarter faster she says Indiegogo started five years ago Now it is making about 2m a week for new businesses In December 2012 it started a European service It says it is very popular in Britain International activity has increased by 41 since December There are other crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter Seedrs and Funding Circle but Indiegogo is the only crowdfunding site where anyone can start a campaign No project is too crazy for Indiegogo The site charges a 4 fee for successful campaigns Entrepreneurs who do not find the amount of money they wanted to find can either pay back all the money or keep all the money but pay a 9 fee A British woman made 100000 to open a cat caf in London through the site It will be called Lady Dinahs Cat Emporium but it is not open yet It will be somewhere people can come in from the cold to a comfortable chair a hot cup of tea a book and a cat With her Wall Street background and the experience of helping 100000 businesses and services find money Ringelmann has good advice for entrepreneurs Ideas are a dime a dozen What is important is how you make your idea happen If you are afraid that someone will steal your idea and that that person will make your idea happen better and faster than you then you are not the right person to make the idea happen Its all about confidence to move fast and to learn she says Crowdfunding as an alternative to banks has grown but at the moment bigbucks investors with lots of money are not very interested That could start to change in the UK when people start using InvestingZone,The business idea is to produce a cheap light that gets free power from gravity and could end the use of dangerous kerosene lamps in Africa and India But when British designer Patrick Hunt tried to get money from banks or venture capitalists to launch his invention he hit a problem

driven by a 10kg bag of rocks The weight is attached to the light lifted to a height of about 2m and while it slowly falls to the ground it will generate enough power for half an hour of light Hunt is preparing for production in China and will test the market again by sending 1000 of the lights to Africa before the full mass production of millions of units He is one of a new wave of entrepreneurs who are turning to the fastgrowing crowdfunding industry for money Another new site is InvestingZone which matches wealthy people with startup entrepreneurs Indiegogo does not offer shares but allows users to offer perks for different levels of investment people who helped to fund Hunts light felt good about helping the less rich but also got their own light For Danae Ringelmann cofounder of Indiegogo the gravity light is a perfect example of how meritocratic crowdfunding can be and how it can test an entrepreneurs idea It is the first time that getting money has been fast efficient and meritocratic because it is not about How do I get access to the decision makers in that bank or Who do I know in that venture capital company This is all about proving your worth to your customers and fans getting them to agree your idea will work and fund it Even ideas that dont get funding are worth testing because you will have saved yourself a lot of time finding out it wasnt a good idea and getting smarter faster she says Ringelmann who is based in the US started her career as a Wall Street analyst In 2008 she decided to quit and use her skills to try and help friends who worked in the arts to raise money Five years on and the site is raising about 2m a week for new businesses in startup and growth stages In December 2012 it launched a euro and a sterling service to get a foothold on this side of the Atlantic and says Britain is its third biggest market International activity is up 41 since December There is no shortage of competitors be it Kickstarter Seedrs or Funding Circle but Indiegogo is the only crowdfunder where anyone can launch a campaign No project is thought too wacky The site charges a 4 fee for successful campaigns For those that fail to raise their target amount users can either refund all money to their contributors at no charge or keep all money raised but pay a 9 fee A British woman raised 100000 to open a cat caf in London through the site Called Lady Dinahs Cat Emporium it is not open yet but is advertised as somewhere people can come in from the cold to a comfortable chair a hot cup of tea a book and a cat Weve seen campaigns that go to venture capitalists get rejected because the venture capitalists say great idea but no idea if the market actually wants it it could be something that no one cares about said Ringelmann The entrepreneurs do an Indiegogo campaign and this can be enough market proof for venture capitalists to say there is a market for this It allows you to test your market test your pricing test your features discover new ways of getting money get vital feedback says Ringelmann With her Wall Street background and the experience of helping 100000 businesses and services raise money Ringelmann has useful advice for budding entrepreneurs Ideas are a dime a dozen Its all about the execution and if you are afraid that your idea will be stolen by someone who could execute it better and faster than you then you are not the right person to execute that idea Its all about confidence to move fast and to learn she says While crowdfunding as an alternative to banks has grown it is not very attractive to bigbucks investors who want a stake in a promising business That could start to change in the UK with the launch of InvestingZone,validation,ELE,INT
48,Scientists have designed a mirror that sends heat into cold space If you use the mirror you dont need to use airconditioning units that keep buildings cool on Earth The scientists believe that the mirror could reduce by a lot the amount of energy we use to control air temperatures in of ces and shopping centres Around 15 of the energy used by buildings in the US goes on air conditioning The researchers say that the mirror could mean that we no longer need air conditioning Scientists in Stanford California found that a roof painted black was 60C hotter than the air temperature in sunlight They found that aluminium was 40C hotter But the mirror was 5C cooler than the air temperature If you cover large parts of the roof with this mirror you can save a lot of power said Shanhui Fan an expert in the study of light at Stanford University He led the development of the mirror Buildings warm up in different ways Hotwater boilers and cooking areas release heat In hot countries warm air comes in through doors and windows Then there is visible light and infrared radiation from the sun which also heat up buildings The Stanford mirror re ects 97 of the visible light that falls on it But more importantly it releases heat When the mirror is warmed up it releases heat at a speci c wavelength of infrared light that goes easily through the atmosphere and out into space The mirror is made from several layers of very thin materials These layers help the mirror to release heat The mirror sends the heat as infrared light out to space The mirror can use the cold darkness of the universe even during the hottest hours of the day the scientists say Shanhui Fan says the mirrors costs between 20 and 70 per square metre He says that a mirror on a threestorey building could save 100MWh of electricity per year Fanalsosaidthatthemirrorcouldcoolbuildings but it would not slow down global warming But it would reduce the amount of electricity that businesses use Im really excited by this said Marin Soljai a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology You could use the mirrors on buildings and spend much less money on air conditioning or maybe you wouldnt need it at all You could put the mirrors on top of shopping malls,A mirror that sends heat into cold space has been designed by scientists to replace airconditioning units that keep buildings cool on Earth Researchers believe the mirror could slash the amount of energy used to control air temperatures in business premises and shopping centres because they wont need to use cooling systems Around 15 of the energy used by buildings in the USgoesonairconditioningbuttheresearchers say that in some cases the mirror could completely offset the need for extra cooling In a rooftop comparison in Stanford California scientists found that a roof that had been painted black reached 60C more than the air temperature in sunlight and aluminium reached 40C more However the mirror was up to 5C cooler than the surrounding air temperature If you cover signi cant parts of the roof with this mirror you can see how much power it can save You can signi cantly offset the electricity used for air conditioning said Shanhui Fan an expert in the study of light at Stanford University who led the development of the mirror In some situations you will be able to completely offset the air conditioning Buildings warm up in a number of different ways Hotwater boilers and cooking areas release heat into their immediate surroundings In hot countries warm air comes in through doors and windows Then there is visible light and infrared radiation from the sun which also heat up buildings The Stanford mirror was designed to re ect 97 of the visible light that falls on it But more importantly it works as a thermal radiator When the mirror is warmed up it releases heat at a speci c wavelength of infrared light that passes easily through the atmosphere and out into space To make anything cool you need what engineers call a heat sink somewhere to put unwanted heat The heat sink has to be cooler than the object that needs cooling or it will not do its job For example a bucket of ice will cool a bottle of wine because it becomes a sink for heat in the liquid The Stanford mirror relies on the best heat sink the universe itself The mirror is built from several layers of very thin materials The rst layer is re ective silver On top of this are layers of silicon dioxide and hafnium oxide These layers turn the mirror into a thermal radiator When silicon dioxide heats up it radiates the heat as infrared light at a wavelength of around ten micrometres and the heat passes straight out to space The total thickness of the mirror is around two micrometres or two thousandths of a millimetre The cold darkness of the universe can be used as a renewable thermodynamic resource even during the hottest hours of the day the scientists write in Nature In tests the mirror had a cooling power of 40 watts per square metre at outside temperatures WritinginthejournalFansaysthatthecostofthe mirrors is between 20 and 70 per square metre He calculates an annual electricity saving of 100MWh on a threestorey building Fan said that the mirror could cool buildings but he said that the mirrors would not slow down global warming Roof space is only a small portion of the Earths surface so the mirror is not a solution to the problem of global warming But our mirror will help limit greenhouse gas emissions by reducing electricity consumption he said Im really excited by the potential it has said Marin Soljai a physicist at

weekly food parcel from the food pantry The food helps them get through the cold dark Long Island winter The Hamptons are historic oceanfront towns and villages 100 miles from Manhattan New York In the summer it is full of billionaires But in early September the rich and famous shut up their mansions and go back to Manhattan or Beverly Hills The people who live here all year are mostly immigrants The people who come here are rich and famous but we who live here are not says Maria She works 14hour days in the summer cleaning mansions She often has no work at all in the winter Maria

94,A car with a maximum speed of 25 miles per hour two seats and no pedals or steering wheel does not sound very interesting But Google in the US shocked the car and taxi industries when it unveiled the latest version of its driverless car Google has begun testing the electric car at its headquarters in Mountain View California The car does not have all the normal car controls such as foot pedals Instead it has a smartphone app that calls it and tells it the destination and a STOP button between the two seats in case the passengers need to override the computer The company is building about 100 prototypes for a twoyear test The companys cofounder Sergey Brin said that the vehicle was still just a prototype He says that they want to change the world for people who do not find it easy to travel around Talking about the car he said Youre just sitting there no steering wheel no pedals For me it was very relaxing About ten seconds after getting into the car I forgot I was there I found it really fun Google says that the aim of the project is to improve safety They say that the car is made with foam at the front and a plastic windscreen so it should be far safer than any other car for pedestrians The cars have been built specially by a company in Detroit Google will now test the cars which are not yet for sale There need to be detailed scans of the roads before the cars can drive on them because they cannot collect and process enough information in real time So far there are detailed maps of about 2000 miles of Californias roads but California has more than 170000 miles of roads Google says it wants to license the technology to traditional car makers when they have improved it But the idea that driverless cars will replace taxis with human drivers has alarmed some people Dennis Conyon from the UK National Taxi Association said that taxi drivers will become unemployed London has about 22000 black taxis and Conyon thinks that the total number of people who drive taxis in the UK is about 100000 Other car makers including Volvo Ford and Mercedes are going to make vehicles that will be different from Googles version because they will have driver controls But Chris Urmson director of the driverless car project at Google said that the new prototypes do not have a steering wheel or brakes because a human passenger might not be able to take control in an emergency He said that it was simpler just to have an emergency stop button Urmson said The vehicles will be very basic But they will take you where you want to go at the push of a button And thats an important step towards improving road safety and helping millions of people travel around more easily So far the Google versions of the driverless cars have driven 700000 miles without an accident caused by the computer The company says that thousands of people die each year on the roads and that about 80 of crashes are caused by human mistakes,A car with a top speed of 25mph two seats and no pedals or steering wheel might not make much of an impression at a motor show But Google in the US sent a shock through the car and taxi industries as it unveiled the latest version of its driverless car The electrically powered vehicle which Google has begun testing around its headquarters in Mountain View California dispenses with all the normal controls including foot pedals Instead it has a smartphone app that calls it and tells it the destination and a single STOP button between the two frontfacing seats in case the passengers need to override the computer The car in fact does all the tasks of navigation steering acceleration and braking The company is building about 100 prototypes for a twoyear test The companys cofounder Sergey Brin told a conference in California that the vehicle was still in the prototype stage but that the project was about changing the world for people who do not have good transportation today He said of the car Youre just sitting there no steering wheel no pedals For me it was very relaxing About ten seconds after getting in I forgot I was there I found it really enjoyable Google says that the aim of the project is to improve safety and that because the car is constructed with impactabsorbing foam at the front and a plastic windscreen it should be far safer than any other car for pedestrians The cars which have been built specially by an unnamed company in Detroit will be used to find out how best to make driverless vehicles work Google will run a pilot programme using the cars which are not yet for sale One challenge is creating highdefinition scans of the roads and surroundings before the cars can drive along them because they cannot collect and process enough information in real time So far there are highdetail maps of about 2000 miles of Californias roads but the state has more than 170000 miles of public roads Google says it is interested in licensing the technology to traditional vehicle manufacturers once it has been refined But the idea of driverless cars replacing humandriven taxis has been the cause of some alarm Dennis Conyon of the UK National Taxi Association says that drivers will become unemployed London has about 22000 licensed black cabs and Conyon estimates that the total number of people who drive taxis for hire in the UK is about 100000 Other car makers including Volvo Ford and Mercedes are working on driverassisted vehicles which unlike Googles version do not dispense with the driver controls But Chris Urmson director of the selfdriving car project at Google said that the new prototypes dispensed with the steering wheel and brakes because a human passenger might not be able to take over in an emergency and that it was simpler just to have an emergency stop button Urmson said The vehicles will be very basic We want to learn from them and adapt them as quickly as possible But they will take you where you want to go at the push of a button And thats an important step towards improving road safety and improving mobility for millions of people So far the Google versions of the selfdriving cars have driven 700000 miles without an accident caused by the computer The

46,The age of the big British summer music festival including Glastonbury is ending according to the top rock manager Harvey Goldsmith He has produced and worked with most of the western worlds biggest music stars including the Who the Rolling Stones Queen Madonna Bob Dylan and Luciano Pavarotti He says that the biggest problem is a serious lack of major new bands to follow on from the old ones The age of the music festival peaked about two years ago he said speaking at the Hay Festival of Literature and Arts in Wales There are too many festivals and there are not enough big bands to headline them That is a big big problem for us And we are not producing new bands that can headline like the Rolling Stones Muse even the Arctic Monkeys There were about 900 music festivals in the UK between May and September in 2014 he said and they cannot all continue There will be lots of small combination festivals where it isnt just music but also poetry or books or magic shows Goldsmith 69 said that he is working with Robin de Levita the Dutch producer of the Whos 1970s rock musical Tommy They will bring the rst stage adaptation of the teen book and movie series The Hunger Games to a new 1100seat theatre in Wembley London in June 2016 Talking at Hay Goldsmith also revealed some of the secrets of his long career in the music industry He said that Keith Moon put dynamite down a Sydney hotel room toilet to unblock it And he said that John Lennon had stage fright at Madison Square Garden in 1974 he vomited and they had to push him onto the stage Its bizarre how common stage fright is among artists Its odd how afraid they get but as soon as the music starts theyre ne he said He also gave the answer to a rock n roll mystery why Elvis Presley never performed outside North America Presleys manager Colonel Tom Parker told Goldsmith that the real reason why Elvis never performed in England was because Parker was an immigrant He explained that it was because he was an illegal Dutch immigrant He didnt want to risk leaving the US said Goldsmith And his ultimate rock n roll performer Freddie Mercury was our most powerful stage performer the best live performer weve ever had But there is no group to follow Queen he said Were not producing a new generation of this kind of band Coldplay is probably the last one and that was ten years ago So with no big bands to headline there are no big shows Glastonbury now cant nd any more big bands The time of big music festivals is really ending,The age of the big British summer music festival including Glastonbury is

small combination festivals that give something extra not people standing around in a big eld unable to go to the toilet because they might miss the band Clearly the way music is delivered has changed he said People dont seem to want to listen to an album any more And most rock bands built their reputation on albums they might take three albums to become really good at their art to become great but young people dont want that Goldsmith 69 also revealed that he is working with Robin de Levita the Dutch producer of the Whos 1970s rock musical Tommy at a new 1100seat theatre in Wembley London where

also gave the answer to a longrunning rock n roll mystery why Elvis Presley never performed outside North America Presleys longtime manager Colonel Tom Parker admitted to him he said that the real

Margaret Aspinalls son James then 18 died at the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest She said the families had to fight for 23 years for the truth She said that the families sadness will never go away but she is very pleased that the Prime Minister said sorry for Hillsborough An independent panel looked at 450000 documents written by the police Sheffield Wednesday and all the other groups involved The panel then wrote a 395page report In the report they criticize official mistakes and say that the victims and other fans were not to blame We already knew the cause of the disaster but we didnt know that the police coverup was so big It is shocking how the police blamed the football fans for the disaster The panel found that the South Yorkshire Police led by the Chief Constable Peter Wright told their story that drunken fans or those without tickets caused the disaster They tested the victims blood for alcohol When victims had alcohol in their blood the police then checked to find if they had criminal records The police said that many Liverpool fans were very drunk were without tickets and were very violent but the report found no evidence for this The report said that Wright met with police in a Sheffield restaurant to prepare a defence and a story The meeting happened just four days after the disaster It was the day that The Sun newspaper published its headline The Truth and the story by four senior South Yorkshire police officers The panel found that officers statements were changed to remove criticism of the police and emphasize bad behaviour by fans The panel found that 116 of 164 statements were changed to remove or change negative comments about South Yorkshire police The police said this was done only to remove opinion from the statements but the panel said they did more than that It was done to remove criticism of the police the report said The original inquiry did not believe this propaganda It decided in August 1989 that the police stories of fan drunkenness and violence were false and it criticized the police for telling lies It said that Sheffield Wednesdays stadium was unsafe that the Football Association chose that stadium for the match without even checking if it had a safety certificate It did not have a certificate But the main cause of the disaster was the way the police controlled the crowd The police lost control outside the stadium where 24000 Liverpool fans had to go through just 23 small entrance gates So police opened a large exit gate and lots of people were allowed in They did not close one of the tunnels and the inquiry said this was their big mistake But the police still repeated their lies at the inquest The coroner decided not to take evidence of what happened after 315pm on the day of the disaster so he did not look at the chaotic behaviour of the police and the ambulance service The panel found that if the police and ambulance service had done their jobs better they could have saved 41 of the 96 lives lost There may now be a new inquest There may be prosecutions too after all these years of Sheffield Wednesday South Yorkshire Police and Sheffield City Council which was responsible for the safety of the stadium Trevor Hicks whose two daughters died in the disaster said The truth is out today Hicks said Tomorrow is for justice,During a momentous day at Liverpool Cathedral for the families of the 96 people who died so needlessly at Sheffield Wednesdays Hillsborough football ground you could hear one phrase again and again the truth These were the words used in a headline in The Sun newspaper We now know that the story in the newspaper was given to the paper by the South Yorkshire Police to move the blame for the disaster onto the innocent victims Margaret Aspinalls son James then 18 died at the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest She said the families had had to fight for 23 years for the truth Aspinall Chairperson of the Hillsborough Family Support Group said that the families loss would never go away but she was delighted that the Prime Minister gave a profound apology for Hillsborough An independent panel studied 450000 documents created by the police Sheffield Wednesday and all other bodies responsible Then it produced a 395page report criticizing official mistakes and highlighting the fact that the victims and other fans were not responsible Some of the causes of the disaster have been exposed before but the depth of the coverup was still shocking in particular the police campaign to falsely blame the supporters The panel found that the South Yorkshire Police led by the Chief Constable Peter Wright told their story that drunken supporters or those without tickets had caused the disaster The victims blood was tested for alcohol levels This was an exceptional decision the panel said and it found no rationale for it When victims had alcohol in their blood the police then checked to find if they had criminal records The report found there was no evidence to prove the serious allegations of exceptional levels of drunkenness ticketlessness or violence among Liverpool fans The report found that Wright met his police federation in a Sheffield restaurant to prepare a defence and a rocksolid story The meeting was held just four days after the disaster It was the day that The Sun newspaper published its headline The Truth over lies told to it by four senior South Yorkshire police officers The panel found that officers statements were changed to delete criticism of the police and emphasize misbehaviour by supporters The panel found that 116 of 164 statements were changed to remove or change negative comments about South Yorkshire police The police had claimed they changed statements only to remove opinion but the panel had no doubt they did more than that It was done to remove criticism of the police the report said This propaganda did not convince the original inquiry It found in August 1989 that the police stories of fan drunkenness and misbehaviour were false and criticized the police for making the claims It revealed that Sheffield Wednesdays football ground was unsafe that the Football Association had chosen it as the stadium for the match without even checking if it had a valid safety certificate it did not But it was the mismanagement of the crowd by the police led by an inexperienced Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield that was the main cause of the disaster The police lost control outside the ground where 24000 Liverpool fans had to go through just 23 turnstiles so Duckenfield ordered a large exit gate to be opened and a large number of people to be allowed in His mistake according to the inquiry was the failure to close the tunnel that led to the central section behind the goal which was already overcrowded But the police still repeated their claims at the inquest The coroner decided not to take evidence of what happened after 315pm on the day of the disaster so the chaotic emergency response was not examined The panel found that 41 of the 96 who died could possibly have been saved if the police and ambulance service had done their jobs properly Following the panels report the Attorney General will now decide whether to have a new inquest There may be prosecutions too after all these years of Sheffield Wednesday South Yorkshire Police and Sheffield City Council which failed in its duty to oversee safety of the football ground Trevor Hicks President of the Hillsborough Family Support Group whose two teenage daughters died in the disaster said The truth is out today

116,It is no longer legal to smoke a cigarette inside a bar in the worlds drinking capital New Orleans Louisiana Since Hurricane Katrina in 2005 New Orleans city government has begun trying to reduce noise problems The city is now stricter on noise in bars and nightclubs and at the same time it has introduced new rules on noise It is the wrong time for this complains barowner William Walker He hates the antismoking law If they force people outside the bar to smoke it is going to increase the tension thats already there Many of New Orleanss best bars are in quiet neighbourhoods Martha Wood lives beside a loud bar that has live music The bar was one reason I bought the house so I wont ever complain about the noise says Wood She also manages a livemusic bar The Maple Leaf club became smokefree in 2014 Another club also became smokefree because performers asked for smokefree nights A lot of the performance venues were already starting to show that consideration to performers I wish the city had just let that happen not force the ban into every bar that doesnt have music says Zalia BeVille manager of the All Ways Lounge Luckily All Ways has an outdoor patio Another bar Lost Love Lounge doesnt have a patio The owner Geoff Douville loves the ban before he felt forced to live with smoke to keep his bar popular I couldnt ban smoking in my bar without a ban in the whole city says Douville People think I have that choice But if I make a nosmoking rule they will choose another bar with smoking Many small business owners also fear that the smokefree rule will make them lose money Neil Timms owns an English pub and saw a smoking ban before in England Back home in England every pub I knew closed because of the smoking ban remembers Timms of Englands ban which began in 2007 To avoid the same problems hes spending money to build a patio But Douville feels the ban could be a great business opportunity There are lots of people who would enjoy coming to our bar but they never came because they didnt want to smell like smoke for the next seven days now those people can come Douville isnt worried about noise complaints No court is going to say a bar is a nuisance after the city has introduced a smoking ban that forces you to go outside he says Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell who introduced the ban disagrees The responsibility is on the barowner to keep their customers respectful outside as well she says The owners need to tell them to go and have a smoke but be respectful to their communities The idea that we cant have clean air because it will cause noise problems is ridiculous We can have clean air without noise problems I think its about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses Many people were worried that the police would not have time to give bars warnings and nes So the health department will do it Bar customers must ll out a form or call 311 and include photographs of illegal smoking Geoff Douville says that hes used to noise complaints You will see the neighbours who complain about the noise now are going to be the same ones who wanted the smoking ban Of course theyre going to complain he adds But it doesnt mean theyre going to win,It is no longer legal to smoke a cigarette inside a bar in the worlds drinking capital New Orleans Louisiana Many other cities have banned indoor smoking but New Orleans is different it attracts tourists with a let the good times roll attitude An indoor smoking ban in New Orleans could have unique consequences Since Hurricane Katrina in 2005 New Orleans city government has begun trying to turn down the volume a bit With the support of neighbourhood groups the city has begun policing bars and nightclubs more strictly while at the same time ghting to implement a new noise ordinance This is just the wrong time for something like this complains barowner William Walker who hates the antismoking law Forcing people outside the bar to smoke is going to increase the tension thats already there Many of New Orleanss best bars and live music venues are in quiet residential neighbourhoods This neighbourly coexistence is a big part of what makes New Orleans different and charming But recently this unique social contract has become unacceptable for some people and the fate of New Orleanss musical personality feels at risk Martha Wood lives beside a loud bar that hosts live music I bought the house partly because of the bar so I wont ever complain about the noise says Wood who also manages a livemusic bar This bar became one of New Orleanss rst ever bars legally banned from serving drinks to go after a series of noise issues in 2013 including complaints about the loud smokers outside The Maple Leaf club went smokefree voluntarily in 2014 The same happened at another club where artists had been demanding smokefree nights A lot of the performance venues were already starting to show that consideration to performers so I wish the city would have just let that happen instead of forcing the ban into every corner bar that doesnt host music says Zalia BeVille manager of the All Ways Lounge Luckily All Ways has an outdoor patio unlike Lost Love Lounge whose owner Geoff Douville loves the ban hed previously felt forced to live with smoke to keep his bar going Theres no way I could have banned smoking in my bar without a ban throughout the whole city says Douville People act like I have that choice as a business owner But if I make that rule customers walk down the block to a bar with smoking Many small business owners also fear smoke free revenue loss Smoker Neil Timms owns an English pub and met the smoking ban before in England Back home in England every pub I knew closed within a year of the smoking ban remembers Timms of the UKs ban begun in 2007 He doesnt want his pub to close so hes spending money to build a patio But Douville feels the ban could be a great business opportunity There are lots of people who would enjoy coming out to our bar with our food but would never come because they didnt want to smell like smoke for the next seven days were now an option for all those people Nor does Douville worry about noise complaints No court is going to say a bar is a nuisance after the city has rati ed a smoking ban that requires you to go outside he says Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell who introduced the ban disagrees The responsibility is on the barowner to keep their customers respectful outside as well she says The owners and bartenders need to tell them to go and have a smoke but be respectful to their communities The idea that we cant have clean air because it will cause noise problems is ridiculous We can have clean air without noise problems I think its about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses Cantrell recognizes that the city is different How is New Orleans different from the rest of the country New Orleans is known as a place where you can relax and have fun she says New Orleans needs to stand up and say We care about our people The most vulnerable people who are working in smoky conditions are the backbone of our hospitality industry which drives the economy in the state of Louisiana Many were worried that the police would not have time to enforce the ban So the health department will handle bar warnings and nes Bar customers are encouraged to ll out a form or call 311 and to include photographs of illegal smoking For this reason alone Neil Timms says hell comply with the ban I dont want someone to be sitting in the corner smoking and someone takes a photo and gets beaten up Unworried Geoff Douville says that hes used to noise complaints by now You will see the nosy neighbours who complain about the noise now are going to be the same ones who wanted the smoking ban In the end Douville shares Cantrells optimism Of course theyre going to complain he accepts But it doesnt mean theyre going to

155,Police and intelligence agencies around the world have for almost 100 years used the polygraph a liedetector test to help catch criminals and spies But now researchers in Britain and the Netherlands have developed a new method which is correct in tests over 70 of the time Police stations around the world might begin using this new method within ten years It doesnt monitor movements in the face talking too much or waving arms all signs that someone is lying The new method monitors movements in the whole body which can show that the person is feeling guilty The polygraph is often used in the US in criminal cases and by the FBI and CIA but is much less popular in Europe Many people do not believe that it is reliable The basic idea behind the new method is that liars fidget more and that an allbody motion suit the kind used in films to create computergenerated characters will record this The new method is over 70 reliable the polygraph is only 55 reliable In some tests the success rate of the new method was more than 80 Ross Anderson one of the research team said Guilty people fidget more and we can now measure this The polygraph was created in 1921 by policeman John Larson It records changes in pulse blood pressure sweating and breathing to find out if someone is lying In movies the polygraph is always correct but in 1998 the US Supreme Court decided that there was no agreement that the polygraph was reliable The US National Academy of Scientists said the same thing in 2003 The tests Anderson and his colleagues did involved 180 students and employees at Lancaster University Half of the people were told to tell the truth and half to lie The researchers interviewed some of the people about a computer game called Never End that they played for seven minutes Others lied about playing it The second test involved a lost wallet with 5 inside Some people had to bring the wallet to a lostandfound box Others hid it and lied about it The new bodysuit method was correct 822 of the time Researchers monitored how much the people moved their arms and legs to decide if they were telling the truth or lying Allbody suits are expensive they cost about 30000 and they can be uncomfortable so Anderson and his colleagues are now looking at cheaper alternatives These include using motionsensing technology from computer games such as the Kinect devices developed by Microsoft for the Xbox console,Police and intelligence agencies around the world have for almost 100 years used lie detectors to help convict criminals or find spies and traitors But the polygraph could soon be defunct Researchers in Britain and the Netherlands have developed a new method that has a success rate in tests of over 70 This new method could be in use in police stations around the world within a decade It doesnt monitor facial tics talking too much or waving of arms which are all signs that someone is lying The new method monitors fullbody motion which can show that the person is feeling guilty The polygraph is widely used in the US in criminal cases and for security clearance for the FBI and CIA but is much less popular in Europe Many people in the scientific and legal communities do not believe that it is reliable By contrast the new method has performed well in experiments The basic thought is that liars fidget more and so the use of an allbody motion suit the kind used in films to create computergenerated characters will record this The suit has 17 sensors that register movement up to 120 times per second in three dimensions for 23 joints One of the research team Ross Anderson professor of security engineering at Cambridge University said that years of research show that an interviewer will know whether someone is telling the truth and not lies in only about 55 times out of 100 He said the new method by contrast was right over 70 of the time And he was confident they would be able to do better In some tests the team has already achieved more than 80 Anderson said Guilty people fidget more and we can measure this Anderson added that the research had a special significance at this time because of a recent US Senate report on torture by the CIA There are problems with torture from a moral point of view but it is also a very unreliable way of getting accurate information We have known for a long time that torture does not work Anderson said The new method offers a good alternative to interviews The research paper was written by Dr Sophie van der Zee of Cambridge University Professor Ronald Poppe of Utrecht University Professor Paul Taylor of Lancaster University and Anderson The polygraph was created in 1921 by policeman John Larson It records changes in pulse blood pressure sweating and breathing to find out whether someone is lying In movies the polygraph is always right But in 1998 the US Supreme Court ruled that there was no consensus that the polygraph was reliable This conclusion was supported by the US National Academy of Scientists in 2003 The experiment carried out by Anderson and his colleagues involved 180 students and employees at Lancaster University half of the people were told to tell the truth and half to lie They were each paid 750 for their participation in the 70minute experiment involving two tests Some were interviewed about a computer game Never End which they played for seven minutes Others lied about playing the game they had only seen notes about it The second test involved a lost wallet containing 5 Some were asked to bring the wallet to a lostandfound box Others hid it and lied about it Overall we correctly guessed whether 822 truths 889 lies 756 of the interviewees were telling the truth or lying based on the movements in their individual limbs the report says Anderson said First we looked at how much different body parts showed that someone was lying We found that liars wave their arms more but this is only at the 60 level that you can get from a polygraph The success came when we looked at total body motion That tells truth from lies over 70 of the time and we believe we can improve it even more by combining it with optimal questioning techniques Another advantage is that total body motion is mostly the same in people who have different cultural backgrounds and different levels of anxiety these things confuse other liedetection technologies Anderson said The use of allbody suits is expensive they cost about 30000 and they can be uncomfortable so Anderson and his colleagues are now studying lowcost alternatives These include using motionsensing technology from computer games such as the Kinect devices developed by Microsoft for the Xbox Anderson admits that intelligence agencies such as the CIA could teach agents how to trick the fullbody motion method by keeping their bodies completely still But he said that in itself would be a giveaway,validation,ELE,INT

6,People today might not hear the sounds of the natural world because they screen out the noises around them says a US researcher More background noise can make people oblivious to the uplifting sounds of birdsong water and trees in the wind You can often hear these sounds even in cities said Kurt Fristrup a senior scientist at the US National Park Service The problem is even worse because people listen to music through their earphones instead of listening to the birds and other sounds of nature Natural sounds are easily drowned out by traf c music and others noises Fristrup said This learned deafness is a real problem Fristrup told the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in San Jose We are training ourselves to ignore the information that comes into our ears This gift that we are born with the ability to hear things hundreds of metres away all these incredible sounds might be lost he said This is the problem we hear so many noises that we stop listening For the past ten years the US National Park Service has recorded sound levels at more than 600 parks in the US including Yosemite in California Yellowstone and Denali in Alaska There was noise from human activity in all the parks for example aircraft motorbikes motorboats and tour buses Fristrups team say that noise pollution more than doubles every 30 years Its not surprising people put on earphones he said More background noise has the same effect on your hearing as fog has on your vision you are aware of only a small area around you he said Even in our cities there are birds and things to appreciate in the environment but we are losing the ability to hear them People quickly become used to changes in their environments including more noise Fristrup worries that we will forget how much quieter the world could be If nding peace and quiet becomes too dif cult many children will grow up without the experience and I think its a very big problem he said Other scientists reported health bene ts from listening to natural sounds Speaking at the same meeting Derrick Taff a social scientist at Pennsylvania State University said that listening to recordings from national parks of waterfalls birdsong and wind helped people feel less stressed We know that natural sounds are very important to people They are some of the main reasons people visit protected areas They want to hear the natural quiet the birdsong and the wind and water Taff said We may be losing this as people are listening to their iPods all the time My advice is to go to your protected areas and experience what you are missing,The tranquil sounds of the natural world might be lost to todays generation as people screen out the noises that surround them a senior US researcher warns Rising levels of background noise in some areas threaten to make people oblivious to the uplifting sounds of birdsong trickling water and trees rustling in the wind These sounds can often be heard even in urban centres said Kurt Fristrup a senior scientist at the US National Park Service The problem was made worse by people listening to music through their earphones instead of tuning in to the birds and other sounds of nature that can easily be drowned out by traf c music and others noises he said This learned deafness is a real problem Fristrup told the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in San Jose We are training ourselves to ignore the information coming into our ears This gift that we are born with to hear things hundreds of metres away all these incredible sounds might be lost he said The danger is that we are exposed to noise for so long that we stop listening We are also losing the ability to engage with the environment in the way we were built to he added For the past ten years the US National Park Service has recorded sound levels at more than 600 places across the US including Yosemite in California Yellowstone and Denali in Alaska All the places were affected by some form of noise from human activity aircraft motorbikes motorboats or tour buses Fristrups team combined the sound levels recorded from national parks with similar data from urban settings to create a model of noise levels across the US They say that noise pollution more than doubles every 30 years Its not surprising people are putting on earphones or even noise cancelling headphones to try and create a quieter environment he said As you raise background sound levels it has the same effect on your hearing as fog would have on your vision Instead of having this expansive experience of all the sounds around you you are aware of only a small area around you he said Even in our cities there are birds and things to appreciate in the environment but the ability to hear them is being lost People quickly become used to changes in their environments including rising noise levels and over time Fristrup fears that we will accept far worse environmental conditions than we should and forget how much quieter the world could be If nding peace and quiet becomes too dif cult many many children will grow up without the experience and I think its a very real problem he said The warning came as other scientists reported health bene ts from listening to natural sounds Speaking at the same meeting Derrick Taff a social scientist at Pennsylvania State University described preliminary experiments which suggest that listening to recordings from national parks of waterfalls birdsong and wind helped people recover from stressful events In one experiment Taff told people who visited his lab to give an unplanned talk that would be judged by researchers standing behind a oneway mirror Measurements of their heart rate and the stress hormone cortisol before and after the speech found that people calmed down faster when they listened to nature recordings than when the same soundtracks also contained noises from road traf c aeroplanes and even normal conversation We know that natural sounds are very important to people They are some of the main reasons people visit protected areas They want to hear the natural quiet the birdsong and the wind and water Taff said We may be losing this as people are listening to their iPods all the time My advice is to go to your protected areas and experience what you are missing Why natural sounds might be calming to people is unclear but Fristrup thinks that over millions of years of evolution we may have come to associate the more tranquil sounds of the natural world with safety I suspect theres something about these sounds that reminds our brains of a place thats safe he said,validation,ELE,INT
182,George W Bush Benedict Cumberbatch and Stephen Hawking have done it David Cameron Barack Obama and Pamela Anderson have refused to do it The Ice Bucket Challenge began in the US in July It has raised 100 million for the ALS Association an American motor neurone disease charity and 45 million for a British charity as well as thousands of pounds for charities in Hong Kong and Australia But some people are unhappy with the Ice Bucket Challenge Animalrights groups and environmentalists people who want to protect the natural world have criticized it Some people say it wastes water Other people criticize it because some people enjoy the fun and then do not donate anything to charity But the challenge continues to grow If you dont know how it works someone gives a short speech to camera about the charity then throws a bucket of ice cubes in water over their head or asks a friend to do it Then they give the names of three other people who have to do the same or donate money to the charity It was an unlucky coincidence that the Ice Bucket Challenge was happening during World Water Week when people from all over the world met in Stockholm to discuss the planets water crisis The charity WaterAid is asking people to use recycled water from their baths or rainwater from their gardens or to use sea water Douglas Graham of the UK Motor Neurone Association said We are not surprised about the criticism but this is a wonderful windfall and were so grateful We didnt expect it but suddenly the donations just started The money is a very big help to a small charity that looks after sufferers of a terrible disease that has no cure and kills five people a day in the UK Former Baywatch star and animalrights activist Pamela Anderson wrote a public letter to the ALS Association In the letter she said that she did not like the charitys use of animal experimentation A few US stars have rejected the challenge because of Californias drought Actor Matt Damon solved the problem by using water from his toilet Actor Verne Troyer used milk also for environmental reasons And some people say the challenge caused a water shortage on the Scottish island of Colonsay Another criticism is that small charities wont know what to do with the extra money but the MND Association rejects this Oh we know what to do with the extra money here said Graham We pay for research to find the causes of the disease and a treatment or cure We give care and support to 3500 people and they need it because this disease is expensive to manage More than 50 of people with the disease die within two years But for many people with a connection to the disease the awareness that the challenge has created is as important as the money Normally the MND Association gets about 300000 hits a year on its website On just one day recently it had 330000 hits It is great to donate to any charity I understand that some people might want to donate to a different charity said Graham In 2013 British people gave 62 billion to charity we should be proud of that Its fabulous for us to get this windfall Over the next few weeks we will decide how to spend the money in the best way,George W Bush Benedict Cumberbatch and Stephen Hawking have done it David Cameron Barack Obama and Pamela Anderson have refused to do it The Ice Bucket Challenge began in the US in July and has raised 100m for the ALS Association a US motorneuronedisease charity and 45m for a British one as well as thousands more for charities in Hong Kong and Australia However not everyone is happy with the Ice Bucket Challenge Commentators animalrights groups and environmentalists have all criticized it for reasons ranging from the waste of water to the fact that some people enjoy the fun and then do not donate anything to charity Meanwhile the challenge continues to grow For anyone who doesnt know how it works someone gives a short speech to camera about the charity then dumps a bucket of ice cubes in water over their head or gets a friend to do it Then they nominate three other people to either do the same or donate It was an unfortunate coincidence that 31 August to 5 September was World Water Week with international delegates arriving in Stockholm to discuss the planets water crisis The charity WaterAid is asking people to use recycled water from bathtubs or garden butts or to use sea water Douglas Graham the UK Motor Neurone Associations fundraising director said The criticism is to be expected but really this is just a wonderful windfall and were so grateful We didnt see it coming but suddenly the donations just started The boost is an enormous help to a small charity looking after sufferers of a debilitating littleunderstood disease that has no cure and kills five people a day in the UK Former Baywatch star Pamela Anderson an animalrights activist wrote an open letter to the ALS Association saying she could not support its record on animal experimentation A few US stars have rejected the challenge because of Californias drought Actor Matt Damon solved the problem by using water from his toilet Actor Verne Troyer used milk again saying it was for environmental reasons And the challenge has been blamed for causing a water shortage on the Scottish island of Colonsay In Australia a TV anchorman apologized over his strong no thanks response to being nominated Lincoln Humphries had said Instead of pouring fresh water over your own head and wasting ice here is a list of charities helping communities in desperate need of money across the world Id like to nominate everyone everywhere who has more than they need to donate what they can to the people who need it most because that is what charity is about not putting yourself through mild discomfort with a bucket of icy water Another criticism has been that small charities wont be able to cope with the extra money but the MND Association rejected this Oh we can cope here said Graham We fund worldclass research into the causes of the disease to find a treatment or cure We provide care and support for 3500 people and they need it because this is such a rapidly progressing disease and its expensive to manage Over 50 die within two years of diagnosis Its heartbreaking to see the decline in people we work with over just a few months But for many people with a connection to the disease the awareness that the challenge has created is as valuable as the money Graham says it is priceless Normally the MND Association gets around 300000 hits a year on its website On a single day recently it had 330000 We couldnt have created this if wed tried Charities are all worthwhile causes and I understand that some people might want to donate to a different one In 2013 British people gave 62bn to charity we should be proud of that Its fabulous for us to get this windfall Well be sitting down over the next few weeks to work out how to spend it in the best way but I assure you every penny will count for
