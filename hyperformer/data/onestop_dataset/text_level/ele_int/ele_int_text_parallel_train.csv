45,If we reduced the amount of food we wasted around the world by just 25 there would be enough food to feed all the hungry people in the world Each year we waste 13 billion tonnes of food about one third of all the food we produce This includes about 45 of all fruit and vegetables 35 of sh and seafood 30 of cereals 20 of dairy products and 20 of meat We waste food like this when at the same time 795 million people suffer from hunger The problem is global but is different in different parts of the world In developing countries there is a lot of food loss this is when food is lost because of poor equipment transportation and so on In rich countries there are low levels of food loss but high levels of food waste which means people throw away food because they have bought too much or shops reject food because it doesnt look good In developed countries people and shops throw away between 30 and 40 of all food bought but in poorer countries people throw away only 5 to 16 In the developing world there is almost no food waste says Robert van Otterdijk coordinator of the UN Food and Agriculture Organizations Save Food programme Food waste is happening in countries where people have more money so they can throw away food But there is a lot of food loss in developing countries because of the poor conditions they have The environmental impact of food loss and waste is high The carbon footprint of food produced and not eaten is 33 gigatonnes of CO2 This means that if food waste were a country it would produce more greenhouse gases than any country except the US and China We cause the problem of climate change because we produce and use too much we are not in balance with what the Earth can provide says van Otterdijk Production of food is one of the biggest production sectors in the world If we waste onethird of all this you can imagine what a huge effect this has on the natural resources on land water energy and greenhouse gases The US Canada Australia and New Zealand produce the most food waste People in those countries waste 39 of all the food they buy The next is Europe where people throw away about 31 of all the food they buy In the UK 15 million tonnes of food is lost or wasted each year British people throw away 42 million tonnes of edible food each year This means that 117 of all food people buy is wasted which costs each family 700 a year The foods most often found in British bins are bread vegetables fruit and milk The most wasted food in the UK by weight is bread people throw away 414000 tonnes 224 of all the bread they buy By percentage the most wasted food is lettuce and leafy salads people throw away 38 64000 tonnes of all they buy The UK has improved in the past ten years thanks to a campaign to reduce waste Van Otterdijk says the UK has been very successful in reducing food waste Between 2007 and 2012 the amount of food waste produced by UK households decreased by 21 from 53 million tonnes to 42 million tonnes Van Otterdijk says that more and more people are interested in food waste and this is great We have to do much more and companies and governments also need to help he says But if it continues like this maybe after ten years the situation around the world will be better,If the amount of food wasted around the world were reduced by just 25 there would be enough food to feed all the people who are malnourished according to the UN Each year 13bn tonnes of food about a third of all that is produced is wasted This includes about 45 of all fruit and vegetables 35 of sh and seafood 30 of cereals 20 of dairy products and 20 of meat Meanwhile 795 million people suffer from severe hunger and malnutrition The UN identi es the problem of food waste as one of the great challenges to achieving food security By 2050 food production will have to increase by 60 compared to 2005 levels to feed a growing global population Reducing food waste would help to meet future demand The problem is global but appears in very different ways In developing countries there is a lot of food loss which is unintentional waste often due to poor equipment transportation and infrastructure In wealthy countries there are low levels of food loss but high levels of food waste which means food is thrown away by consumers because they have purchased too much or by retailers who reject food because of strict standards of appearance In developed countries consumers and retailers throw away between 30 and 40 of all food purchased whereas in poorer countries only 5 to 16 of food is thrown away In the developing world food waste is almost nonexistent says Robert van Otterdijk coordinator of the UN Food and Agriculture Organizations Save Food programme Food waste is happening in countries where people can afford to throw away food But on the other hand there are a lot of food losses in developing countries because of the underdeveloped conditions they have The environmental impact of food loss and waste is high The carbon footprint of food produced and not eaten is estimated at 33 gigatonnes of CO2 this means that if food waste were a country it would be the third highest emitter of greenhouse gases after the US and China About 30 of available agricultural land is used to grow or farm food that is subsequently wasted And more surface and groundwater is used to produce wasted food around the globe than is used for agriculture by any single country including India and China Climate change is caused by our economy of production and consumption because it is out of balance with what the Earth can provide says van Otterdijk Production of food is one of the biggest production sectors in the world and if onethird of all this is wasted you can imagine what a huge effect this has on the natural resources on land water energy and greenhouse gas emissions The places that waste the most food are the US Canada Australia and New Zealand where consumers waste 39 of all food purchased Next is Europe where about 31 of all food purchased by consumers is thrown away In the UK 15m tonnes of food is lost or wasted each year British consumers throw away 42m tonnes of edible food each year This means that 117 of all food purchased is wasted which costs each family 700 a year The foods most commonly found in British bins are bread vegetables fruit and milk The most wasted food in the UK by weight is bread with consumers throwing away 414000 tonnes 224 of all bread purchased By percentage the most wasted food is lettuce and leafy salads of which consumers throw away 38 64000 tonnes of all they buy The UK has

by UK households decreased by 21 from 53m tonnes to 42m tonnes largely due to greater awareness Van Otterdijk says there has been a very encouraging unexpected continuing interest in food waste and this enables campaigns around the world to gain momentum We have to do much more and it needs the participation of public and private sectors he says But if it continues like this maybe after ten

113,We do not yet live in an age of ying cars as predicted in the 1985 lm Back to the Future II but smartphones and other new technologies are creating exciting possibilities Experts agree that economic and population changes new technology and environmental concerns are having a big effect on transportation With an ageing transport infrastructure cities in the US have to change and improve their transportation Experts and scientists now realize that old ways of reducing traf c congestion arent enough to solve the problems of population growth and carbon emissions and transportation is now an environmental problem Big US cities like Los Angeles and Chicago are adding more bus lanes and pedestrian walkways and expanding rail networks At the same time they are creating advanced technologies that will allow a vehicle to drive itself and communicate with other vehicles and its environment Here are three of the key ideas that experts predict will change transportation in the future Connectivity Taxisharing services like Uber and apps like Waze which nds the quickest routes for drivers are completely changing how people move around and affecting the way traf c moves through a city Communication between riders and drivers between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era According to a recent study people born in the 1990s are using cars less than older generations According to the study people born in the 1990s are making 4 fewer car trips and travelling 18 fewer miles per year on average than older generations did at the same time in their lives And people who still drive cars are experiencing less traf c thanks to Waze Traf c congestion is improving in other ways too At the moment a traf c light knows when a car is getting close but thats all Companies are developing technology that allows a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling Automation We have known about driverless cars ever since Google began testing the vehicles in 2012 but noone really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace But there is already some automation of cars Automation will probably happen in stages rst there might be automated buses with their own lanes then perhaps lorries in ports or mining towns vehicles that are connected electronically and travel one behind another The idea of a fully automated transportation system is interesting because it could improve safety peoples mistakes wont cause accidents any more It could also help reduce carbon emissions and traf c congestion But it will take a long time to get fully automated because the average age of cars on the road is 115 years old To see what driverless cars might look like on the road go to the video at vimeocom37751380 Environmental concern The world is trying to slow down climate change and countries and cities are trying to reduce emissions These things could have a big effect on the future of transportation and lead to zero and lowemission vehicles and apps that encourage more walking cycling and carpooling When thinking about the future of transportation its also important to think about why people travel they may be going to work to meet friends or family or to do the shopping Technologies that reduce the need for those trips for example online meetings or online work could also have a big effect on transportation,We may not yet be living in an age of ying cars as predicted in the 1985 lm Back to the Future II but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is just as exciting and almost as farfetched Experts agree that economic and demographic changes technological advances and environmental concerns are fundamentally changing transportation Its a very dynamic time said transport expert Robert Puentes Theres a tighter connection between transportation and the economic health of cities and its impact on people As the transport infrastructure grows old cities across the US are forced to rede ne what transportation is Urban planners transportation experts and scientists are now realizing that old methods focused on reducing traf c congestion arent enough to solve problems like population growth and carbon emissions and transportation is now a key part of protecting the environment Big US cities like Los Angeles and Chicago are working to make better use of their streets by adding more bus lanes and pedestrian walkways and expanding rail networks At the same time they are working on advanced technologies that will allow a vehicle to drive itself and communicate with other vehicles and its environment The most sustainable places to live are places that have multimodal transport systems Puentes said Here are three key ideas that experts predict will in uence transportation in the coming years Connectivity Ridesharing services like Uber taxis booked via smartphone and apps like Waze which uses realtime traf c data to nd the quickest routes for drivers are dramatically changing how people move around and affecting the way traf c moves through a city Communication between riders and drivers between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era according to Allan Clelland an expert on transportation technology According to a recent study car travel has reduced among people born in the 1990s compared to previous generations According to the study people born in the 1990s are making 4 fewer car trips and travelling 18 fewer miles per year on average than members of previous generations did at the same stage in their lives People still driving cars are dealing with less traf c thanks to Waze Experts say the traf c app has reduced congestion on motorways and reduced travel times for drivers But it has also led to a problematic rise in cars moving through residential neighbourhoods This trend could continue as vehicletovehicle data communication as well as communication between vehicles and the surrounding infrastructure grows Currently a traf c light knows when a car is getting close but thats all Companies are working to develop technology that will allow a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling Automation Driverless cars have been in the headlines ever since Google began road testing the vehicles back in 2012 but noone really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace However the partial automation of cars is already underway Automation will probably happen in stages rst there might be automated buses with their own lanes then perhaps lorries in ports or mining towns that is vehicles that are connected electronically and travel in single le The idea of a fully automated transportation system is intriguing because it could improve safety by removing human error It could also help reduce carbon emissions and traf c congestion and allow more people access to cars But even if driverless technology were ready to use now it would take a long time to get fully automated because the average age of cars on the road is 115 years old To see what driverless cars might look like in action go to the video at vimeocom37751380 Environmental concern As the world races to avoid catastrophic climate change and countries and cities work to meet ambitious emissions goals these policies could also have a big effect on the future of transportation Concern about the environment could lead to everything from zero and lowemission vehicles to apps that encourage more walking biking and carpooling When considering the future of transportation its also important to keep in mind why people travel they may be going to work to meet friends or family or to do the shopping Technologies that reduce the need for those trips for example virtual meetings or telecommuting could also have a big effect on transportation In the past the idea of a ying car represented the best in innovation but the technologies that people are imagining and developing now are possibly even more sophisticated and more useful in solving the social and environmental problems that we face in the coming decades,train,ELE,INT
97,Scientists have connected the brains of two rats and allowed them to share information Researchers say this is an important step towards creating the worlds first organic computer The US team put electronic brain devices on two rats The devices let the animals work together on simple tasks to earn rewards such as a drink of water In one important demonstration of the technology the scientists used the internet to connect the brains of two rats thousands of miles away from each other One in North Carolina USA and the other in Natal Brazil The head of the research team was Miguel Nicolelis who has made devices that allow paralyzed people to control computers and robotic arms with their thoughts The researchers say their latest work could make it possible to connect many brains to share information These experiments showed that we have created a direct communication connection between brains Nicolelis said We are creating an organic computer The scientists have shown that rats can share information and respond to that information The scientists do this by electrically connecting the rats brains They trained the rats to press a lever when they saw a light above it When they did the task correctly they got some water To test the animals ability to share brain information they put the rats in two separate compartments Only one compartment had a light above the lever When the rat pressed the lever an electronic version of its brain activity was sent directly to the other rats brain In tests the second rat responded correctly to the first rats brain signals and pressed the lever 70 of the time Incredibly the communication between the rats was twoway If the rat that received the information failed the task the first rat did not get the reward of a drink It then seemed to change its behaviour to make the task easier for its partner In further experiments the rats worked together on a task where they had to tell the difference between narrow and wide openings using their whiskers In the final test the scientists connected rats on different continents and used the internet to send their brain activity The animals were on different continents but they could still communicate said Miguel PaisVieira the first author of the study This tells us that we could create a network of animal brains with the animals in many different locations Nicolelis said the team is now trying to find ways of linking many animals brains at once to solve more difficult tasks We do not know what might happen when animals begin interacting as part of a brainnet he said In theory you could imagine that a combination of brains could find solutions that individual brains cannot find alone Anders Sandberg of Oxford University said the work was very important in helping to understand how brains process information But the possible future uses of the technology are much wider said Sandberg The main reason humans control the planet is that we are very good at communicating and coordinating Without that although we are very clever animals we would not control the planet I dont think these experiments will create very smart rats he added Theres a big difference between sharing information through the senses and being able to plan Im not worried about clever rats taking control of the world We know very little about how people process thoughts and how they could be sent to another persons brain so that will not happen any time soon And much of what is in our minds is what Sandberg calls a draft of what we might do And we change a lot of those drafts before we do anything Most of the time I think its very good that our thoughts are not in someone elses head,Scientists have connected the brains of two animals and allowed them to share sensory information It is a major step towards what the researchers call the worlds first organic computer The US team fitted two rats with devices called braintobrain interfaces that let the animals collaborate on simple tasks to earn rewards such as a drink of water In one important demonstration of the technology the scientists used the internet to connect the brains of two rats separated by thousands of miles one in North Carolina USA and the other in Natal Brazil The researchers were led by Miguel Nicolelis a pioneer of devices that allow paralyzed people to control computers and robotic arms with their thoughts They say their latest work could make it possible for multiple brains to be connected to share information These experiments showed that we have established a sophisticated direct communication connection between brains Nicolelis said Basically we are creating what I call an organic computer The scientists first demonstrated that rats can share and act on each others sensory information by electrically connecting their brains via tiny grids of electrodes that reach the part of the brain that processes movement The rats were taught to press a lever when a light went on above it When they did the task correctly they got a drink of water To test the animals ability to share brain information they put the rats in two separate compartments Only one compartment had a light above the lever When the rat pressed the lever an electronic version of its brain activity was sent directly to the other rats brain In tests the second rat responded correctly to the imported brain signals and pressed the lever 70 of the time Incredibly the communication between the rats was twoway If the receiving rat failed at the task the first rat did not get the reward of a drink and appeared to change its behaviour to make the task easier for its partner In further experiments the rats collaborated on a task that required them to tell the difference between narrow and wide openings using their whiskers In the final test the scientists connected rats on different continents and used the internet to send their brain activity back and forth Even though the animals were on different continents they could still communicate said Miguel PaisVieira the first author of the study This tells us that we could create a workable network of animal brains distributed in many different locations Nicolelis said the team is now working on ways to connect several animals brains at once to solve more complex tasks We cannot even predict what might happen when animals begin interacting as part of a brainnet he said In theory you could imagine that a combination of brains could find solutions that individual brains cannot achieve by themselves Anders Sandberg who studies the ethics of neurotechnologies at Oxford University said the work was very important in helping to understand how brains encode information But the potential future uses of the technology are much wider said Sandberg The main reason we are running the planet is that we are amazingly good at communicating and coordinating Without that although we are very smart animals we would not dominate the planet I dont think theres any risk of supersmart rats from this he added Theres a big difference between sharing sensory information and being able to plan Im not worried about an invasion by smart rats Very little is known about how people encode thoughts and how they might be sent to another persons brain so that will not happen any time soon And much of what is in our minds is a draft as Sandberg calls it of what we might do Often we dont want to reveal those drafts because that would be embarrassing and confusing And we change a lot of those drafts before we act Most of the time I think wed be very thankful not to be in someone elses head,train,ELE,INT
17,The direct action group UK Uncut plans to make many Starbucks cafs into crches refuges and homeless shelters to make people notice that Starbucks does not pay enough tax The House of Commons questioned Starbucks They asked why the company paid no corporation tax in the UK during the past three years UK Uncut wants to show a connection between government cuts especially the cuts that affect women and multinational businesses who do not pay enough tax Sarah Greene a UK Uncut activist said money for refuges would be cut if companies did not pay the fair amount of tax The government lost about 32 billion in 2011 because multinational businesses did not pay enough tax Greene said the government could easily collect billions of pounds that could help pay for important services if they were stricter when they collect taxes UK Uncut turned its attentions to Starbucks after an investigation found that the company had paid only 86 million in corporation tax since opening its cafs in the UK in 1998 despite sales worth 3 billion Uncut campaigner Anna Walker said Weve chosen to highlight the impact of the cuts on women So were going to focus on changing Starbucks into the services that the government are cutting for example refuges and crches Starbucks is a really great target because it is on every high street in the country so people can take action in their local areas she said Starbucks says it pays the correct level of taxes The group Chief Executive Howard Schultz said Starbucks has always paid taxes in the UK Over the last three years alone our company has paid more than 160 million in various taxes including national insurance VAT and business rates Apple eBay Facebook Google and Starbucks have avoided nearly 900 million of tax The Prime Minister David Cameron said Im not happy with the current situation We need to make sure we continue to encourage these businesses to invest in our country but they should pay fair taxes as well A spokeswoman for Starbucks said Tax law can be extremely complex but Starbucks respects tax laws and accounting rules Starbucks spends hundreds of millions of pounds with local suppliers on milk cakes and sandwiches and on store design and improvements When you consider the indirect employment created by Starbucks the companys economic impact to the UK economy is more than 80 million every year,On an average day its outlets host everything from business meetings to reading groups All these people are looking for that important morning coffee But Starbucks should be careful what it wishes for The direct action group UK Uncut plans to turn dozens of the coffee empires UK outlets into crches refuges and homeless shelters to highlight Starbucks tax avoidance tactics They announced the action as Starbucks were questioned by the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee They asked why the company paid no corporation tax in the UK during the past three years despite the companys profitable business in Britain When he appears before the committee Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead will attempt to repair the companys reputation MPs accused the HM Revenue Customs HMRC the UKs tax department of having cosy relationships with big businesses Speaking about the arrangements with Starbucks the Conservative MP Richard Bacon said It smells And it doesnt smell of coffee it smells bad The campaign group UK Uncut wants to show a connection between government cuts in particular those that affect women and tax avoidance by multinational businesses Sarah Greene a UK Uncut activist said funding for refuges and rape crisis centres would be reduced unless companies paid the fair amount of tax HMRC estimates around 32bn was lost due to tax avoidance in 2011 Greene said the government could easily collect billions that could help pay for necessary services if they were stricter on tax avoidance The group which became known because of its protests at Vodafone stores Topshop and Fortnum Mason turned its attentions to Starbucks beause an investigation discovered the company had paid only 86m in corporation tax since launching in the UK in 1998 despite cumulative sales of 3bn Uncut campaigner Anna Walker said Weve chosen to really highlight the impact of the cuts on women So were going to focus on transforming Starbucks into those services that the government are cutting such as refuges and crches Starbucks is a really great target because it is on every high street across the country and thats what UK Uncut finds really important people can take action in their local areas she said Several international organizations have been criticized over their UK accounts Amazon eBay Facebook Google and Ikea all pay little or no corporation tax The coffee store chain Starbucks insists it pays the correct level of taxes The group Chief Executive Howard Schultz has said in a statement Starbucks has always paid taxes in the UK Over the last three years alone our company has paid more than 160m in various taxes including National Insurance VAT and business rates Margaret Hodge who leads the Public Accounts Committee told parliament last month that Apple eBay Facebook Google and Starbucks had avoided nearly 900m of tax The Prime Minister David Cameron responded to the claim by saying Im not happy with the current situation I think HMRC needs to look at it very carefully We do need to make sure we continue to encourage these businesses to invest in our country but they should be paying fair taxes as well A spokeswoman for Starbucks said While the subject of tax law can be extremely complex Starbucks respects and obeys tax laws and accounting rules in each of the 61 countries where we do business including the UK Weve posted the facts about our tax practices in the UK on our website Starbucks economic impact in the UK goes far beyond our stores and partners employees We spend hundreds of millions of pounds with local suppliers on milk cakes and sandwiches and on store design and renovations When you consider the indirect employment created by Starbucks investments in the UK the companys extended economic impact to the UK economy is more

149,It is difficult to know exactly where the noise is coming from but you can hear it everywhere in Damascus All day and all night you can hear the sound of guns rockets or planes attacking rebels the sound of war is getting closer to Syrias capital The Syrian war began two years ago and now the people of Damascus try not to listen to the sound of explosions just a few miles away Actually you get used to it after a while said George who lives in the city But you never know exactly what they are hitting That usually becomes clear later from videos that the opposition puts on YouTube The constant noise of bombs is more worrying because the government tries so hard to pretend that life is normal As you can see everything here is fine but we have to hit the terrorists these extremists an army officer said One government official said If I was afraid I would just shut my door and stay inside I have to work and I am not afraid If I dont defend my country who will In private conversation ordinary people say something different In the centre of town a shopkeeper complained sadly that his baby daughter cries at the sound of explosions Zeina a student worries that she has learnt to live with suffering and danger In the beginning when there started to be explosions I used to have nightmares she said Now I can sleep through anything And the dangers are increasing even closer to home Sabaa Bahrat Square was the safest part of Damascus but recently a car bomb exploded there and damaged the Syrian Central Bank The square is often used for progovernment rallies with people shouting slogans under enormous pictures of President Bashar alAssad That bombing was not the worst one in Damascus in recent months In February reports say that 80 people including schoolchildren died near the ruling Baath Party headquarters in Mazraa You can still see the crater I live nearby but luckily I wasnt there says Munir a university lecturer Rebels who are now very close to the city have recently started to fire mortar bombs The bombs killed 15 students in a university cafeteria on 28 March They probably wanted to hit a government building In July 2012 a bomb killed four of Assads senior aides After that security increased Concrete barriers often painted in the Syrian flags black red and white now protect official buildings not just the military or defence installations that are obvious targets Moving around the city has become difficult and takes a lot of time another part of life today in a nervous city Checkpoints on main roads stop traffic for ID checks and bags are searched for explosives Only drivers with official permission can use special fast lanes to avoid the wait There is one question on everyones mind will there be a battle for Damascus one of the worlds oldest cities like the one that has badly damaged Aleppo One view is that there will be a battle for Syrias capital but not yet in the summer perhaps Others argue that there will probably not be a complete victory for either side and hope for a political solution that comes from abroad But most people here do not expect things to get better,It is hard to tell exactly where the noise is coming from but impossible to miss it from anywhere in Damascus All day and all night you can hear the sound of guns rockets or planes attacking rebel positions the sound of war getting closer to Syrias capital Just over two years after the Syrian crisis began the people of Damascus have learnt to ignore the sound of death and destruction just a few miles away Actually you do get used to it after a while said George an IT technician But you never know exactly what they are hitting That usually becomes clear later from video clips posted by the opposition on YouTube The constant background noise is more worrying because the government tries so hard to keep an atmosphere of business as usual As you can see everything here is fine but we have to hit the terrorists these extremists an army officer announced One government official said If I was afraid I would just shut my door and stay inside I have to work and I am not afraid If I dont defend my country who will In private conversation ordinary people are less defiant In the centre of town a shopkeeper complained sadly that his baby daughter cries at the sound of explosions Zeina a twentysomething student is afraid she might become desensitized to suffering and perhaps to danger too In the beginning when there started to be explosions I used to have nightmares she reflected Now I can sleep through anything And the risks are increasing even closer to home In Sabaa Bahrat Square in what was supposed to be the safest part of Damascus a car bomb exploded leaving the front of a building black its windows broken and also damaging the imposing structure of the Syrian Central Bank next door The square is often used for televised proregime rallies with people chanting slogans under giant banners of President Bashar alAssad That bombing was not the worst Damascus has experienced as the situation has deteriorated In February reports say that 80 people including schoolchildren died near the ruling Baath Party headquarters in Mazraa You can still see the crater marked by an enormous patch of fresh asphalt on the main road going north I live nearby but luckily I wasnt there recalled Munir a university lecturer Mortar bombs fired from rebelheld areas now very close to the city have become a worrying new development The bombs killed 15 students in a university cafeteria on 28 March The intended target was probably a government building There has been increased security since the bombing of the national security crisis cell in July 2012 when four of Assads most senior aides were killed Concrete blast barriers often painted in the Syrian flags black red and white now protect official buildings not just the military or defence installations that are obvious targets The Iranian Embassy in Mezze now looks like a fortress The regime did manage to set up a ring of steel round Damascus a foreign diplomat said He added that there are now holes in that ring of steel and that brings home the reality of the war All this means that moving around has become difficult unpredictable and timeconsuming another part of life today in an understandably nervous city Checkpoints on

avoid the wait It is hard however to avoid the question on everyones mind will there be a battle for Damascus the worlds oldest continually inhabited city as the guidebooks say like the one that has so damaged Aleppo Parts of the city already feel like a war zone its most exclusive and expensive hotel is almost empty although many rooms are being used as offices by international agencies with white UN vehicles parked behind the blast barriers outside The streets empty soon after 9pm One view is that the fight for Syrias capital is coming but not quite yet in the summer perhaps some predict when the rebels have made further progress in the south Others argue that a complete victory by either side is unlikely and hope for a political solution that comes from abroad But few people here

174,A big international disagreement has 1 started over the right of Bolivias indigenous Indian tribes to chew coca leaves the main ingredient in cocaine This could have a significant effect on global drugs policy Bolivia has received a special exemption from the 1961 Convention on Drugs the agreement that controls international drugs policy The exemption allows Bolivias indigenous people to chew the leaves Bolivia said that the convention was against 2 its new constitution which says it must protect native and ancestral coca as part of its cultural heritage and says that coca in its natural state is not a dangerous drug South American Indians have chewed coca 3 leaves for hundreds of years The leaves give energy and have medicinal qualities People who support Bolivias position said that defending the rights of indigenous people was the right thing to do The Bolivian move is very important said Danny Kushlick of the Transform Drug Policy Foundation It shows that any country that doesnt want to continue the war on drugs can change its relations with the UN conventions But the UNs International Narcotics 4 Control Board INCB which checks global drug agreements says Bolivia may harm international drug controls Many countries including the UK the US Italy Sweden the Netherlands and Russia do not want to give Bolivia what it is asking for The UK told the UN that it respects the 5 cultural importance of the coca leaf in Bolivia but it adds The United Kingdom is worried that the exemption could lead to more coca production and most importantly more coca reaching the cocaine trade The exemption would make it more difficult to control the illegal drugs trade The right of indigenous people in South 6 Americas Andean region to chew coca leaf was removed in 1964 when Bolivia was under a dictatorship and it signed the convention In 2011 Bolivia told the UN that it did not 7 want to be part of the convention any more It is now part of the convention again but with an exemption so that its indigenous people can continue chewing coca leaves The exemption is the first in the history of 8 UN drugcontrol agreements It has led to worries that other countries may also ask for exemptions The Russian government says that the exemption will lead to more illegal cocaine and warns that it also sets a dangerous example that could be used by other states in creating a more liberal drugcontrol regime The British parliament has recommended 9 that the UK government should support Bolivias request It says that it is important that countries stay in the convention Bolivias return could be blocked only if a third or more of the 184 countries that have signed the convention opposed the exemption Some people believe that the US and UK are telling other countries that they should block Bolivias request Nancie Prudhomme of the International 10 Centre on Human Rights and Drug Policy said people are wrong to oppose Bolivias request These objections are not completely legal she said She added that all over the world it has become normal to support cultural and indigenous rights so we should support Bolivias efforts The decision to ban coca chewing was 11 based on a 1950 report Some people say the report did not use any evidence It is legal to grow coca leaves in Bolivia As a result cocaine production has decreased in the country and some experts see Bolivia as a model for other countries,The right of Bolivias indigenous Indian tribes to 1 chew coca leaves the main ingredient in cocaine has caused major international disagreement which could have a significant effect on global drugs policy Bolivia has received a special exemption from the 1961 Convention on Narcotic Drugs which controls international drugs policy The exemption allows Bolivias indigenous people to chew the leaves Bolivia had argued that the convention was in 2 opposition to its new constitution adopted in 2009 which says it must protect native and ancestral coca as part of its cultural heritage and maintains that coca in its natural state is not a narcotic South American Indians have chewed coca 3 leaves for centuries The leaves are said to provide energy and have medicinal qualities Supporters of Bolivias position said that defending the rights of indigenous people was the right thing to do The Bolivian move is inspirational and groundbreaking said Danny Kushlick of the Transform Drug Policy Foundation which supports drug liberalization It shows that any country that is fed up with the war on drugs can change its relations with the UN conventions However the UNs International Narcotics Control 4 Board INCB which checks implementation of global drug treaties says that Bolivia is threatening international drug controls A number of countries including the UK the US Italy Sweden the Netherlands and Russia opposed Bolivias demands The UK told the UN that it respects the cultural 5 importance of the coca leaf in Bolivia but it adds The United Kingdom is worried that the exemption could lead to increases in coca production and most importantly the amount of coca that goes into the cocaine trade As a result the exemption would weaken the global effort to tackle the drugs trade The right of indigenous people in South Americas 6 Andean region to chew coca leaf was removed in 1964 when Bolivia was under a dictatorship and it signed up to the convention But Bolivia was given 25 years to implement the ban This arrangement came to an end in 1989 and since then the issue has been under dispute In 2011 Bolivia whose President Evo Morales 7 is a former coca producer formally told the UN that it did not want to be in the convention any more It has now signed up to the convention again but with an exemption so that its indigenous people can continue chewing coca leaves The exemption is the first of its kind in the 8 history of UN drugcontrol treaties and has led to concerns that other countries may apply for exemptions The Russian government has argued that the exemption will lead to an increase in illegal circulation of cocaine and warned that it also sets a dangerous precedent that could be used by other states in creating a more liberal drugcontrol regime The British parliament has recommended that 9 Bolivias request should be supported by the UK government It argues that it is important that countries stay in the convention Bolivias return could be blocked only if a third or more of the 184 countries that have signed up to the convention opposed its request There are suspicions that the US and UK are trying to persuade other countries to block Bolivias request Nancie Prudhomme of the International Centre 10 on Human Rights and Drug Policy criticized the coordinated opposition to Bolivias demands These objections are legally questionable she said They support an arbitrary and overbroad provision and apply international drug laws in a vacuum This is not right No state has paid any attention to decades of developing international norms on cultural and indigenous rights which support Bolivias efforts The decision to ban coca chewing was based on 11 a 1950 report produced by the UN Commission of Inquiry on the Coca Leaf which supporters of drug liberalization say was not based on evidence The growing of coca leaves is legal and licensed in Bolivia Some believe this has led to a fall in cocaine production in the country For this reason some experts see Bolivia as a model for other countries,train,ELE,INT

good quality What this person does Opens tins of dog or cat food smells it and eats it Tasting is an important quality check to make sure each different ingredient is perfectly balanced says Philip Wells the chief taster for Lilys Kitchen pet food Typical salary 20000 for a job in the quality department Worst part of the job The deadlines Wells says he likes the food The meat in pet food must come from animals that humans can safely eat He also says There are some terrible pet foods I dont taste them but just the smell makes you feel sick Job satisfaction Every day is different Wells likes knowing that he helps pets to become happier and healthier But he says that someone else in the tasting team is also a very important member Lily the dog 2 Hygiene technician The job To clean areas that might be dangerous to humans What this person does Cleans up crime scenes road accidents and suicides Clears houses full of rubbish rats and excrement and other things too The job is to keep people safe says Richard Lewis a hygiene technician for Rentokil We work in some very very dirty places Typical salary When you start the salary is usually around 14500 A top salary can be up to 22000 Worst part of the job Cleaning up after suicides You get used to the job being disgusting But the emotional side of the job is still hard he says You also need to have a sense of humour because some days can be difficult Job satisfaction Lewis finds the variety of tasks exciting One day Im cleaning up after a dead body another day Im in a prison cell Its satisfying to make a dangerous place safe again he says 3 Biogas engineer The job To set up biogas plants in developing countries What this person does Helps poor people produce biogas from their excrement and other waste products This is done by linking a system to toilets Poor people can use the gas for cooking and lighting Typical salary When you start the salary is around 10000 A typical salary for a chief technical officer is 30000 Worst part of the job For Baburam Paudel chief technical officer in Nepal for the charity Renewable World the worst part is seeing people struggling to survive on very little money Unsurprisingly the smell of the waste products can be disgusting It smells like rotten eggs Job satisfaction I find it very satisfying to know that I am helping people to earn more money and also allowing girls to go to school because they dont need to collect firewood says Paudel My work improves the health and hygiene of whole communities 4 Eel ecologist The job To help the critically endangered European eel to survive What this person does Checks the size of the endangered eels They do this by walking into the Thames and other London rivers which are full of eels In the rivers they put their hands into a net filled with up to 20 adult eels and pull an eel out Adult eels can be a metre long or even larger and weigh up to 2kg Theyre not dangerous but they are almost 100 muscle and they can be a little bit slimy says Stephen Mowat an eel ecologist for the Zoological Society of London We have to weigh and measure them and they wriggle a lot I look silly when Im crawling on the ground chasing an eel across the grass Worst part of the job Eels are really difficult animals to work with says Mowat But for Mowat the worst part o f the job is not the eels he believes baby eels are as cute as pandas The worst thing about the job is seeing how much damage humans do to the environment Job satisfaction Working outside and seeing British wildlife really close is the best part of the job says Mowat Eels are beautiful animals and working with eels helps whole river systems That is a great thing to do 5 Shopping channel presenter The job To sell and demonstrate lots of different products on live TV What this person does Presents hours and hours of boring TV and at the same time demonstrates the products and looks enthusiastic about everything

sometimes I have to start work at five in the morning Job satisfaction I love presenting live TV and having to think quickly says Ryan I also love knowing that at times thousands of people are buying the product that I have just presented,We asked five people who do some unusual jobs how much they are paid what the worst parts are and why they enjoy their work 1 Dogfood taster The job Tasting dog food to make sure it meets a top brands quality standards What it involves Opening sample tins of each batch of dog or cat food smelling it and eating it Although dogs sense of taste is different from ours tasting is an important quality check to ensure each different ingredient is perfectly balanced in just the right way says Philip Wells the chief taster for Lilys Kitchen pet food Typical salary 20000 for an entrylevel job in the quality department However Wells says an experienced technical director can easily earn 50000 or more Worst part of the job The deadlines for Wells who admits he quite likes the food The meat used in pet food has to come from animals that are fit for human consumption under the Animal Feed Regulations 2010 He adds There are some pretty terrible pet foods out there and although I dont taste them the smell is enough to turn the stomach Job satisfaction No two days are ever the same Wells finds it rewarding that a project he has worked on will help pets to become happier and healthier However he acknowledges that some of the credit must go to another key member of the tasting team Lily the border terrier 2 Hygiene technician The job Disinfecting areas that might have been exposed to biohazardous situations What it involves Cleaning up crime scenes road accidents and suicides Clearing houses full of rubbish rats and excrement among other things The job is about keeping people safe says Richard Lewis a hygiene technician for Rentokil We deal with some extremely dirty sites Typical salary The entrylevel salary is usually around 14500 and a top salary can be up to 22000 Worst part of the job Cleaning up after suicides You get used to the job being disgusting but the emotional side of it is still hard he says You also need to have a sense of

plants in developing countries What it involves Linking a system which can be filled with human excrement animal dung and other waste products to toilets to produce a biogas that can be used for cooking and lighting You have to know what size and shape the mixing pit needs to be how to create the best temperature for the process and where to build the biogas plant says Baburam Paudel chief technical officer in Nepal for the charity Renewable World Typical salary An entrylevel salary is around 10000 while a typical salary for a chief technical officer is 30000 Worst part of the job For Paudel its seeing people struggling to survive on very little income You have to be willing to get your hands dirty during the build process and inspections Unsurprisingly the anaerobic digestion the process that takes place when bacteria eat the waste and produce methane smells like rotten eggs It can be disgusting and there is no room for mistakes Job satisfaction I find it very satisfying to know that I am helping people to increase their incomes and allowing girls to go to school by replacing the need to collect firewood says Paudel My work improves the health and hygiene of whole communities 4 Eel ecologist The job Conserving the critically endangered European eel What it involves To monitor the size of the endangered eels ecologists walk into the Thames and other London rivers full of eels sometimes up to their armpits and reach into a net filled with up to 20 adult eels to take one out with their bare hands Adult eels can be a metre long or even larger and weigh up

67,We all know about wildlife emergencies such as the possible extinction of the tiger in India the orangutan in Indonesia and the panda Everybody loves these animals and no one wants to see them disappear But now scientists are worried that the threat to creatures such as ladybirds is a much greater danger to biodiversity Climate change falling numbers of animals rising numbers of humans and extinction mean that more and more scientists now believe that we are in the Anthropocene age the age of extinction A recent report from the World Wildlife Fund WWF confirms that worrying idea statistics from the report show a very big reduction in the numbers of many species The number of vertebrates has declined by 52 over the last forty years We are losing too many species Some populations of mammals birds reptiles and amphibians have reduced even more with freshwater species declining by 76 over the same period But its the creatures that help us the most that are worrying many scientists Three quarters of the worlds food production depends on bees and other insects Pandas are cute and tigers are beautiful but other animals are more useful its worms that turn our waste into nutrients and bats that catch mosquitoes and keep malaria rates down Its the loss of the common species that will affect people The loss of the rarer creatures will not affect us much because were not reliant on them in such an obvious way said Dr Nick Isaac who studies the environment He says that Britains insects and other invertebrates are declining just as fast as vertebrates He says that this will cause serious problems for humans He said that between 23 and 36 of all birds mammals and amphibians that we use for food or medicine might become extinct In many parts of the world wild animals are an important part of the diet particularly for the poor Most people also blame humans humans damage ecosystems create climate change and destroy habitats But this time its not just the big cuddly mammals we have to worry about losing but the smaller creatures that are less easy to see We depend on insects creepycrawlies and even worms They might not become extinct very soon but a decline in their numbers will affect us all We are going to feel the effect of those losses The numbers of both invertebrates and vertebrates are declining Its not so simple as fish die and people starve its more complex said Isaac Humans said TV naturalist Sir David Attenborough in 2013 are a plague on earth But the WWF claims there is still time to stop the decline Its UK Chief Executive David Nussbaum said The amount of destruction shown in this report should make us all change our behaviour We all politicians business and people have a responsibility to protect what we all value a healthy future for people and nature Humans are cutting down too many trees too quickly fishing too many fish taking too much water from our rivers and producing too much carbon he said,We have all become familiar with wildlife emergencies such as the threatened extinction of the tiger in India the orangutan in Indonesia and the panda They are wellloved animals that no one wants to see disappear But now scientists fear the real impact of declining wildlife could be closer to home they believe the threat to creatures such as ladybirds is a much greater danger to biodiversity Climate change falling numbers of animals rising numbers of humans and the rapid rate of species extinction mean more and more scientists now believe that we are in the Anthropocene age the geological age of extinction when humans finally dominate the ecosystems A recent report by the World Wildlife Fund WWF confirmed that worrying picture with statistics on the worlds wildlife population that showed a dramatic reduction in numbers across numerous species The report showed the number of vertebrates had declined by 52 over four decades Biodiversity loss has now reached critical levels Some populations of mammals birds reptiles and amphibians have suffered even bigger losses with freshwater species declining by 76 over the same period But its the creatures that provide the most ecosystem services that are getting many scientists really worried Three quarters of the worlds food production is thought to depend on bees and other pollinators Pandas may be cute and tigers beautiful but its worms that turn our waste into nutrients and bats that catch mosquitoes and keep malaria rates down Its the loss of the common species that will impact on people not so much the rarer creatures because they are so rare were not reliant on them in such an obvious way said macroecologist Dr Nick Isaac He says that recent work he and colleagues have been doing suggests that Britains insects and other invertebrates are declining just as fast as vertebrates with serious consequences for humanity The really interesting thing about this work is that we are learning that its not just about the numbers of species going extinct but the actual numbers in a population thats the beginning of a fundamental shift in our understanding he says He pointed to the fact that between 23 and 36 of all birds mammals and amphibians used for food or medicine are now threatened with extinction In many parts of the world wildanimal food sources are a critical part of the diet particularly for the poor The blame most people agree is unsustainable human consumption damaging ecosystems creating climate change and destroying habitats at a far faster rate than previously thought But this time its not just the big cuddly mammals we have to worry about losing but the smaller less visible creatures upon which we depend insects creepycrawlies and even worms They might not be facing immediate extinction but a decline in their numbers will affect us all We are going to feel the impact of those losses With the UK species the pattern is much the same with invertebrates as it is with vertebrates Its not as simplistic as fish die and people starve its more complex said Isaac Humans said TV naturalist Sir David Attenborough in 2013 are a plague on earth but the WWF claims there is still time to stop the decline Its UK Chief Executive David Nussbaum said The scale of the destruction highlighted in this report should act as a wakeup call for us all We all politicians business and people have an interest and a responsibility to protect what we all value a healthy future for people and nature Humans are cutting down trees more quickly than they can regrow harvesting more fish than the oceans can restock pumping water from our rivers and aquifers faster than rainfall can fill them again and emitting more carbon than the oceans and forests can absorb he said,train,ELE,INT
106,Scientists have taken DNA from the tooth of a European huntergatherer and have found out what modern humans looked like before they started farming The Mesolithic man who lived in Spain about 7000 years ago had an unusual mix of blue eyes black or brown hair and dark skin He was probably lactose intolerant and could not digest starchy foods easily The invention of farming brought humans and animals much closer and humans probably developed stronger immune systems to fight infections from the animals But the change to humans immue systems may not be as big as scientists thought tests on the huntergatherers DNA found that he already had genes that made his immune system strong Some of these genes still exist in modern Europeans today Before we started this work I had some ideas of what we were going to find said Carles LaluezaFox who led the study at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona Most of those ideas turned out to be completely wrong The Spanish team started their work after a group of cave explorers found two skeletons in a deep cave high up in the Cantabrian Mountains of northwest Spain in 2006 The skeletons which belonged to two men in their early 30s had been very well preserved in the cool cave Carbon dating showed the skeletons are around 7000 years old from the time before farming arrived in Europe from the Middle East Other things were found in the cave including reindeer teeth that were hung from the peoples clothing The DNA brought some surprises When LaluezaFox looked at it he found that the man had genes for dark skin This guy was darker than any modern European but we dont know how dark the scientist said Another surprise was that the man had blue eyes The results suggest that blue eyes came first in Europe and that the change to lighter skin happened later in Mesolithic times This discovery is important for science It is also important to artists who will have to draw Mesolithic people in a new way You see a lot of pictures of these people hunting and gathering and they look like modern Europeans with light skin You never see a picture of a Mesolithic huntergatherer with dark skin and blue eyes LaluezaFox said The Spanish team compared the huntergatherer to modern Europeans from different regions to see how they might be related They found that the ancient DNA was most closely related to the DNA of people living in northern Europe in particular Sweden and Finland,DNA taken from the wisdom tooth of a European huntergatherer has given scientists a glimpse of modern humans before the rise of farming The Mesolithic man who lived in Spain around 7000 years ago had an unusual mix of blue eyes black or brown hair and dark skin according to analyses of his genetic makeup He was probably lactose intolerant and had more difficulty digesting starchy foods than the farmers whose diets and lifestyles changed in the first agricultural revolution The invention of farming brought humans and animals into much closer contact and humans probably evolved stronger immune systems to fight infections from the animals But scientists may have overestimated the impact farming had on the human immune system because tests on the huntergatherers DNA found that he already carried genes that boost the immune system Some of these gene mutations still exist in modern Europeans today Before we started this work I had some ideas of what we were going to find said Carles LaluezaFox who led the study at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona Most of those ideas turned out to be completely wrong The Spanish team started their work after a group of cave explorers found two skeletons in a deep and complex cave system high up in the Cantabrian Mountains of northwest Spain in 2006 The human remains which belonged to two men in their early 30s had been extremely well preserved by the cool environment of the cave Carbon dating put the remains at around 7000 years old before farming arrived in Europe from the Middle East Other things were found at the site including reindeer teeth that were strung and hung from the peoples clothing The scientists managed to put together one mans entire genome from DNA found in the root of a third molar It is the first time researchers have got the complete genome of a modern European who lived before the Neolithic revolution The DNA brought some surprises When LaluezaFox looked at the genome he found that the man had gene variants that produce dark skin This guy had to be darker than any modern European but we dont know how dark the scientist said Another surprise was that the man had blue eyes The results suggest that blue eye colour came first in Europe and that the change to lighter skin happened throughout Mesolithic times On top of the scientific impact artists might have to rethink their drawings of the people You see a lot of reconstructions of these people hunting and gathering and they look like modern Europeans with light skin You never see a reconstruction of a Mesolithic huntergatherer with dark skin and blue eyes LaluezaFox said The Spanish team compared the genome of the huntergatherer to those of modern Europeans from different regions to see how they might be related They found that the ancient DNA most closely matched the genetic makeup of people living in northern Europe in particular Sweden and Finland Martin Jones professor of archaeological science at Cambridge University said the immunity genes were the most interesting result There has been the idea that the move from a huntergatherer lifestyle to farming was bad for our health There were a number of reasons for that particularly living closely together with other humans and animals which meant they competed for the same water supplies he

148,There are about 50000 mystery shopping trips every month in the UK Mystery shoppers pretend to be a customer in a store but they are really collecting information on the store and how good or bad its service is The demand for mystery shoppers is growing because online shopping is becoming more popular Retailers are becoming increasingly aware that shoppers who visit a physical store want a service and an experience they cant get online says Simon Boydell spokesman for Marketforce which has more than 300000 mystery shoppers Our clients want to know how well their stores are delivering on that experience We assign different store locations to each shopper and rotate them so that they never go back to the same shop within three months says Jill Spencer of mystery shopping company ABa Each day they spend up to eight hours visiting ve to ten stores plus another hour or two writing detailed reports on every part of their visit For that the mystery shoppers can earn up to 155 a day Their expenses are also paid Mystery shoppers who lm their visits with a hidden camera can earn even more around 300 a day Mystery shoppers are usually repaid any money they spend in the stores and may also be allowed to keep the products they buy They usually give me between 5 and 20 to spend at each store to check the service I receive at the till says mystery shopper Laura Im always given a speci c task such as buying something from a speci c department or a new product range but I can often buy whatever I want and keep it Like most fulltime mystery shoppers Laura is selfemployed She earns around 30000 to 40000 a year and that doesnt include all the freebies she gets on the job With Macmillan Publishers Ltd 2014 NEWS LESSONS The secrets of the mystery shopper Elementary the perks its enough to live on She nds it satisfying to return to a store where she has previously been a mystery shopper and see standards have improved I know it must be because of my feedback or why would they pay me to give it I feel Im not just doing a service for my company Im doing a service for all shoppers everywhere More than 500000 people have registered as mystery shoppers in the UK but just 10 or less get regular work each month This has led to a dramatic reduction in payment Before people were paid and got travel expenses but now you often just receive some money towards a purchase say Val a 51yearold former mystery shopper Nowadays mystery shopping companies mostly give freebies as an incentive Marketforce shoppers usually get a couple of pounds for a visit for their time and effort says Boydell At the most well pay 15 to 25 plus expenses for a meal for two or a hotel stay for example We dont directly employ any shoppers so we dont have to pay them the minimum wage Id go on a cruise for nothing says Laura But I think mystery shopping companies that pay you a nominal fee to travel to a restaurant and eat a meal are exploiting people I wont do those jobs anymore But there are plenty of people who want to do those jobs Hannah a 41yearold lawyer has made nearly 500 visits for the Mystery Dining Company in her spare time without receiving pay or travel expenses She has enjoyed 200 meals at Michelin starred restaurants and overnight stays at expensive hotels But it can be hard work Hannah says she spends two to four hours after each visit writing detailed reports on everything from the quality of the food to speci c conversations with staff And she always needs to be able to name or describe the staff She has to memorize all these details while eating her meal because she cannot openly write anything down,The customer next to you in the queue looks quite normal But instead of a shopping list you notice shes carrying handwritten notes about the appearance and cleanliness of the store Shes been timing the speed of the queue on her phone and is that a tiny camera lens in her purse Shes probably a mystery shopper There are approximately 50000 mystery shopping trips carried out every month in the UK according to the Mystery Shopping Providers Association and as more and more spending takes place online the demand for mystery shoppers is growing Retailers are becoming increasingly aware that shoppers who are prepared to set foot in a physical store want a service and an experience they cant get online says Simon Boydell spokesman for

rotate them so that they never go back to the same shop within three months says Jill Spencer of mystery shopping company ABa Each day they typically spend up to eight hours visiting ve to ten stores plus another hour or two ling detailed reports on every aspect of their visit For that the mystery shoppers can earn up to 155 a day They are also reimbursed for their expenses Mystery shoppers who lm their visits with a hidden camera can earn even more around 300 a day Shoppers are usually repaid any money they spend in the stores and may also be allowed to keep the products they buy Im typically given between 5 and 20 to spend at each store to assess the service I receive at the till says mystery shopper Laura Im always given a scenario such as buying something from a speci c department or a new product range but I can often buy whatever I want and keep it Like most fulltime mystery shoppers Laura is selfemployed Her income is around 30000 to 40000 a year and that doesnt include all the freebies she gets on the job With the perks its enough to live on She nds it satisfying to return to a store she has previously mystery shopped and see standards have improved I know it must be because of my feedback or why would they pay me to give it Some of the retailers I shop at win awards for customer service and I think that is down to us mystery shoppers I feel Im not just doing a service for my company Im doing a service for all shoppers everywhere Its estimated that more than 500000 people have registered as mystery shoppers in the UK but just 10 or less manage to get regular work each month This has led to a dramatic reduction in pay Once you got a fee reimbursement for your purchase and mileage but you now often just receive a contribution towards a purchase say Val a 51yearold former mystery shopper I worked for 40 different mystery shopping companies for almost 20 years but I gave up entirely three years ago because I had bills to pay and very few assignments paid an acceptable rate Nowadays mystery shopping companies mostly give freebies to incentivize their workers Marketforce shoppers typically get a couple of pounds for a visit as a token gesture for their time and effort says Boydell At the most well pay 15 to 25 plus reimbursement for perhaps a meal for two or a hotel stay We dont directly employ any shoppers so we dont have to pay them the minimum wage Id go on a cruise for nothing says Laura But I think mystery shopping companies that pay you a nominal fee to travel to a restaurant and eat a meal are exploiting people I wont touch those jobs anymore There are plenty of people however that would Hannah a 41yearold lawyer has done nearly 500 visits for the Mystery Dining Company in her spare time without receiving 9 3 pay or travel expenses She carries out their most exclusive assignments enjoying 200 meals at Michelinstarred restaurants and overnight stays at boutique hotels But theres no such thing as a free lunch even if you work for a mystery dining company Hannah says she typically spends two to four hours after each visit writing detailed reports on everything from the quality of the food to speci c interactions with staff whom she always needs to be able to name or describe She has to memorize all these details while eating her meal because she cannot openly write anything down Theres lots to remember Youre expected to give feedback while its fresh so Ive had to get up at 5am to write a report before work Its a challenging thing to do you need to be focused articulate and detail orientated,train,ELE,INT
21,The Moroccan city of Ouarzazate is on the edge of the Sahara Desert It is now the centre for four linked solar megaplants The plants together with hydro and wind will give Morocco in north Africa nearly half of its electricity from renewable energy by 2020 The project is a key part of Moroccos plans to use its deserts to become a global solar superpower When the full complex is complete it will be the largest concentrated solar power plant in the world The rst phase called Noor 1 will be ready in November 2015 The mirror technology it uses is more expensive than the solar panels that we can see on roofs all over the world but it will be able to produce power even after the sun goes down People have known for many years that the desert is a useful place to produce solar energy In 1986 the German scientist Gerhard Knies said that the worlds deserts receive enough energy in a few hours to make power for all the people in the world for a whole year But the challenge is to capture that energy and take it to where it is needed At Noor 1 there are 500000 moonshaped solar mirrors The 800 rows of mirrors follow the sun across the sky They whir quietly every few minutes When they are nished the four plants at Ouarzazate will be as big as Moroccos capital city Rabat and make 580 megawatts of electricity enough for a million homes Solar energy will make up a third of Moroccos renewable energy supply by 2020 Wind and hydro will make up the other twothirds We are very proud of this project Moroccos environment minister Hakima elHaite said I think it is the most important solar plant in the world The Noor 2 and 3 plants which are planned to open in 2017 will store energy for up to eight hours This will mean that there could be solar energy available 247 in the Sahara and the rest of the region We are already involved in transportation lines to take energy to the south of Morocco and Mauritania says Ahmed Baroudi manager of the national renewable energy investment company But he says the project will go further even as far as the Middle East Exporting solar energy could have stabilizing effects within and between countries according to the Moroccan solar energy agency Masen Morocco is making plans with Tunisia and they hope to export energy north across the Mediterranean too We believe that its possible to export energy to Europe but rst we have to build the connections which dont yet exist said Maha elKadiri a Masen spokeswoman Until that time the solar energy will be used in Morocco They might one day use solar energy to remove salt from sea water,The Moroccan city of Ouarzazate is used to big productions It is on the edge of the Sahara Desert and at the centre of the North African countrys Ouallywood lm industry where scenes from movies such as Lawrence of Arabia The Mummy The Living Daylights and even Game of Thrones were lmed Now the city known as the door of the desert is the centre for a complex of four linked solar mega plants which together with hydro and wind will help provide nearly half of Moroccos electricity from renewable energy by 2020 The project is a key part of Moroccos ambitions to use its deserts to become a global solar superpower When the full complex is complete it will be the largest concentrated solar power plant in the world The rst phase called Noor 1 will be ready in November 2015 The mirror technology it uses is less widespread and more expensive than the photovoltaic panels that you can see on roofs all over the world But it will have the advantage of being able to continue producing power even after the sun goes down The potential for solar power from the desert has been known for decades In the days after the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986 the German particle physicist Gerhard Knies calculated that the worlds deserts receive enough energy in a few hours to provide power for all the people in the world for a whole year But the challenge is to capture that energy and take it to where it is needed As engineers nish Noor 1 its 500000 moonshaped solar mirrors glitter in the desert The 800 rows follow the sun across the sky whirring quietly every few minutes When they are nished the four plants at Ouarzazate will need a space as big as Moroccos capital city Rabat and generate 580 megawatts of electricity enough to power a million homes Moroccos environment minister Hakima elHaite believes that solar energy could have the same effects on the region this century that oil production had in the last century But the 9bn project was triggered by more immediate concerns she said We import 94 of our energy as fossil fuels from other countries and that has big consequences for our state budget elHaite told the Guardian So when we heard about the possibilities of solar energy we thought Why not Solar energy will make up a third of Moroccos renewable energy supply by 2020 Wind and hydro will make up the other twothirds We are very proud of this project elHaite said I think it is the most important solar plant in the world Technicians say that the Noor 2 and 3 plants due to open in 2017 will store energy for up to eight hours this gives the possibility of 247 solar energy in the Sahara and the surrounding region The rst part of the project is nearly completed and Morocco has bigger international ambitions We are already involved in transportation lines to cover the full south of Morocco and Mauritania says Ahmed Baroudi manager of Societe dInvestissements Energetiques the national renewable energy investment rm But he says the projects effects will go further even as far as the Middle East Exporting solar energy could have stabilizing effects within and between countries according to the Moroccan solar energy agency Masen Morocco is making plans with Tunisia and energy exports northwards across the Mediterranean are a key goal We believe that its possible to export energy to Europe but rst we have to build the interconnectors which dont yet exist said Maha elKadiri a Masen spokeswoman In the meantime Morocco is focused on using solar to meet its own needs This could one day include water desalination which is very useful in a country that is having more and more droughts as the climate warms About 9bn has been invested in the Noor Complex much of it from international institutions such as the European Investment Bank and World Bank and supported by Moroccan government guarantees Energy subsidies from Moroccos King Mohammed VI have stopped the cost from being transferred to normal people Over a thousand mostly Moroccan workers are still racing to x electric wires take down scaffolding and insulate steel pipelines They hurry past in yellow and orange safety vests working 12hour shifts beneath the Atlas mountains They wear hard hats safety shoes and ear plugs Weve done the construction and now we will see how these projects look when they start says Hajar Lakhael a 25yearold environment and security manager from

92,At Addis Ababa airport visitors see pictures of golden grains tiny red seeds and a group of men around a giant pancake The words say Teff the best glutenfree crop Ethiopia is one of the worlds poorest countries well known for its difficult food situation But it is also the home of teff a highly nutritious grain that you can now buy in healthfood shops and supermarkets in Europe and America Teffs tiny seeds the size of poppy seeds are high in calcium iron and protein and also amino acids You can use the glutenfree grain instead of wheat flour in anything from bread and pasta to waffles and pizza bases In Ethiopia teff is a national obsession It is grown by about 63 million farmers fields of the crop cover more than 20 of all farmland They make it into flour and use it to make injera the flatbread that is basic to Ethiopian cooking The grain is also important in many religious and cultural ceremonies Across the country people meet around large pieces of injera They use it to scoop up stews and to feed one another as a sign of loyalty or friendship a tradition known as gursha Teff is now called Ethiopias second gift to the world after coffee Ethiopias growing middle class want more teff This has increased the price of teff so it is now too expensive for the poorest people Today most small farmers sell most of what they grow to people in Ethiopian cities Teff is the most nutritionally valuable grain in the country In urban areas people eat up to 61kg of teff a year In rural areas they eat 20kg The type of teff people eat is different too the rich eat the more expensive magna and white teff poorer people usually eat lessvaluable red and mixed teff They also mix it with cheaper cereals such as sorghum and maize The Ethiopian government wants to double teff production by 2015 It says that the grain could play an important role in school meals and emergency aid programmes and help reduce malnutrition particularly among children In Ethiopia around 20 of children under five are malnourished The government does not allow the export of raw teff grain only of injera and other processed products But this could change the goal is to produce enough teff for Ethiopia and for export Mama Fresh is a family company that sells injera to top restaurants and hotels in the Ethiopian capital It also exports the flatbread to Finland Germany Sweden and the US mostly for Ethiopians who live there But the company wants to double exports to America in 2014 and will soon start producing teffbased pizzas bread and cookies Regassa Feyissa an Ethiopian agricultural scientist says that without careful planning growing more teff for export may mean that farmers do not grow other important crops There is not much Ethiopian teff on the international market so farmers in the US have started planting the crop Farmers in Europe Israel and Australia have also experimented with growing it,At Addis Ababa airport visitors are greeted by pictures of golden grains tiny red seeds and a group of men around a giant pancake The words say Teff the ultimate glutenfree crop Ethiopia is one of the worlds poorest countries well known for its difficult food

Across the country and in neighbouring Eritrea people gather around large pieces of injera which is also used as cutlery scooping up stews and feeding one another as a sign of loyalty or friendship a tradition known as gursha The growing appetite for traditional crops and the booming healthfood and glutenfree markets are breathing new life into the grain which is increasingly being called Ethiopias second gift to the world after coffee Sophie Kebede a Londonbased businesswoman who owns a UK company specializing in the grain says she was flabbergasted when she discovered its nutritional value I didnt know it was so sought after I am of Ethiopian origin Ive been eating injera all my life Growing demand for socalled ancient grains has not always been a simple positive for poor communities In Bolivia and Peru there are reports of rising incomes from the nowglobal quinoa trade but also malnutrition and conflicts over land as farmers sell their entire crop to meet western demand Ethiopias growing middle class is also increasing demand for teff and rising prices have made the grain too expensive for the poorest people Today most small farmers sell most of what they grow to people in the city This may have helped boost incomes in some rural areas but it has had nutritional consequences says the government as teff is the most nutritionally valuable grain in the country In urban areas people eat up to 61kg of teff a year In rural areas the figure is 20kg The type of teff people eat is different too the rich eat the more expensive magna and white teff varieties poorer people usually eat lessvaluable red and mixed teff and more than half combine it with cheaper cereals such as sorghum and maize The Ethiopian government wants to double teff production by 2015 It says that the grain could play an important role in school meals and emergency aid programmes and help reduce malnutrition particularly among children and adolescents Though Ethiopia has a fastgrowing economy it remains on the UNs list of leastdeveloped countries An estimated 20 of underfives are malnourished The governments Agricultural Transformation Agency aims to boost crops by developing improved varieties of the grain and introducing new planting techniques and tools The government does not allow the export of raw teff grain only of injera and other processed products But this could

29yearold electrical engineer is one of many refugees who live in the jungle camp outside Calais who have applied for asylum in France They want to learn the language of their new home I want people in the UK to know that not everyone wants to go there There are a lot of people here who want to stay in France Kamal said France already has more than a quarter of a million refugees There are also 56000 asylum seekers who are waiting to see if they can stay in France While they wait for an answer France does not give them any money or allow them to work The wait can take many months The jungle camp offers a free meal a day and a plastic roof over their heads So many people decide to live there and not work illegally because then they will not be allowed to stay in France Some of the asylum seekers suggested the idea for the school at the start of the summer They were bored with waiting and nervous about starting a new life in France totally unable to communicate The school opened on 11 July We did it so people can learn French said Zimarco Jones the schools Nigerian founder He arrived in Calais in 2013 and is still waiting to hear if he will be allowed to stay in France Now we need to build another school he says with a grin The tiny classroom can hold 30 pupils There are five rows of desks in front of a big green chalkboard and pictures of cartoon animals for each letter of the French alphabet There are also classes in English art and tai chi But the French lessons are the most popular The teachers are volunteers from Calais and other places French is not as easy as English but two weeks ago I decided there was no way to get to the UK says George another refugee and student He wanted to cross the Channel because he speaks fluent English but with language classes he says he is happy to stay in France Anywhere there is peace I can stay no problem he says He is already waiting at the classroom more than half an hour before his teachers arrive He says he doesnt know much

electrical engineer is one of dozens perhaps hundreds of refugees living in the jungle camp outside Calais who have applied for asylum in France and really want to learn the language of what they hope will be their new home Like many of his fellow students he is frustrated by the media coverage of the sprawling tentvillage He says it focuses only on those people who use the village as a place to stay while they make risky attempts every night to sneak on board crossChannel lorries or trains I want people in the UK to know that not everyone wants to go there There are a lot of people here who want to stay in France Kamal said France is already home to more than a quarter of a million refugees according to United Nations data this is more than twice as many as the UK even though the countries have similar populations There are also 56000 asylum seekers waiting for permission to stay in France the second highest number in Europe while in the UK there are 36000 But while the applicants wait to hear if they can stay France does not give them any financial support or allow them to work and the slow process can take many months The jungle camp offers a free meal a day and a plastic roof over their heads Many decide to live in these basic conditions for a few extra months rather than jeopardize their chance to stay in France by working illegally The idea for the school

questionnaire It will give anyone a DQ score The website also gives people advice on how to improve their understanding and protect themselves and their families online The ways in which children contact each other are very different from older generations The biggest change is in time spent talking on the phone Twenty years ago teenagers spent their evenings on the home telephone line talking about love and friendships in conversations that lasted for hours But now for children aged 12 to 15 phone calls make up just 3 of time spent communicating through any device For all adults this rises to 20 and for young adults it is 9 Todays children communicate most by sending written messages or through sharing photographs and videos Over 90 of the time they spend using devices is spent sending

online The ways in which millennial children contact each other and consume entertainment are so different from previous generations that forecasters now believe their preferences to be a better indication of the future than the preferences of trendsetting young adults The most remarkable change is in time spent talking by phone Two decades ago teenagers spent their evenings monopolizing the home telephone line talking about love affairs and friendships in conversations that lasted for hours For those aged 12 to 15 phone calls account for just 3 of time spent communicating through any device For all adults this rises to 20 and for young adults it is still three times as high at 9 Todays children do the majority of their remote socializing by sending written messages or through

43,Europe is trying to reduce air pollution Europe will become the first part of the world to force car makers to use realworld emissions tests New regulations will introduce tests that will demonstrate clearly what cars emissions are like when they are driving on roads and in traffic not in ideal conditions similar to a laboratory The European Commission has approved the tests The tests will make sure all cars meet a limit of 80mg of nitrogen oxide per kilometre At present only one car in 16 meets this limit Other countries such as China and Korea are also considering realworld emissions tests They will watch what happens next closely In the UK 29000 people die every year because of pollution Pollutants from diesel engines such as nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide are responsible for at least one quarter of those deaths The current laboratory test for measuring emissions is 25 years old and it needs to change Car makers can cheat during the tests on their cars using various techniques For example they can tape up doors and windows to reduce air resistance drive on really smooth roads and test at very high temperatures The Commission will introduce a new emissions test that will properly check the cars in real driving said Lucia Caudet a Commission spokesperson One key reason why air pollution kills 400000 European citizens each year is that car makers cheat the tests for diesel cars this causes much more pollution on the road said Greg Archer the clean vehicles manager for Transport and Environment The development of a new realworld driving emission test is an important step towards reducing air pollution in cities European Union EU states should now support the Commissions idea They should ignore the complaints from car makers who say that the rules are too tough According to research by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2014 actual nitrogen oxide emissions from cars are seven times higher than the 80mg per kilometre standard and some cars are 22 times above the recommended limit About one third of all nitrogen oxide pollution comes from road transport mostly diesel and in cities concentrations can be as high as 64 according to European Environment Agency data Campaigners say that car makers have tried to delay reforms to car tests But car makers do not agree they say that they need five years to introduce the changes for technical and economic reasons Real Driving Emissions is a totally new regulation that will force significant changes said Cara McLaughlin a spokesperson for the European Automobile Manufacturers Association ACEA But ACEA fully accepts that the regulation will apply to new types of cars from September 2017 When EU representatives finally agreed a regulation for nitrogen oxide limits with stricter road trials and monitoring of exhaust fumes ACEA sent the European Commission their own draft regulation ACEAs draft regulation covered fewer pollutants and they wanted to introduce the regulation only in 2020 It included shorter test distances from 1300 metres to below 700 metres raised minimum temperatures from 7C to 3C and wanted to use more country roads for the tests The Commission rejected ACEAs draft regulation The new regulation will now probably be introduced in September By 2017 the first realworld car emissions tests should begin Countries around the world will watch the introduction of the EUs new emissions tests carefully,In an attempt to reduce air pollution Europe will become the first part of the world to force car makers to use realworld emissions tests New regulations will introduce the tests to reveal what cars emissions are like when driving on roads and in traffic not in ideal laboratorylike conditions which is what happens at the moment The tests which have been approved by the European Commission are designed to enforce a limit of 80mg of nitrogen oxide per kilometre a level that only one car in 16 meets Other countries such as China and Korea which are also considering realworld emissions tests will be watching what happens closely Pollutants from diesel engines such as nitrogen oxide carbon monoxide and particulates are believed to be responsible for at least one quarter of the 29000 annual pollutionrelated deaths in the UK alone The current New European Drive Cycle laboratory test for measuring emissions is a quarter of a century old Technological developments in the car industry mean that the test is no longer good enough Studies have shown that the results of lab techniques to measure car emissions can easily be fixed car makers fix the results by using techniques such as taping up doors and windows to minimize air resistance driving on unrealistically smooth roads and testing at very high temperatures The Commission wants to introduce a new emissions testing procedure that will allow proper assessment of the vehicles in real driving said Lucia Caudet a Commission spokesperson One key reason why air pollution kills 400000 citizens each year is that car makers cheat the tests for diesel cars causing much more pollution on the road said Greg Archer the clean vehicles manager for Transport and Environment The development of a new realworld driving emission test is an important step forward in tackling urban air pollution European Union EU states should now support the Commissions proposals and ignore the whingeing from car makers that the rules are too strict According to research by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2014 actual nitrogen oxide emissions from cars are seven times higher than the 80mg per kilometre standard with some types of cars 22 times above the recommended limit Only one car out of 16 met the 80mg target Around one third of all nitrogen oxide pollution comes from road transport mostly diesel and in cities concentrations can be as high as 64 according to European Environment Agency data Campaigners say that the car industry has tried to delay reforms to car test cycles But industry groups deny this they argue that a fiveyear delay is necessary for technical and economic reasons Real Driving Emissions RDE is a totally new regulation that will force significant changes to cars said Cara McLaughlin a spokesperson for the European Automobile Manufacturers Association ACEA However ACEA fully accepts that RDE will apply to new types of cars from September 2017 ACEA sent the European Commission their own draft regulation for consideration after EU representatives finally agreed a regulation to implement the nitrogen oxide limits with strengthened road trials and strict monitoring of exhaust fumes ACEAs draft regulation would have covered fewer pollutants and delayed the regulations introduction until 2020 Test distances would have been shortened from 1300m to below 700m minimum temperatures would have been raised from 7C to 3C and more rural roads would have been used The ACEA draft was rejected

117,The senior editor of The Atlantic magazine James Hamblin recently did an experiment As part of his series If Our Bodies Could Talk Hamblin reduced the number of showers he had and did not use shampoo and soap when he had a shower He discovered what thousands of others have also discovered the more we try to clean ourselves with soaps and body washes the more our skin works to get back its balance This means we have to begin the whole process again Showering removes oil and bacteria from the skin Many would say That is the reason I shower But it seems that this sometimes works too well especially when you add hot water and soap products Our skin has millions of good bacteria Showering destroys these bacteria And when the bacteria return they produce an odour yes showering too often may make you smell more But when you stop showering and using soap your skin goes through a probably gross period of change After this the skin normally gets its balance back it produces less oil and healthy bacteria ourish Hamblin realized that the human body working on its own is lovely We will smell and look better skin experts say that using less soap can improve skin problems But thats not the only advantage reducing the number of showers we have and the number of cleansing products we use can help the environment The average shower lasts seven minutes and uses 65 litres of water Thats 65 litres of clean drinkable water that we ll with soap and wash down the drain each and every day sometimes more than once The importance of clean water is becoming harder and harder to ignore for example there is another summer of drought in California Its becoming clear that clean water is one of the most valuable things in the world and we soon wont have enough There is also the environmental effect of all those body wash bottles So there are many very good reasons to shower less Perhaps you remember the last time you were close to people who already dont shower enough but you can relax Many people who shower less still use deodorant and handwashing with soap is still a vital way to reduce the spread of many diseases You dont need to give up showering completely as James Hamblin did but if you shower a lot we have some simple advice reduce Shower less put down the soap and let those lovely little bacteria ourish,James Hamblin senior editor of The Atlantic magazine recently did an experiment As part of his series If Our Bodies Could Talk Hamblin took on a noshowering challenge to examine the effect of overcleansing the body He reduced the number of showers he had and did not use shampoo or soap when he had a shower He discovered what thousands of others have the more we try to clean ourselves with soaps and body washes the harder our skin works to restore its balance and this encourages us to begin the whole process again Showering removes oil and bacteria from the skin Many would say That is the reason I shower But apparently this sometimes works a little too well especially when you add hot water and cleansing products You know that feeling after a shower when you feel like your skin is tight Thats because much of your skins natural moisture has been washed down the drain Also our skin like our gut has millions of bene cial bacteria Showering destroys these bacterial colonies theyre completely destroyed by all our frequent rubbing and scrubbing And when the bacteria washed off by soap return they usually favour microbes which produce an odour yes showering too often may actually make you smell more However when you stop showering and using soap your skin goes through an initial probably gross adjustment period and then after that the skin typically restores balance oil production slows and healthy bacteria ourish By doing the challenge Hamblin realized what other nosoapnoshower fans have known for years that the human body working on its own is actually quite lovely And its not just scent and aesthetics although skin experts suggest that using less soap can improve skin conditions like eczema Reducing the frequency of showers and the number of cleansing products used has implications for our environment The average shower lasts seven minutes and uses 65 litres of water Thats 65 litres of clean drinkable water that were lling with soap and washing down the drain each day sometimes more than once The vital importance of clean water is becoming harder and harder to ignore as California enters another summer of drought Its becoming clear that clean water is one of the most valuable things in the world and

using less soap is giving you the heebiejeebies as you remember the last time you were close to people who already dont shower enough relax Many people who have decided to shower less still use deodorant if they nd it necessary everyones natural scent varies in intensity and it can be affected by a number of things including diet hydration and exercise And handwashing with soap is still recommended as a vital way to reduce the spread of infectious diseases You dont need to give up completely as Hamblin did but you dont need to shower three times a day either There is something in the middle Our familiar simple advice is reduce Skip a few showers put down the soap and let those lovely little bacteria ourish a little,train,ELE,INT
133,The auction of a Banksy painting that disappeared from the wall of a north London shop was stopped just moments before it was going to be sold Slave Labour is a spraypainted artwork that shows a child making flags The expected price was about 700000 It was going to be in a sale of street art in Florida But Frederic Thut the owner of the Fine Arts Auction Miami art house said that Slave Labour and a second work by the secretive British street artist were removed from sale at the auction He did not want to give the name of the seller People in Haringey London were very happy because they led a campaign to stop the sale of the artwork that was removed from the wall of a Poundland shop in Haringey I will write to the auction house to find out what will happen next but for now we are really pleased that a peoples campaign in London has had an impact in the US Its a real victory for the people said Alan Strickland a Haringey councillor The auction house said it had told the owners of the two Banksys that they should remove them from the sale There are no legal problems with the sale of the artwork by Banksy but FAAM told its sellers they should remove them from the auction Critics have said the auction house was buying and selling stolen property but Thut said that the seller was the real owner and that the sale was legal He added that his gallery had received many emails and phone calls from the UK but said he thought it was right to sell the two pieces of artwork because it would keep them safe The second Banksy that was going to be auctioned was a 2007 artwork called Wet Dog that was removed from a Bethlehem wall Its estimated price is up to 800000 Poundland said it had no idea who removed the 4ft x 5ft mural from the side of its shop Banksy himself has not commented on the sale of Slave Labour but he has condemned people who have tried to sell his artwork in the past Stephan Keszler the dealer at a 2011 auction in New York that also planned to sell Bankys paintings believes selling Banksys works without his permission is fair He does something on other peoples walls and houses without asking The owner of the property can do whatever they want with it Keszler said,The controversial auction of a Banksy mural that disappeared from the wall of a north London shop was dramatically stopped just moments before it was going to be sold Slave Labour is a spraypainted artwork showing a child making British flags and is seen as a critical social commentary on last years diamond jubilee It was expected to sell for about 700000 in a sale of street and contemporary art in Florida But auctioneer Frederic Thut the owner of the Fine Arts Auction Miami art house who had refused all week to give the name of the seller announced that Slave Labour together with a second work by the secretive British street artist had been removed from sale at the auction He would not give a reason but community leaders in Haringey London who led a campaign to stop the sale of the artwork that was removed from the wall of a Poundland shop in Wood Green were extremely happy One of our two demands was that it doesnt sell and the other was that we get it back again so were halfway there said Alan Strickland a Haringey councillor I will be writing to the auction house to clarify what happened and what will happen next but for now we are really pleased that a community campaign in London has had an impact in the US Its a real victory for the people Claire Kober Leader of Haringey Council wrote to Arts Council England and the Mayor of Miami Toms Regalado to ask them to stop the sale but it appears the decision to remove the item from sale came from the gallery owners Several hours after the auction the auction house said it had persuaded the owners of the two Banksys to remove them from the sale Although there are no legal issues whatsoever regarding the sale of lots six and seven by Banksy FAAM convinced its sellers to remove these lots from the auction Critics have accused the auction house of buying and selling stolen property but Thut said that the seller who he described as a well known collector was the rightful owner and that the sale was legal He added that his gallery had received many emails and phone calls from the UK but said he supported selling the two pieces of artwork because it would preserve them The second Banksy to be auctioned a 2007 artwork called Wet Dog that was removed from a Bethlehem wall and is estimated to be worth up to 800000 was removed from the auction houses online catalogue but Slave Labour was still listed for sale right up to the 3pm start time Thut said the two pieces supplied to him by separate owners neither of them British were important works in the street art scene and deserved buyers whose first interest is in art and its preservation A spokesperson for Poundland said it had no idea who removed the 4ft x 5ft mural from the side of one of its shops in London Banksy himself has not commented on the Slave Labour controversy but he has previously condemned people who have tried to sell his artwork He spoke out before five of his pieces were going to be sold at a 2011 auction in New York None found a buyer Stephan Keszler the dealer at that auction believes selling Banksys works without his permission is legitimate He does something on other peoples property without asking

62,Life isnt fair sometimes Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook and is now worth 48 billion James Goodfellow also invented something that millions of people around the world use every day the cash machine but it didnt make him rich In fact he earned just 10 from the patent and has not made any money from it since Who is the inventor of the ATM People have argued for years over this question In 2005 a man called John ShepherdBarron received a UK honour as the inventor of the automatic cash dispenser But the UK government is now saying it was Goodfellow who invented the ATM In the mid1960s Goodfellows managers asked him to think of a way to allow customers to withdraw cash from banks on Saturdays Most people worked during the week and couldnt go to the bank They wanted a solution The solution was a machine which would give cash to a customer he says I wanted to develop a cash machine and to make this happen I invented the PIN personal identi cation number and a coded token Goodfellows first machines were installed in 1967 At around the same time ShepherdBarron was developing a similar machine His machine didnt use plastic cards it used cheques Most people agree that ShepherdBarrons ATM was the worlds rst to be installed and used by the public The rst one was at a bank in north London It was opened on 27 June 1967 a month before Goodfellows ATM appeared But Goodfellow registered the patent for his machine on 2 May 1966 14 months before ShepherdBarrons ATM machine was rst used ShepherdBarron received an of cial honour for his invention and Goodfellow says My one big regret is that I never said anything about it until John ShepherdBarron received the honour in 2005 The Queen gave him this honour for inventing the automatic cash dispenser That really annoyed me and I complained about it ShepherdBarron is dead now but in a 2005 interview he criticized Goodfellow He said Goodfellows invention was a failure The cash machine is now used all over the world and every year there are more and more there are now three million ATMs worldwide and there will be four million by 2020 The good news for Goodfellow is that people are beginning to recognize him for his invention The website ATMInventorcom says Who invented the idea of an ATM We believe it was Luther George Simjian Who invented the ATM as we know it It was James Goodfellow for holding a patent date of 1966 Even better for Goodfellow his invention is in a 180page guidebook called Life in the United Kingdom In the section about great British inventions of the twentieth century it says In the 1960s James Goodfellow 1937 invented the automatic teller machine ATM or cashpoint So after all these years Goodfellow is nally among a group of famous British inventors with John Logie Baird the television Alan Turing the Turing machine Sir Frank Whittle the jet engine and Sir Tim BernersLee the World Wide Web When he was asked what he did with the 10 he received in the 1960s Goodfellow said he spent it on a night out It didnt change my life he said,Sometimes life isnt fair Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook and is now worth an estimated 48bn James Goodfellow also invented something used by millions of people around the world every day the cash machine but it didnt make him rich In fact he earned just 10 from the patent and has not made a penny more from it since You can imagine how I feel when I see bankers getting 1m bonuses What have they contributed to the banking industry compared to me to merit a 1m bonus Goodfellow says He invented something that generated billions of pounds and he got nothing There have been arguments for years over who is the inventor of the ATM and in 2005 a man called John ShepherdBarron received a UK honour as the inventor of the automatic cash dispenser But the UK government is now saying it was Goodfellow who invented the ATM so it seems that after all the arguments he now has his place in history Back in the mid1960s Goodfellow was working as a development engineer and was asked to devise a way to allow customers to withdraw cash from banks on Saturdays Most people worked during the week and couldnt get to the bank They wanted a solution The solution was a machine which would give cash to a recognized customer he remembers I wanted to develop a cashissuing machine and to make this a reality I invented the PIN personal identi cation number and a coded token This token was a plastic card with holes in it The patent documents described a system with a card reader and buttons mounted in an external wall of the bank After Goodfellow produced a model that showed how the machine would work prototypes were built and the rst machines were installed in 1967 At around the same time ShepherdBarron was developing a rival machine His machine didnt use plastic cards instead it used cheques containing carbon14 a mildly radioactive substance The machine detected the carbon14 matched the cheque against a PIN and paid out the cash It is widely accepted that the ShepherdBarron ATM was the worlds rst to be installed and used by the public the rst one at a bank in north London was opened on 27 June 1967 a month before Goodfellows ATM appeared However the patent for Goodfellows machine was lodged on 2 May 1966 14 months before ShepherdBarrons ATM machine was first used ShepherdBarron received an of cial honour for his achievement and Goodfellow says My one big regret is that I never said anything about it until John ShepherdBarron received the OBE in 2005 for inventing the automatic cash dispenser That really stuck in my throat and I kicked up a fuss ShepherdBarron is no longer alive but in a 2005 interview he was quite critical of his rival I dont know him but its clear that the difference between Goodfellow and us was that we thought through the whole system concept and that was important to the banks who bought it His invention reminds me of the hovercraft an elegant failure The cash machine is now used all over the world and nothing the contactless revolution bitcoin wearable technology etc is slowing its growth there are now 3m ATMs worldwide and by 2020 there will probably be 4m The good news for Goodfellow is that he is beginning to be recognized for his invention The website ATMInventorcom says Who invented the idea of an ATM We believe it was Luther George Simjian Who invented the ATM as we know it We have to think it was James Goodfellow for holding a patent date of 1966 Who invented the ATM design we recognize today We think it was John D White in the US Even better for Goodfellow his achievement has been of cially recognized in the latest edition of a 180page guidebook called Life in the United Kingdom In the section about great British inventions of the twentieth

134,How long can you hold your breath Im trying it right now The rst 30 seconds are easy I want to give up at 45 seconds but I continue and it gets easier for a while But as I go past one minute my heart is pounding I breathe out a tiny bit and this helps One minute and 12 seconds Im quite impressed with myself In some sports it is very important to be able to hold your breath particularly in freediving In 2006 I met Sam Amps who was captain of the UK freedive team At a swimming pool in Bristol she taught me some simple ways to help me hold my breath for longer while swimming underwater By the end of the session I could hold my breath for 90 seconds long enough to let me swim across the pool Sam swam across the pool three times easily She could hold her breath for ve minutes while swimming Five minutes I asked how she did it very slow breathing for several minutes before each dive then a big deep breath before diving in Our heart rate doesnt slow down when we hold our breath At least it doesnt if youre doing it on land When youre under cold water the heart rate slows down in most people This change in our bodies is useful in diving but it is even more useful for not drowning Holding our breath is becoming very useful in one particular area of medicine Radiotherapy for breast cancer involves pointing radiation exactly at the tumour Its usually done in short periods between breaths But if the patient can hold their breath for several minutes it means that doctors can give the complete radiation dose in the right place all at the same time The problem of course is that most people cannot hold their breath for several minutes But doctors at University Hospital Birmingham have shown that if patients are given air with extra oxygen before holding their breath they can hold it for veandahalf minutes Surprisingly to achieve this you have to fool the diaphragm When you breathe in youre pulling the muscle of your diaphragm at so that the volume of your chest increases this pulls the air into your lungs When you hold your breath you keep your diaphragm like that If you breathe extra oxygen before a breathhold as in the Birmingham radiotherapy experiments you may be able to stop the diaphragm from becoming tired too quickly So its your diaphragm the main muscle of breathing that is in charge when you are holding your breath But in the end even if youve fooled it for a while the signals from the diaphragm become too strong and you have to give up and take a breath,How long can you hold your breath Im trying it right now The rst 30 seconds are easy Im ready to give up at 45 seconds but I continue and it seems to get easier for a while But as the second hand ticks past a minute my heart is pounding I let out a tiny breath and this helps Eventually I give up releasing the air in my lungs and taking a huge breath I manage one minute and 12 seconds Im quite impressed with myself The ability to hold your breath is extremely important in some sports particularly freediving In 2006 I was lming a programme about the anatomy and physiology of the lungs for a BBC series I was lucky to meet Sam Amps who was captain of the UK freedive team At a pool in Bristol she taught me some simple exercises to help me hold my breath for longer while swimming underwater By the end of the session Id managed 90 seconds of breathholding enough to let me swim a width Sam swam three widths easily She could hold her breath for ve minutes while swimming Five I asked how she did it very slow breathing for several minutes before each dive then a big deep breath before diving in She also said that training helped her resist the urge to breathe for far longer than most people Some have suggested that the ability to voluntarily hold your breath is evidence that at some point during our evolution we lived in water Some even say that humans have an ability to lower their heart rate in order to breathhold for even longer Other facts our hairlessness the distribution of our subcutaneous fat and even that we walk on two legs have been linked to an aquatic phase of our evolutionary development But unfortunately the aquatic ape hypothesis is not true Looking at voluntary breathholding we are in fact not the only nonaquatic mammals that are able to hold their breath But its a dif cult thing to investigate in other mammals because unlike humans its dif cult to get them to hold their breath And evidence shows that our heart rate doesnt drop during breathholding At least it doesnt if youre breathholding on land When youre in cold water its different this leads to a slower heart rate in most people But once again this isnt evidence of an aquatic ape ancestry This reduction in heart rate is just one of the physiological responses that are sometimes called the mammalian diving re ex But physiological responses that are useful in diving are also and perhaps even more importantly useful for not drowning While our ability to breathhold may not be special when we compare ourselves with other animals its now becoming very useful in one particular area of medicine Radiotherapy for breast cancer involves pointing radiation very precisely at the tumour This may require several minutes of radiation and so its usually done in short periods between breaths But if the patient can keep her chest perfectly still for several minutes it means that the entire dose can be given in the right place in one go The problem of course is that most people just like me cannot hold their breath for much longer than a minute But doctors at University Hospital Birmingham have shown that if patients are given oxygenrich air before holding their breath they can hold it for veandahalf minutes Surprisingly the trick seems to be the ability to fool the diaphragm When you breathe in youre pulling the muscle of your diaphragm at so that the volume of your chest increases and air is pulled into your lungs When you hold your breath you keep your diaphragm like that If you arti cially raise oxygen levels and reduce carbon dioxide levels before a breathhold as in the Birmingham radiotherapy experiments you may be able to delay tiredness in the diaphragm So its your diaphragm the main muscle of breathing that is in charge when it comes to holding your breath Eventually even if youve fooled it for a while the signals from the diaphragm are just too strong and you have to give up and take a breath,train,ELE,INT
29,The researchers were surprised by what people would do to avoid the task What was the task To sit in a chair and do nothing but think Some people found it so unbearable that they gave themselves mild electric shocks to stop the boredom Twothirds of men pressed a button that gave them a painful shock during a 15minute period of solitude A quarter of women also pressed the shock button The report from psychologists at Virginia and Harvard Universities looks at the question of why most of us nd it so hard to do nothing In more than 11 separate studies the researchers showed that all kinds of people hated being left alone to think it doesnt matter what their age education or income is or how often they use smartphones or social media Researcher Timothy Wilson said that the results were probably not because of the speed of modern life or because of mobile phones and social media Instead he said those things might be popular because we feel we need to do something and hate doing nothing During the rst experiments students were taken into a room and told to think They were alone without their phones books or anything to write with The only rules were that they had to stay sitting and not fall asleep They were told that they would have six to 15 minutes alone The students were questioned at the end of the experiment Most of them did not enjoy the experience They found it dif cult to concentrate and their minds wandered The researchers did the experiment again with people at home They got similar results Surprisingly people found it even more dif cult and they cheated by getting up from their chair or checking their phones The researchers did the study again with more than 100 people aged 18 to 77 from a church and a farmers market They also disliked just sitting and thinking But there was an even more surprising result To check if people might prefer something bad to nothing at all the students had the possibility of giving themselves a mild electric shock Before the experiment all the students said they would pay to avoid mild electric shocks But 12 of 18 men gave themselves electric shocks and six of 24 women gave themselves electric shocks The scientists were surprised They said that being alone with their thoughts was so hard for many participants that they gave themselves an electric shock something the participants had said they would pay not to get Jessica AndrewsHanna at the University of Colorado said many students would probably give themselves an electric shock to make a boring lecture more exciting But she says we need to know more about Wilsons study Imagine a person is told to sit in a chair with wires attached to their skin and a button that will give them a harmless but uncomfortable shock and they are told to just sit there with their thoughts she said As they sit there their mind starts to wander and naturally they think about that shock was it really that bad,What surprised researchers was not how hard people found the challenge but how far they would go to avoid it The task To sit in a chair and do nothing but think Some found it so unbearable that they took the safe but alarming opportunity to give themselves mild electric shocks to break the tedium Twothirds of men pressed a button that gave them a painful shock during a 15minute period of solitude Under the same conditions a quarter of women pressed the shock button The difference scientists suspect is that men are typically more sensationseeking than women The report from psychologists at Virginia and Harvard Universities tries to answer the question of why most of us nd it so hard to do nothing In more than 11 separate studies the researchers showed that people hated being left to think regardless of their age education income or the amount of time they spent on smartphones or social media Timothy Wilson who led the work said the ndings were not necessarily due to the pace of modern life or the spread of mobile devices and social media Instead those things might be popular because of our constant need to do something rather than nothing In the rst experiments students were taken alone without phones books or anything to write with into a room and told to think The only rules were that they had to stay seated and not fall asleep They were told that they would have six to 15 minutes alone The students were questioned when the time was up On average they did not enjoy the experience They struggled to concentrate Their minds wandered even with nothing to distract them In case the unfamiliar setting reduced the ability to think the researchers did the experiment again with people at home They got similar results In fact people found the experience even more miserable and cheated by getting up from their chair or checking their phones To see if the effect was found only in students the scientists tested more than 100 other people aged 18 to 77 from a church and a farmers market They also disliked being left to their thoughts But the most surprising result was yet to come To check whether people might actually prefer something bad to nothing at all the students were given the option of giving themselves a mild electric shock They had been asked earlier to say how unpleasant the shocks were compared to other options such as looking at pictures of cockroaches or hearing the sound of a knife rubbing against a bottle All the students chosen for the test said they would pay to avoid mild electric shocks To the researchers surprise 12 of 18 men gave themselves up to four electric shocks and six of 24 women did the same The scientists said that the most surprising thing was that being alone with their thoughts was so hard for many people that they gave themselves an electric shock something the participants had earlier said they would pay to avoid Jessica AndrewsHanna at the University of Colorado said many students would probably give themselves an electric shock to cheer up a tedious lecture But she says we need to know more about the motivation of the shockers in Wilsons study Imagine a person is told to sit in a chair with wires attached to their skin and a button that will

130,Coal will probably rival oil as the worlds biggest source of energy in the next five years This might be a disaster for the climate One of the biggest reasons behind the rise in coal use is the big increase in the use of shale gas in the US New research from the International Energy Agency IEA shows that all over the world people are using more coal except in the US where shale gas is now more popular than coal Because the US is using less coal coal prices across the world have reduced This has made coal more attractive even in Europe Maria van der Hoeven Executive Director of the IEA said that the amount of coal we use continues to grow each year and if no changes are made coal will catch oil within ten years Coal is available in large amounts and it can be found in most regions of the world unlike oil and gas and it is cheap to extract The IEA says that China and India will drive world coal use in the next five years and India will probably overtake the US as the worlds second biggest consumer China is the biggest coal importer and Indonesia is the biggest coal exporter According to the IEAs MediumTerm Coal Market Report the world will burn 12bn more tonnes of coal per year by 2017 compared with today With the highest carbon emissions coal makes climate change a lot worse especially when it is burned in oldfashioned inefficient power stations Coal can also produce sulphur emissions these lead to acid rain and mercury and sootparticle pollution Van der Hoeven says that we should make coal more expensive so that people prefer to use cleaner technologies such as renewable power Providing cheaper gas is the only way to reduce demand for coal This has happened in the US because of the big increase in the production of shale gas there in the past five years She said The US experience suggests that a more efficient gas market can reduce coal use carbon dioxide emissions and electricity bills Europe China and other regions should take note If something isnt done soon there will be more climate change,Coal will probably rival oil as the worlds biggest source of energy in the next five years with possible disastrous consequences for the climate says the worlds leading authority on energy economics One of the biggest factors behind the rise in coal use has been the massive increase in the use of shale gas in the US New research from the International Energy Agency IEA shows that coal consumption is increasing all over the world even in countries and regions with carboncutting targets except in the US where shale gas is now more popular than coal The decline of coal consumption in the US has helped to cut prices for coal globally This has made it more attractive even in Europe where coal use was supposed to be discouraged by the Emissions Trading Scheme Maria van der Hoeven Executive Director of the IEA said that coal consumption continues to grow each year and if no changes are made coal will catch oil within a decade Coal is available in large amounts and found in most regions of the world unlike conventional oil and gas and can be cheaply extracted According to the IEA China and India will drive world coal use in the coming five years with India likely to overtake the US as the worlds second biggest consumer China is the biggest coal importer and Indonesia the biggest exporter According to the IEAs MediumTerm Coal Market Report the world will burn 12bn more tonnes of coal per year by 2017 compared with today With the highest carbon emissions of any major fossil fuel coal is a huge contributor to climate change particularly when burned in oldfashioned inefficient power stations When these are not equipped with special scrubbing equipment to remove chemicals coal can also produce sulphur emissions the leading cause of acid rain and mercury and sootparticle pollution Van der Hoeven said that without a high carbon price to discourage the growth in coal use and encourage cleaner technologies such as renewable power only competition from lowerpriced gas could reduce demand for coal This has happened in the US due to the extraordinary increase in the production of shale gas in that market in the past five years She said The US experience suggests that a more efficient gas market can reduce coal use carbon dioxide emissions and consumers electricity bills Europe China and other regions should take note If something isnt done the world faces an increased risk of climate change as a result of this fastincreasing consumption of the highest carbon fossil fuel,train,ELE,INT
172,A British court has decided that three old Kenyans who were put in prison and tortured during the fighting in Kenya in the 1950s can sue the British government There are thousands of other people who were put in prison and say they were treated badly during the final days of the British Empire and now they may also try to sue British government lawyers said that too much time had passed since the sevenyear fight in the 1950s and it was no longer possible to have a fair trial The court did not accept this In 2011 the government said that the three claimants should sue the Kenyan government because it became legally responsible after independence in 1963 But the judge did not accept this either 70000 people were put in prison by the British in Kenya and more than 5000 of them are still alive Many of them may sue the British government The court decision may also make it possible for victims in other parts of the world to sue The Foreign Office said it will appeal against the decision The normal time limit for a civil action is three to six years they said In this case that period has been extended to over 50 years but the people who made the decisions are dead and they cant give their view of what happened The victory for Paulo Muoka Nzili 85 Wambugu Wa Nyingi 84 and Jane Muthoni Mara 73 was the result of a threeyear battle in the courts Their lawyers said they had suffered terrible brutality In the Kenyan capital Nairobi Nyingi and Mara heard the news by mobile phone They reacted with joy when they heard hugging dancing and praying Nyingi who was put in prison and beaten said For me I just wanted everyone to know the truth Even the children of my children should know what happened What should happen is that people should be compensated so they can begin to forgive the British government Mara said Im very happy and my heart is clean The judge said in 2011 that there was a lot of evidence to show that prisoners were perhaps tortured He decided that a fair trial was possible especially because thousands of secret documents from the colonial era were found in 2011 The British governments lawyers accepted that all three of the old Kenyans were tortured The claimants lawyer said The British government has admitted that these three Kenyans were brutally tortured but they have tried not to take any legal responsibility There will be victims of colonial torture from Malaya to the Yemen from Cyprus to Palestine who will be very interested in this case People who fought in Cyprus in the 1950s are interested in the Mau Mau case One has already met the Kenyan claimants lawyers Cypriot claimants could use British documents and also the documents of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva Those documents are kept secret for 40 years and then opened to the public The Red Cross recorded hundreds of torture cases in Cyprus There may also be claims from Malaysia where large numbers of people were put in prison during the 12year war with communist fighters and their supporters that began in 1948 24 farm workers who were without weapons were killed by British troops their families are now fighting for a public inquiry Many exprisoners of the British in Aden may also have claims against the British government But Aden is now part of Yemen and British lawyers may have problems making contact with possible claimants there,The High Court in London has ruled that three elderly Kenyans detained and tortured during the Mau Mau rebellion have the right to sue Now the British government is afraid that thousands of legal claims may follow from people who were imprisoned and who say they were treated badly during the final days of the British Empire The governments lawyers said that too much time had passed since the sevenyear insurgency in the 1950s and it was no longer possible to hold a fair trial but the court rejected these claims In 2011 the same judge rejected the governments claim that the three claimants should sue the Kenyan government because it had inherited Britains legal responsibilities on independence in 1963 Human rights activists in Kenya estimate more than 5000 of the 70000 people detained by the British colonial authorities are still alive Many may bring claims against the British government The ruling may also make it possible for victims of colonial atrocities in other parts of the world to sue The Foreign Office said that the ruling had potentially significant legal implications and said it was planning to appeal The normal time limit for bringing a civil action is three to six years a spokesman said In this case that period has been extended to over 50 years despite the fact that the key decision makers are dead and unable to give their view of what happened The historic victory for Paulo Muoka Nzili 85 Wambugu Wa Nyingi 84 and Jane Muthoni Mara 73 was the result of a threeyear battle in the courts Their lawyers said they had suffered unspeakable acts of brutality In the Kenyan capital Nairobi Nyingi and Mara heard the news by mobile phone They had been sitting silently with their supporters in a garden and reacted with joy when the word came hugging dancing and raising their hands to the sky to pray Nyingi who was detained for about nine years beaten unconscious and still has the scars said For me I just wanted the truth to be out Even the children of my children should know what happened What should happen is that people should be compensated so they can begin to forgive the British government Mara said Im very happy and my heart is clean When she was asked what she would tell her four children she said simply I will tell them I won The judge said in 2011 that there was ample evidence that there may have been systematic torture of detainees On Friday he ruled that a fair trial was possible and highlighted the fact that thousands of secret files from the colonial era appeared in 2011 The British governments lawyers tried to have the claims rejected but they accepted that all three of the elderly Kenyans were tortured by the colonial authorities The claimants lawyer said The British government has admitted that these three Kenyans were brutally tortured but they have been trying to avoid any legal responsibility There will undoubtedly be victims of colonial torture from Malaya to the Yemen from Cyprus to Palestine who will be reading this judgment with great care A number of veterans of the insurgency in Cyprus in the 1950s watched the case closely One has already met the Mau Mau claimants lawyers Any Cypriot claimants could rely not only on British documents but also on the archives of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva Those files are kept secret for 40 years and then opened to public examination The Red Cross documented hundreds of torture cases in Cyprus There may also be claims from Malaysia where large numbers of people were detained during the 12year war with communist insurgents and their supporters that began in 1948 Relatives of 24 unarmed rubber plantation workers who were killed by British troops are currently fighting through the British courts for a public inquiry Many former prisoners of the British in Aden may also have claims against the British government although Aden is now part of Yemen and British lawyers may have problems making contact with

family when I was very small He said that he read the stories written about him Of course I read them the prince said If theres a story and somebody writes something about me I want to know what they

more comfortable being Captain Wales than Prince Harry his reply was revealing Definitely Ive always been like that My fathers always trying to tell me about who I am and things like that But its very easy to forget about who I am when I am in the army Everyones wearing the same uniform and doing the same kind of thing I get on well with the lads and I enjoy my job It really is as simple as that

41,Tua Pittman from Raratonga in the Cook Islands is a traditional navigator To him a canoe is more than just a form of transport The canoe is our island the crew is the community and the navigator is the leader he says On a canoe you are not just going from one place to another using the stars the moon the sun and the birds Navigation is showing your crew the light of life It has been a busy week for the crews of four sailing canoes they are in Sydney for the start of the World Parks Congress Tuas journey began at the Cook Islands on 25 September The islanders sailed to Samoa then Fiji Vanuatu and onto the Gold Coast Then they travelled south to Sydney Around 100 crew were involved in the voyage and they tried to travel using only traditional navigation techniques Sadly said Tua the crews had to use modern navigation equipment sometimes to reach Australia in time for the Congress The trip is called the Mua Voyage It is a partnership between the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN Oceania Regional Of ce and ve Paci c Island countries Samoa Tonga New Zealand the Cook Islands and Fiji The main aim of the 11000km trip was to deliver a special message to the World Parks Congress The message said We see fewer sh than in the past and they are smaller And foreign sherman take our sh Our coral reefs the greatest in the world and our shing grounds are disappearing Our ocean is very big but not limitless The Paci c Islanders message to the delegates of the Congress was urgent But a lot of time has been spent at the Congress trying to set a new target for the amount of the ocean that needs special protection According to the IUCN in 2013 less than three per cent of the worlds oceans was in marine protected areas and less than one per cent of that is no take no shing But there should be a lot more notake areas because the last World Parks Congress in 2003 set a target of 2030 After dif cult talks the World Parks Congress agreed new targets for marine protected areas The new target is not 2030 it is at least 30 And they must try to solve the problem of biodiversity Tua Pittman is very happy with what the Congress has decided for the worlds oceans Its a huge reward for all the effort that we made to be here To hear they made that decision is fantastic Its a step in the right direction He is 55 and in his lifetime he can already see that it is much harder to catch sh He also said that pollution is getting worse particularly close to big cities such as Sydney And climate change is already having a serious effect on Paci c Islanders The decisions of the big countries have a small effect on developed large countries but they have a very big effect on small countries The Mua Voyage had taken years of preparation and planning It was critical to the voyagers that the world listened to their message and took action Pittman said that the leaders of rich countries should think more like traditional navigators who see that their boats are just tiny specks in an enormous sea Most importantly Tua says that politicians must change how they do things The world needs to nd a different path The Mua Voyage had taken years of preparation

Pittman says He continues On a canoe you are not just going from one destination to another using the stars the moon the sun and the birds Navigation is using the philosophies of being a leader to show your crew members the light of life It has been a busy week for the crews of four sailing canoes since arriving in Sydney for the start of the World Parks Congress Tuas journey began at the Cook Islands on 25 September The islanders sailed to Samoa then Fiji Vanuatu and onto the Gold Coast before sailing south to Sydney Around 100 crew members were involved in the voyage and they aimed to travel using only traditional navigation techniques Unfortunately said Tua the crews had to rely on modern navigation equipment at times to reach Australia in time for the Congress The of cial title of the expedition is the Mua Voyage It is a partnership between the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN Oceania Regional Of ce and ve Paci c Island countries Samoa Tonga New Zealand the Cook Islands and Fiji The main goal of the 6000nauticalmile 11000km trip was to deliver a special message to the World Parks Congress The message said We see the signs of overexploitation We no longer see the sh and other marine creatures in the size diversity or abundance of the past We witness the change as foreign shing eets take our resources Our coral reefs the greatest in the world and our spawning grounds are disappearing Our ocean is vast but not limitless Growing global populations and unsustainable development are reducing the ability of our ocean to sustain life The Paci c Islanders have put a lot of effort into their urgent message to the delegates of the Congress But despite this the Congress has spent much of its time trying to set a revised target for the amount of the ocean that needs to be protected in marine sanctuaries According to the IUCN in 2013 the amount of the worlds oceans in marine protected areas was not even three per cent and less than one per cent of that is no take no shing This was despite a target of 2030 notake areas set by the last World Parks Congress in 2003 Marine scientist Professor Callum Roberts was one of the scientists who helped set the 2030 target in 2003 But he said it was not enough The IUCN should now lift its target from 30 to 33 New research shows that we need to raise the 30 target Any reduction in efforts at this stage and moment in history would be disastrous for our oceans After dif cult negotiations the World Parks Congress delegates passed a motion that will dramatically change the goals for global marine management Instead of the 2030 target the IUCN now says that each marine habitat should include strictly protected areas of at least 30 These areas should address both biodiversity and ecosystem services Tua Pittman was delighted with the news that a strong resolution on the planets oceans had passed the Congress Its a huge reward for all the effort that we made to be here and to be heard To hear they made that resolution is fantastic Its a step in the right direction He said he was 55 and in his lifetime he was already beginning to see that it was much harder to catch sh on the open ocean He also said that pollution was getting worse particularly as the canoes approached big cities such as Sydney And climate change is already beginning to have a serious effect on Paci c Islanders The decisions of the big countries impact on the small countries twice three times four times more than they impact on developed large nations The Mua Voyage had been a massive logistical undertaking said Tua Years of preparation and navigational planning went into such a trip and it was critical to the voyagers that the world listened to their message and acted He said that the leaders of wealthy countries need to start to think more like traditional navigators who recognize that their boats are just specks in an enormous sea Most importantly and spoken like a true navigator

2,Chemists have waited a long time to find a new element and now researchers in Japan Russia and the US have discovered four The four new elements will be added to the periodic table They are the first elements to be added since 2011 when elements 114 and 116 were included The new elements all very radioactive complete the seventh row of the periodic table The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry IUPAC is the global organization that controls chemical names IUPAC confirmed the new elements on 30 December 2015 The scientists who found them must now think of formal names for the elements which have the atomic numbers 113 115 117 and 118 The atomic number is the number of protons in an elements atomic nucleus IUPAC said that a RussianAmerican team of scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California had discovered elements 115 117 and 118 The organization said a team of scientists from the RIKEN Institute in Japan discovered element 113 The decision means Japan becomes the first Asian country to name an element Under IUPAC rules new elements can be named after mythological concepts minerals a place or country or a scientist In 2012 scientists chose the formal name flerovium for element 114 after the Flerov Lab at Dubnas Joint Institute of Research And they chose the formal name livermorium for element 116 after the Lawrence Livermore Lab in the US The elements were discovered there Kosuke Morita who led the research at RIKEN said his team now planned to look to element 119 and beyond Jan Reedijk of IUPAC said Chemists want to see the periodic table finally completed down to the seventh row The Japanese team is considering three names for element 113 japonium rikenium and nishinarium after the Nishina Center for AcceleratorBased Science where they found the element Polly Arnold professor of chemistry at Edinburgh University said This is very difficult and slow work The work helps us understand radioactive decay If we understand it better hopefully we can find a better way to deal with nuclear waste and things that are important in the real world And when they build the equipment to make these discoveries it also leads to fantastic improvements in technology Scientists must find new names for the elements but also they must suggest twoletter symbols for the elements When IUPAC has received the researchers suggestions they will tell the public so that people can comment on the names That allows scientists and others to find any problems with the names In 1996 someone suggested the symbol Cp for copernicium or element 112 but it was changed to Cn when scientists complained that Cp was already the symbol for another substance To discover the elements researchers at the three labs crashed lighter nuclei into one another and looked for the radioactive decays that should come from the new elements 113 and 115 are probably metals 117 could be a metalloid a material with some metallic characteristics The fourth element 118 may be a gas Paul Karol chair of the IUPAC panel that checked the elements said It will be a long time before we can find practical uses for the new elements,Chemists have waited a long time for a new element to turn up and now four have been discovered by researchers in Japan Russia and the US The four new elements are the first to be added to the periodic table since 2011 when elements 114 and 116 were included The new elements all highly radioactive complete seventh row of the periodic table and mean that science textbooks around the world are now out of date The USbased International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry IUPAC the global organization that controls chemical names terminology and measurement verified the elements on 30 December 2015 after examining studies dating back to 2004 The scientists who found them must now come up with formal names to replace the Latinbased temporary names ununtrium ununpentium ununseptium and ununoctium which reflect their atomic numbers 113 115 117 and 118 The atomic number is the number of protons found in an elements atomic nucleus IUPAC announced that a RussianAmerican team of scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California had produced enough evidence to claim the discovery of elements 115 117 and 118 The organization gave credit for the discovery of element 113 which had also been claimed by the Russians and Americans to a team of scientists from the RIKEN Institute in Japan The decision means Japan becomes the first Asian country to name an element Under IUPAC rules new elements can be named after mythological concepts minerals a place or country or a scientist When elements 114 and 116 were given formal names in 2012 scientists chose flerovium and livermorium respectively after the Flerov Lab at Dubnas Joint Institute of Research and the Lawrence Livermore Lab in the US where the elements were discovered Kosuke Morita who led the research at RIKEN said his team now planned to look to the uncharted territory of element 119 and beyond Jan Reedijk of IUPAC said The chemistry community is eager to see the table finally completed down to the seventh row The Japanese team is considering three names for ununtrium japonium rikenium and nishinarium after the Nishina Center for AcceleratorBased Science where the element was found They have been thinking about it for a while already said Polly Arnold professor of chemistry at Edinburgh University This is painstaking work The work helps us with our models and with understanding radioactive decay If we understand it better hopefully we can improve how we deal with nuclear waste and things that are important in the real world It also leads to fantastic technological advances in building the kit to make these observations Along with new names the scientists must suggest twoletter symbols for the elements When IUPAC has received the researchers suggestions they will go to public review for five months That allows scientists and others to raise any objections In 1996 the symbol Cp was suggested for copernicium or element 112 but it was changed to Cn when scientists complained that Cp referred to another substance To discover the elements researchers at the three labs slammed lighter nuclei into one another and looked for radioactive decays that should come from the new elements Ununtrium and ununpentium are thought to be metals Ununseptium could be a metalloid The fourth element ununoctium may be a gas like other elements helium neon and argon It is hard to know for sure because so few atoms of each element have ever been made Paul Karol chair of the IUPAC panel that verified the elements said It will be a long time before we can find practical uses for the new elements,train,ELE,INT
143,You probably know a vaper someone who smokes ecigarettes But has vaping started to become less popular Statistics suggest that smokers and recent exsmokers the majority of vapers may already be using ecigarettes less The big ecigarette companies will study the figures carefully because they have spent millions of pounds on a technology that they thought was becoming more popular Ecigarettes do not contain tobacco and produce vapour not smoke In 2014 the health charity Action on Smoking and Health published figures that showed that the number of British users of electronic cigarettes has increased three times from 700000 users in 2012 to 21 million in 2014 But figures from the Smoking Toolkit Study show vaping may be becoming less popular The number of vapers who are smokers and ex smokers rose until the end of 2013 when 22 of smokers and exsmokers were vaping But this percentage stopped rising in 2014 Then it dropped to 19 at the end of the year Professor Robert West who collected the data for the Toolkit described the figures as statistically important Smokers are the key group for ecigarette companies because seven out of ten vapers are smokers Only around 1 of people who have never smoked have tried an electronic cigarette The number of people who use ecigarettes while continuing to smoke is going down West said Weve only been studying vaping for just over a year so its a short time period but we are not seeing growth in the number of longterm exsmokers or never smokers using ecigarettes The number of people vaping might change but at the moment it looks like its staying the same Experts believe that vaping will probably not become fashionable with young nonsmokers Only 18 of children are regular ecigarette users But ecigarettes seem to be most popular with adults who want to quit The figures published this month show that the use of electronic cigarettes by smokers has stopped rising But the figures also show the huge increase in use since May 2011 said James Dunworth of ecigarettedirectcouk Our customers are still very happy with the product and technology is improving their experience and helping them to switch from traditional cigarettes Ecigarettes are like a sort of nicotine patch West agreed They are more popular than nicotine patches but we do not know if they are more effective Onethird of people who want to quit smoking use ecigarettes They are the most popular method of stopping The European Commission EC wants to increase taxes on ecigarettes which could make them less popular A new EC tobacco directive becomes law in 2016 It will limit the amount of nicotine in ecigarettes to below their current levels This may mean vapers will have to increase the number they smoke to get the same effect This is another thing that may make ecigarettes more expensive West suggested that politicians should see ecigarettes as something that helps people stop smoking He doesnt think they should follow the same laws as smoking Some local authorities and organizations treat ecigarettes like cigarettes they ban them in public places and outdoors he said He thinks we should support vapers not attack them,We often see our colleagues and friends smoking an ecigarette But has vaping started to become less popular Statistics suggest that vaping among smokers and recent exsmokers who are the vast majority of vapers may already be declining The gures will be studied closely by the major ecigarette companies which have put millions of pounds into a technology that they thought was growing in popularity Figures released in 2014 by the health charity Action on Smoking and Health ASH reveal that usage among adults in Britain of electronic cigarettes which do not contain tobacco and produce vapour not smoke has tripled from 700000 users in 2012 to 21 million in 2014 However gures collated by the Smoking Toolkit Study a research organization that provides quarterly updates on smoking trends show vapings appeal may be declining Vaping rates among smokers and exsmokers rose steadily until the end of 2013 when 22 of smokers and exsmokers were vaping But this proportion stopped rising in 2014 before dropping to 19 during the nal quarter of the year The drop is described as statistically signi cant by Professor Robert West who collates the gures for the Toolkit Smokers are the key group for ecigarette companies because seven out of ten vapers are smokers Only around 1 of people who have never smoked have tried an electronic cigarette Numbers who use ecigarettes while continuing to smoke are going down West said Weve only been studying vaping for just over a year so its a short time period but we are not seeing growth in the number of longterm exsmokers or never smokers using ecigarettes Vaping rates might change but at this stage it looks like theyre staying the same The fact that vaping has stopped growing in popularity in the UK seems to be at odds with what is happening in the US where the technology has been promoted aggressively and where reports suggest it is growing in popularity However West questioned the interpretation of US data which made little distinction between people who had once tried an ecigarette and those who regularly vaped Experts believe it is unlikely that vaping will become fashionable among young nonsmokers Only 18 of children are regular users the ASH study found Instead ecigarettes seem to be most popular among adults who want to quit While the gures published this month by Smoking In England show that the use of electronic cigarettes by smokers has stopped rising their data also shows the huge increase in use since May 2011 said James Dunworth of ecigarettedirectcouk Our customers are still very happy with the product and technology and innovation in hardware is improving user experience and helping them to switch from traditional cigarettes Ecigarettes behave like a sort of nicotine patch West agreed They are more popular than nicotine patches and may or may not be more effective Onethird of quit attempts use ecigarettes which makes them by far the most popular method of stopping Hazel Cheeseman director of policy at ASH said it was too soon to say whether vaping had peaked Although there are indications that the market hasnt grown in the UK for about a year there doesnt seem to be a decline in the number of people using electronic cigarettes to help them quit smoking The European Commission EC is looking at increasing taxes on ecigarettes which could have an impact on their popularity A new EC tobacco directive comes into force in 2016 that will limit the amount of nicotine in ecigarettes to below their current levels This may mean vapers will have to increase their usage to get the same effect again something that may make ecigarettes more expensive West suggested that policymakers should see ecigarettes as an aid to stopping smoking and not have the same regulations for them as for smoking There is a tendency among some local authorities and organizations to treat ecigarettes as cigarettes and ban them in public places and outdoors he said It just sounds like youre having a go at vapers and that undermines the public health messages were trying to get out We have to be careful not to stigmatize ecigarettes,train,ELE,INT

biological child back the other refuses to hand back the girl she has raised as her own daughter Henk Strydom a lawyer for one of the mothers said the switch was a tragedy that will probably not have a happy ending Both mothers gave birth at the Tambo Memorial Hospital in Boksburg east of Johannesburg on the same day in 2010 In 2013 one of the mothers who is 33 and unemployed wanted her expartner to pay maintenance for her daughter The man said he was not the father Strydom says A DNA test was done They found that it was not his baby and not her baby She was devastated She didnt know what to do She met the other mother and now they go to joint counselling sessions organized by the hospital Here both mothers met their biological daughters Strydom said about the mother You can see its not easy for her She has to care for a child that is not hers on her own while her child is with someone else The woman became unhappy and asked the childrens court to give her custody of her biological child but the other mother refused Its a tragedy She wants the baby back but its four years later you can understand that the other mother doesnt want to give up her baby Strydom said The High Court in Pretoria has asked the University of Pretorias Centre for Child Law to find out what will be best for the children Strydom added Whatever happens someone wont be happy Karabo Ngidi a lawyer with the centre said We must do what is best for the children Biology is important but it is not the only important thing It is not the first time babies have been switched by mistake in South Africa In 1995 two mothers were paid damages after their sons born in 1989 were switched by mistake at the Johannesburg hospital where they were born,Two mothers in South Africa have found out that they are raising each others daughters after they were mistakenly switched at birth in a hospital in 2010 But while one of the women wants to correct the error and get her biological child back the other is refusing to give back the girl she has raised as her own Henk Strydom a lawyer for one of the mothers described the swap as a travesty and tragedy that is unlikely to have a happy ending Both mothers gave birth at the Tambo Memorial Hospital in Boksburg east of Johannesburg on the same day in 2010 Nobody suspected anything Strydom said But in 2013 one of the mothers who is 33 and unemployed sued her expartner for maintenance for her daughter Strydom said The man denied he was the father A DNA test was done and it was found it was not his baby and not her baby She was devastated She didnt know what to do Eventually she met the other mother and since December 2013 they have been attending joint counselling sessions arranged by the hospital Here they have met their biological daughters Strydom said of his client She said there are resemblances to herself She told me that it was traumatic You can see its not easy for her She has to care for a child that is not hers on her own while her child is with someone else The woman became unhappy with the process and asked the childrens court to give her custody of her biological child but the other mother refused Its a tragedy She wants the baby back but its four years later you can understand that the other mother doesnt want to give up her baby Strydom said The High Court in Pretoria has asked the University of Pretorias Centre for Child Law to investigate what will now be in the best interests of the children Strydom added I dont know what the court will decide Your guess is as good as mine But whatever happens someone wont be happy He said at this point he and his client do not want to sue the hospital or government health department which is helping with the case and providing counselling The Centre for Child Law will interview the mothers and fathers as well as any other person with a significant relationship with either of the girls The children and mothers will have clinical assessments and may be seen by a psychologist Karabo Ngidi a lawyer with the centre said Whats going to happen must be in the best interests of the children Biology is an important aspect but not the only one The families are of Zulu ethnicity and so Zulu tradition culture and customary law will be a factor she added It is also still possible the ex partner of the mother who is taking legal action could be the biological father of the girl who was switched It is not the first childswap case in South Africa In 1995 two mothers were awarded damages after their sons born in 1989 were accidentally switched at the Johannesburg

162,Robert Mysajek stops Between two paw prints on a mountain path the scientist nds what he is looking for Droppings he says happily It is so rare to see a wolf that seeing droppings makes it a good day But it is getting easier to see a wolf There are now about 1500 wolves in Poland The number has doubled in 15 years The wolf the brown bear the lynx and the wolverine are Europes last large predator carnivores Scientists from Britain Germany and the Netherlands are coming here to nd out how the country has saved wolves who have a bad reputation even in fairy tales Bits of bone and hair stick out from the droppings It ate a red deer says Myslajek I can tell you all about this wolf what it eats if its a male or female its sexual habits age health and family connections DNA tests have shown that Polish wolves are travellers One wolf walked to the Netherlands where it was hit by a car They travel very far They need space The average territory of a Polish pack is 250 square kilometres said Mysajek The scientist says wolves can move up to 30 kilometres during a single hunt The pack that he is tracking is a strong group of eight or nine animals This year we have recorded ve cubs two young wolves and two adults We follow them using special cameras in the forest and by following their prints in the mud and snow In each family group only one pair of adults has cubs each year All the wolves in the pack look after the young Mysajek the son of a shepherd doesnt understand wolves bad reputation Why did we have to have the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood with its big bad wolf He is fascinated by these animals who remained in the wild 33000 years ago when other types of dog decided on a much more comfortable life as pets Mysajek says only the need to save forests and control the wild animal population can save Europes wild carnivores especially the unpopular wolf Natural predators balance the ecosystem They reduce the number of herbivores which allows trees to grow tall for birds to nest in The ban on wolf hunting in the western Carpathian mountains became law in 1995 and in the whole of Poland in 1998 There are now wolf packs in nearly all the countrys major forests where the wolves exist together with humans The Polish government pays compensation to farmers when a wolf kills their farm animals Mysajek tells farmers to put up electric fences He also tells them to use two things that wolves nd scary strings of small red ags to keep wolves away from sheep and the Tatra Mountain Sheepdog Poland didnt have many big roads until recently and this has helped wolves In 1989 when the communists left power Poland had only one motorway Big road projects began after Poland joined the European Union in 2004 and they now have to consider wild animals The way people think about wolves has also changed For many years hunting was a part of life in Poland In 1975 there were fewer than 100 wolves in Poland Mysajek says that Polish wolves are much safer now but they are not completely safe Packs go into neighbouring countries Russia Lithuania Belarus Ukraine and Slovakia where there is still hunting He says Polands new government doesnt like wolves The Environment Minister Jan Szyszko is a hunter There are 120000 hunters in Poland and they have a lot of in uence Its not easy to defend wolves You cant say to the politicians that wolves are a big tourist attraction Most tourists want to see the animals but wolves stay away from humans They have a very strong sense of smell,Robert Mysajek stops Between two paw prints on a muddy mountain track

travellers One wolf reached the Netherlands where unfortunately it was hit by a car They have a very big range They need space The average territory required by a Polish pack is 250 square kilometres says Mysajek Can we ever reintroduce wolves to Scotland asks student Alex Entwisle 23 on a study trip to southern Poland from the UK He and other animal science students have spent the day looking for droppings and paw prints in the Beskidy mountains of the Polish Carpathians Their hot discussion topic is whether to reintroduce wolves to the British Isles for the rst time since the 18th century Mysajek toured the Scottish Highlands in 2015 for the Wolves and Humans Foundation and answered questions from villagers about the Polish experience The big difference between Scotland and Poland is that we eat pork We do not have many sheep here The similarity is that we have a lot of animals 300000 red deer and more than 800000 roe deer In Poland we also have too many wild boar about 200000 and these are eating and destroying farmers cereal crops Here wolves are part of the solution he says The scientist says wolves can move up to 30 kilometres during a single hunt The Beskidy pack is a

Mysajek advises farmers to put up electric fences He has helped bring back the use of two deterrents that for reasons no one understands wolves nd very scary strings of small red ags that you hang around sheep pens and the Tatra Mountain Sheepdog Polands wolves have been helped by the countrys late infrastructure development In 1989 when the communists left power Poland had only one motorway Major road projects began after Poland joined the European Union in 2004 and they are required to consider wild animals Attitudes have also changed For many years hunting was cultural In 1975 there were fewer than 100 wolves in Poland From the 1950s hunting wolves was encouraged by the authorities They paid a reward for killing a wolf worth a months salary It was carnage Mysajek says that Polish wolves are much safer now but they are not completely safe Packs of wolves cross country borders and hunting still happens in neighbouring Russia Lithuania Belarus Ukraine and Slovakia He says Polands

advocate is not easy You cant argue to the politicians that wolves are a big tourist attraction Most tourists want to see the animals but wolves stay away from humans They have a very sensitive sense

178,Scientists have made an atlas of the brain It shows how the meanings of words are organized in different regions of the brain The atlas uses rainbow colours to show how words and their meanings are grouped together in areas of the brain We wanted to build a giant atlas that shows how the meanings of words are represented in the brain said Jack Gallant a neuroscientist at the University of California Berkeley No single brain region contains one word or idea A single brain spot contains a number of related words And each single word appears in many different brain spots Together they form networks that represent the meanings of each word we use life and love death and taxes All have their own networks The atlas shows how modern imaging can completely change what we know about how the brain does some of its most important tasks With further work the technology could have an enormous effect on medicine and other areas of study It is possible that we could use this technology to decode information about what words a person is hearing reading or possibly even thinking said Alexander Huth the main author of the study One possible use would be a language decoder that could allow people who cant talk because they have a serious illness to speak through a computer To make the atlas the scientists recorded peoples brain activity while they listened to stories Then they matched the transcripts of the stories with the brain activity data to show how groups of related words produced 50000 to 80000 responses all over the brain Huth used short interesting stories The stories had to be interesting so that the people in the experiment would listen to the words and not fall asleep Seven people listened to two hours of stories each Each person heard about 25000 words and more than 3000 different words as they lay in the scanner The atlas shows how words and related terms use the same regions of the brain For example on the lefthand side of the brain above the ear is one of the tiny regions that represents the word victim The same region responds to killed and murdered On the brains righthand side near the top of the head is one of the brain spots used for family terms wife husband children parents Each word is represented by more than one spot because words often have many meanings One part of the brain for example is used for the word top and also for other words that describe clothes But the word top also uses many other regions One of them is for numbers and measurements another for buildings and places Interestingly the brain atlases were similar for all the people in the experiment This suggests that their brains organized the meanings of words in the same way But the scientists only scanned ve men and two women All are native English speakers It is highly possible that people from different backgrounds and cultures will have different brain atlases Lorraine Tyler a neuroscientist and head of the Centre for Speech Language and the Brain at Cambridge University said the research was a great achievement But at the moment the brain atlas does not show small differences in word meanings This research is amazing and new there is still a lot to learn about how the meaning of words is represented in the brain,Scientists have created an atlas of the brain that shows how the meanings of words are arranged across different regions of the brain The atlas shows in rainbow colours how individual words and their meanings can be grouped together in areas of the brain Our goal was to build a giant atlas that shows how one speci c aspect of language is represented in the brain in this case semantics the meanings of words said Jack Gallant a neuroscientist at the University of California Berkeley No single brain region holds one word or concept A single brain spot is associated with a number of related words And each single word lights up many different brain spots Together they make up networks that represent the meanings of each word we use life and love death and taxes All light up their own networks The atlas was described as a great achievement by one researcher who was not involved in the study The atlas shows how modern imaging can transform our knowledge of how the brain does some of its most important tasks If scientists make further advances the technology could have an enormous impact on medicine and other areas of study It is possible that this approach could be used to decode information about what words a person is hearing reading or possibly even thinking said Alexander Huth the main author of the study

80000 peasized spots all over the cerebral cortex Huth used short compelling stories The stories had to be interesting so that the people in the experiment would focus on the words and not drift off Seven people listened to two hours of stories each Per person that was a total of about 25000 words and more than 3000 different words as they lay in the scanner The atlas shows how words and related terms light up the same regions of the brain For example on the lefthand side of the brain above the ear is one of the tiny regions that represents the word victim The same region responds to killed convicted murdered and confessed On the brains righthand side near the top of the head is one of the brain spots activated by family terms wife husband children parents Each word is represented by more than one spot because words often have several meanings One part of the brain for example responds to the word top as well as other words that describe clothing But the word top lights up many other regions One of them responds to numbers and measurements another to buildings and places The scientists have created an interactive website where the public can explore the brain atlas Interestingly the brain atlases were similar for all the people in the experiment This suggests that their brains organized the meanings of words in the same way The scientists only scanned ve men and two women however All are native English speakers It is highly possible that people from different backgrounds and cultures will have different semantic brain atlases Using the atlas researchers can now piece together the brain networks that represent very different concepts from numbers to murder and religion The idea of murder is represented a lot in the brain Gallant said Uri Hasson a neuroscientist at Princeton University said the work was great He said that many studies just looked at brain activity when a single word or sentence was spoken but Gallants team had shed light on how the brain worked in a realworld scenario The next step he said was to create a more complete and precise semantic brain atlas In the future Hasson believes it will be possible to reconstruct the words a person is thinking from their brain activity The ethical implications are enormous Lorraine Tyler a neuroscientist and head of the Centre for Speech Language and the Brain at Cambridge University said the research was a great achievement But the brain atlas in its current form does not show small differences in word meanings This research is Centre for Speech Language and the Brain at

One person called the event on 21 June a mix of cultural nationalism and commercialization Others however talk about a recent US court ruling that said yoga was not always linked to religion A court in California ruled that The practice of yoga may be religious in some contexts but yoga classes as taught in the San Diego district are not religious mystical or spiritual This ruling came after two

characters in his books practise yoga In ancient India yoga was part of daily life both the physical and the mental aspects Every culture has gifted something to the world and this is our gift

39,The last time she performed we did not have mobile phones Now 35 years later as she performs again singer Kate Bush sees a very different world These days most concerts are now lit up with phones and tablets but Bush does not want her fans to watch her shows through a screen In August before her concerts at the Hammersmith Apollo in London Bush asked her fans to put down their mobile phones at her gigs Bush wrote on her website I have a request for all of you who are coming to the shows We have chosen a theatre not a large venue or stadium Please do not take photos or videos during the shows I very much want to have contact with you as an audience not with iPhones iPads or cameras Bush is not the first singer or musician to say she doesnt like phones at concerts Roger Daltrey from The Who recently said it was weird that people looked at their screen and not the artist on stage He said I feel sorry for them I really feel sorry for them Looking at life through a screen and not being in the moment totally if youre doing that youre 50 there right Its weird In 2013 Beyonc told a fan You cant even sing because youre too busy filming Put that damn camera down Recently Dutch football fans at PSV Eindhoven protested against the introduction of wifi in their stadium They held up banners that said No wifi Support the team and You can sit at home Manchester United have also told fans to leave their large electronic devices at home Singer Jarvis Cocker said It seems stupid to have something happening in front of you and look at it on a screen thats smaller than a cigarette packet Even in the world of classical music one of the worlds top pianists surprised the audience in June 2013 when he left the stage because a fan was filming his performance on a smartphone Krystian Zimerman returned moments later and said The destruction of music because of YouTube is enormous But Sam Watt says that filming at concerts makes the experience even better He works for Vyclone a phone app that puts together many videos uploaded by fans to create one long video of a show Fans filming is now part of the concert experience that is a just a fact We take the videos that people are filming at concerts and mix them together with everybody else who was filming The result is a really fantastic video he said We think that filming at concerts adds to the experience and I think that if Kate Bush came round for a cup of tea we could have a really interesting discussion about this he added People are going to film and they want those memories youve got to accept it,The last time she went on stage the mobile phone was having its first trials Thirtyfive years later as she performs once again singer Kate Bush is faced with a different world While most concerts are now aglow with phones and tablets Bush does not want her fans watching her shows through a screen Before her highly anticipated series of concerts at the Hammersmith Apollo in London Bush released a statement asking her fans to put down their mobile phones at her gigs Bush wrote on her website I have a request for all of you who are coming to the shows We have purposefully chosen an intimate theatre setting rather than a large venue or stadium It would mean a great deal to me if you would please refrain from taking photos or filming during the shows I very much want to have contact with you as an audience not with iPhones iPads or cameras I know its a lot to ask but it would allow us to all share in the experience together With her love of theatrics and opulent costumes Bushs keenness to stop fans uploading footage to YouTube could also be an attempt to keep the show a surprise for the thousands of fans who have bought tickets for the 22 dates she is playing Bush is not the first singer or musician to speak out against the effect of phones at concerts The Who front man Roger Daltrey recently said it was weird that people did not have their mind on the show when they had gone to a performance and were concentrating on staring at the screen rather than the artist on stage He said I feel sorry for them I really feel sorry for them Looking at life through a screen and not being in the moment totally if youre doing that youre 50 there right Its weird I find it weird In 2013 Beyonc berated one her fans at a gig for filming You cant even sing because youre too busy filming Beyonc told him You gotta seize this moment Put that damn camera down The debate around phones at live events is not restricted to music Recently Dutch football fans at PSV Eindhoven protested against the introduction of wifi in their stadium holding up banners with messages like No wifi Support the team You can sit at home and Stand united while Manchester United have also told fans to leave their large electronic devices at home Jarvis Cocker has also criticized fans with phones in the audience he says they drive him insane at concerts adding It seems stupid to have something happening in front of you and look at it on a screen thats smaller than a cigarette packet Johnny Marr said in 2013 that it meant that fans missed out on the sensory experience of live music in their desperation to film the event for later To stand and just be looking at it through your phone is a completely wasted opportunity You know I dont mean to be unkind but I think you should put your phone down because youre just being an idiot really Just enjoy the gig he said Even in the world of classical music one of the worlds leading pianists surprised concertgoers in June 2013 when he stormed off stage because a fan was filming his performance on a smartphone Krystian Zimerman returned moments later and said The destruction of music because of YouTube is enormous But Sam Watt of Vyclone a phone app that encourages audiences to film at concerts and then brings together the footage to create a crowdsourced video of the event said that filming at concerts enhanced the experience Fans filming is now part of the concert experience that is a just a fact so we take the footage that people are filming at concerts and then it comes back to them mixed together with everybody else who was filming You end up with really fantastic content he said Our thinking is that filming at concerts adds to the experience rather than taking away from it and I think if Kate Bush came round for a cup of tea we could have a really interesting discussion about this he added Knowing that people are going to film and want those memories is really important Youve got to embrace it,train,ELE,INT
109,The view from the visitors centre in the Donana National Park in southern Spain is a bird watchers dream 200000 hectares of wetlands vital for the birds of western Europe Many of Britains most loved migratory birds rest here every year on their migrations from Africa Donana is also home to some of Europes rarest birds including the Spanish imperial eagle It is a beautiful landscape but it is under threat In 1998 almost two billion gallons of toxic water full of acid and waste metals poured into the park from the Los Frailes mine 45km away They collected more than 25000 kilos of dead sh afterwards and nearly 2000 adult birds chicks eggs and nests were killed or destroyed It was Spains worst environmental disaster and the cleanup cost 90 million Spain realized that Donana is the nations most important natural site so the country decided to spend an extra 360 million on restoring the landscape to its original wetland state It has been an expensive process And Donana is still under threat from the pressures of modern life There are plans to build an oil pipeline through Donana and there is also an idea to build new hotels and golf courses which would use a lot of local water Sand and soil washed from nearby farms is also blocking the channels that cross the park But the biggest shock has been the recent decision of the Andalucian government to reopen the Frailes mine that nearly destroyed Donana in 1998 This is Europes most important bird sanctuary says Laurence Rose of the RSPB Royal Society for the Protection of Birds Donana already faces a lot of threats but now they want to bring back the cause of the disaster 16 years ago It is extremely worrying If you look at the state of the local economy you quickly see why the government has made this decision The crash of Spains banks in 2008 had a very bad effect on the region Unemployment in some parts of Andalucia is now more than 30 If they reopen the mine it would create more than 1000 jobs There are riches here riches that the local inhabitants badly need said energy spokesman Vicente Fernandez Guerrero We think mining is a good way to make it possible to allow local people to continue to live in the area This is a mining area People have mined metals here since Roman times Fernandez said that the mine licence would only allow modern mining techniques which do not create poisonous wet waste They will use the best technology in the world here Fernandez said They will not use liquid We will not allow that Some people agree with the idea but a lot of people disagree with it Carlos Davila who works for the Spanish Ornithological Society in Donana was also alarmed at the idea This is a very very bad idea he said They say the new mine will be safe but they said it was safe in 1998 and look what happened We got the worst ecological disaster in the history of Spain Almost every visitor at a local restaurant had a camera and telescopic lens or a pair of binoculars Lots of tourists come to Donana because of the birdlife This is not surprising for this is a truly special place A big sky hangs over this at but dramatic landscape Birds of every shape and size ll the air and sometimes the road At one point on my visit a stork calmly stood in front of our car until it felt ready to y off The trouble is that Spain does not have the public resources it had 16 years ago A repeat of the disaster today would have a much much more damaging impact said Rose Davila agrees After the disaster Spain realized that it had a place of real ecological importance and did a lot to clean it up and protect it he added Now it seems we have forgotten that lesson It is very depressing,The view from the visitors centre at the southern edge of Donana National Park in southern Spain is an ornithologists dream 200000 hectares of wetlands vital for the birdlife of western Europe Dozens of Britains most loved migratory birds rest here every year on their migrations from Africa Donana is also home to some of Europes rarest birds including the Spanish imperial eagle It is a glorious vibrant landscape but it exists on a knifeedge In 1998 almost two billion gallons of acidic water mixed with waste metals poured into the park from the Los Frailes mine 45km away A toxic tsunami of waste poured down the Guadiamar river into the park More than 25000 kilos of dead sh were collected afterwards and nearly 2000 adult birds chicks eggs and nests were killed or destroyed It was Spains worst environmental disaster and the cleanup cost 90m Suddenly aware of Donanas status as the nations most important natural site Spain decided to spend a further 360m some of it EU money on restoring the landscape In the 1950s and 60s some parts of this landscape had been drained to create rice and cotton elds Some of this farmland is now being returned to its original wetland state It has been a costly but positive process But Donana is still in trouble thanks to the increasing pressures of modern life There are plans to build an oil pipeline through Donana and other developers want to build new hotels and golf courses which would need enormous water supplies Sand and soil washed from nearby farms is also blocking the channels that cross Donana However the real body blow for conservationists has been the recent decision of the Andalucian government to reopen the Frailes mine that nearly destroyed Donana in 1998 This is Europes most precious bird sanctuary for indigenous species and also as a resting place for birds that migrate between Africa and Britain and other parts of northwest Europe says Laurence Rose of the RSPB Royal Society for the Protection of Birds Donana already faces a large number of threats but now they want to bring back the very cause of the disaster 16 years ago It is extremely worrying The state of the local economy provides an explanation for the governments decision The crash of Spains banks in 2008 had a catastrophic effect on the region and unemployment in some parts of Andalucia is now more than 30 Reopening the mine would provide more than 1000 jobs There are riches here riches that are badly needed by local inhabitants said energy spokesman Vicente Fernandez Guerrero We think mining is a good way to make it possible to allow local people to continue to live in the area This is a mining area People have been digging metals here since Roman times Fernandez said that the mine licence would only allow modern mining techniques which avoid the creation of poisonous wet waste Also the Canadian company that ran Los Frailes when the disaster happened cannot run it again The best technology in the world will be used here Fernandez insisted Liquid will not be used We are going to insist on that The plan has some support in the area but it also has a lot of opposition Carlos Davila who works for the Spanish Ornithological Society in Donana was also alarmed at the plan This is a very very bad idea he said They say the new mine will be safe but they said it was safe in 1998 and look what happened We got the worst ecological disaster in the history of Spain Almost every visitor at a local restaurant had a camera and telescopic lens or a pair of binoculars There is a big tourist trade because of the birdlife of Donana This is not surprising because this is a very special place A huge sky hangs over this

trouble is that Spain does not have the public resources it had 16 years ago A repeat of the toxin spill today would have a much much more damaging impact said Rose This point is supported by Davila

28,In summer in the Arctic regions of Canada the sun shines for more than 20 hours a day Some people enjoy this after the constant darkness of winter But for the small Muslim community of Iqaluit life in the land of the midnight sun is a real challenge during the month of Ramadan when Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset I havent fainted once said 29yearold Abdul Karim one of only a few Muslims in the area who has carefully timed his Ramadan fast to the Arctic sun This year that means he eats at about 130am before the sun rises and breaks his fast at about 11pm when the sun sets I would only stop if it hurt my health Karim said Most Muslims in Iqaluit follow the timetable that Muslims in Ottawa about 1300 miles south follow This follows the advice of Muslim scholars who have said Muslims in the far north should observe Ramadan using the timetable of Mecca or the nearest Muslim city They still have to fast for around 18 hours a day said Atif Jilani who moved to Iqaluit from Toronto The days are long but we can do it Its a similar situation in all of Canadas most northern mosques during Ramadan where Muslims have to live with very long or very short days In recent years much of the community has chosen to follow the Ramadan timetable of Edmonton in Alberta Some follow the timetable of Mecca for example Awan a father of two young children including a 12yearold who recently started fasting He hopes that the easier timetable will encourage his son it means about 15 hours of fasting not 18 hours like in Edmonton If I fast Edmonton times my son might say Papa you are really insane What are you doing he said For the 100 Muslims in Inuvik a small town 125 miles north of the Arctic Circle it is impossible to follow the local movements of the sun They also follow Edmontons timetable We currently have 24 hours a day of sun said Ahmad Alkhalaf Theres no sunrise or sunset People already followed the Edmonton timetable in 2001 when he moved from Toronto to the small northern town of 3500 people My first Ramadan here was in December Theres no sun at that time its dark all day and night So we used Edmonton time Sometimes it can be difficult to follow the clock and not the sun Alkhalaf said We should break our fast when its dusk but we eat when the sun is up Its not usual to have iftar the meal that breaks the fast when the sun is up he said In Inuvik where most of the population is Inuit the Muslim community has tried to find a balance between Ramadan and the local culture and traditions The iftar meal includes curries and also local meat such as reindeer We make a soup or curry but we dont use beef we use reindeer In Iqaluit this Ramadan has been one of the most difficult of recent years because it includes some of the longest days of the year Its particularly true for people like Karim who have followed the local sunrise and sunset carefully But it will be easier for him to fast in future years he says thanks to the lunar calendar Ramadan will then fall during winter and in Iqaluit the sun will rise and set within a few hours each day Ill follow those hours too he said with a laugh Oh yes,In the Arctic regions of Canada the summer sun shines for more than 20 hours a day For some its a welcome change from the constant darkness of winter But for the small but growing Muslim community of Iqaluit Nunavut life in the land of the midnight sun is a real challenge during the month of Ramadan when Muslims typically fast from sunrise to sunset I havent fainted once said 29yearold Abdul Karim one of the few in the area who has carefully timed his Ramadan fast to the Arctic sun since moving from Ottawa in 2011 This year that means eating at about 130am before the sun rises and breaking his fast at about 11pm when the sun sets The only reason to stop would be if it hurts my health Karim said It is nearly the end of Ramadan for Muslims around the world Fasting is important but during the holy month in every Muslim community there is also a focus on community work prayer and reflection But in Iqaluit and the other Muslim communities in the Arctic the long days have forced a change in how they fast Most Muslims in Iqaluit follow the timetable followed by Muslims in Ottawa about 1300 miles south this follows the advice of Muslim scholars who have said Muslims in the far north should observe Ramadan using the timetable of Mecca or the nearest Muslim city It still means fasting for around 18 hours a day said Atif Jilani who moved to Iqaluit from Toronto The days are long but its more manageable Many in the community of 100 people break their fast together they gather in the citys brand new mosque for nightly suppers As they tuck into traditional food such as dates and goat or lamb curries the sun shines brightly through the windows Its a similar situation across Canadas most northern mosques during Ramadan as Muslims deal with the countrys unique geography In recent years much of the community has chosen to follow the Ramadan timetable of Edmonton in Alberta Some follow the timings of Mecca for example Awan a father of two young children including a 12yearold who recently started fasting He hopes to encourage his son with the more manageable timetable of about 15 hours of fasting compared with about 18 hours in Edmonton If I fast Edmonton times my son might say Papa you are really insane

Edmontons timetable We currently have 24 hours a day of sun said Ahmad Alkhalaf Theres no sunrise or sunset They were already following the Edmonton schedule in 2001 when he moved from Toronto to the small northern community of 3500 people My first Ramadan here was in December Theres no sun at that time its dark all day and night So we used Edmonton time At times it can be difficult to follow the clock rather than what is happening outside Alkhalaf said Youre supposed to break your fast when its dusk but we eat when the sun is up Its not usual to have iftar the meal that breaks the fast when the sun is up he said In Inuvik where most of the population is Inuit the Muslim community has tried to strike a balance between Ramadan and the local culture and traditions The iftar meal includes dates and curries as well as local game such as reindeer We make a soup or curry but instead of using beef we use reindeer In Iqaluit as the Muslim community prepares to mark the end of Ramadan some reflect that 2016s timing stretching across some of the longest days of the year has made it one of the more difficult of recent years Its particularly true for those like Karim who have followed the local sunrise and sunset carefully But his efforts will be rewarded in future years said Karim thanks to the lunar calendar Ramadan will eventually fall during winter and in Iqaluit the sun will rise

173,Women have traditionally had a minor role in professional football but this may be changing France has just employed its first female professional team manager It did not matter that it was a seconddivision club It did not matter if it was as some people suggested just a publicity stunt for a minor team Clermont Foot 63 Clermont is 14th out of the 20 teams in its league at the moment What mattered was that they gave Helena Costa the top job This has made football history because she is the first female manager in the top two divisions of any professional European league As a woman its made me happy said Vronique Soulier president of the clubs supporters association When I first heard the news I was surprised but then we all agreed that its good news We all agree that a woman at the head of a group of men is no bad thing The new manager of Clermont Foot 63 was born in Alhandra Portugal and has a masters degree in sports science She is also a UEFAlicensed coach She previously coached Benficas male youth teams the Qatar womens team and more recently the Iranian womens national team The president of Clermont Foot 63 Claude Michy gave Costa 36 a twoyear contract Michy is very good at keeping his club in the news In 2013 he told everyone the team had signed Messi They had Not the Argentinian and Barcelona striker Lionel Messi but Junior Messi Enguene a 20yearold midfielder from Cameroon Carolina Morace an Italian who was the only previous woman coach of a mens professional team said I dont know Helena but if she has been hired by a team then it means that she knows how

the job because of a disagreement with the clubs owner She added I see too many men even in the womens game who do not have the same expertise as women but are working And the women are not working

a woman as my number two Michy did it first Clermont Foot 63 says that Costas becoming the teams manager will allow the club to enter a new era On the club supporters website reaction to Costas becoming the manager was mixed In my opinion its just a publicity stunt to get people talking about the club I find it hard to believe shell be able to get the players respect above all when shes the same age as the oldest wrote one fan Her CV isnt bad but now the question is will she be good enough added another A third wrote I wish her welcome and success but I think itll be hard for her to do well as a woman in such a macho business But Soulier was hopeful Hopefully with the new manager the club can find the motivation they dont have at the moment she said The boys in the team can be difficult to manage With a woman in control maybe they will be less demanding If we believe Costas reputation she will be the person making the demands After doing work experience at Chelsea during

60,In 2005 BlackBerry brought instant messaging to the mobile phone and the company was just entering its period of success Then the iPhone was still just an idea and BlackBerrys innovations made its smartphone one of Canadas biggest exports Six years later in the summer of 2011 there were riots in London and other UK cities Rioters used BlackBerry Messenger BBM and politicians wanted the service to shut down But two years later the users themselves are leaving BBM Fewer and fewer people want BlackBerry phones There are now many alternative products from Facebooks and Apples instant messaging applications to independent apps such as WhatsApp and Kik which is also Canadian They are free to download and use and they use the internet to swap text messages pictures voice clips stickers and even videos between most types of phones BBM is trying to keep its customers and you can now use it on Android and Apple phones There are many other apps people can use but lots of people want to use the BBM app more than 20 million people downloaded it But many people believe BBM will not survive The move to bring BlackBerry to the iPhone is four or five years too late says James Gooderson a technology blogger WhatsApp has made BlackBerrys unnecessary for young people BBM says it has 80 million monthly users after its upgrade but WhatsApp has 300 million Other services show BBMs weaknesses Skype and Viber have video or voice calls but BBM doesnt Path does location sharing but BBM doesnt there is no video sharing as on iMessage and the stickers a more sophisticated version of the smiley face that kids around the world adore are also absent Even the contacts and calendar sharing that BBM made possible on BlackBerry phones are not on the Apple and Android versions Messaging is now becoming visual Photos that are uploaded to Instagram get instant comments and Snapchats pictures have opened a world of other possibilities Like BBM all of these services are free for any phone with an internet connection But in 2011 BBM was so powerful that it helped to start a revolution in Egypt and at the time of the London riots people used BBM not their televisions to find out quickly what was happening Nearly 80 of young smartphone owners regularly use a social networking application but twothirds use more than one 60 of 16 to 24yearolds use Facebook every day but 46 use alternatives Its much more complex says Benedict Evans a digital media specialist All of these apps use your smartphone Apps rise and fall like fireworks Some like Instagram last others just disappear Thirteenyearold Bennett has three phones He keeps his BlackBerry for messaging he uses an iPhone to play games and he makes phone calls on an Android phone His friends are still on BBM At the touch of a few buttons you can send a single BlackBerry message to several hundred people on WhatsApp the limit is 50 But for Bennett Instagram is now a major social network Instagram is Facebook without parents he says Facebook is now for older people The low cost of buying and using a BlackBerry is still an advantage Anyone with a secondhand phone and a 7amonth deal from a telecoms company can use unlimited BBM messages But people no longer trust the privacy of BBM Business people revolutionaries demonstrators and rioters used to believe that their messages were secret The arrests that followed the riots showed that wasnt true In the rich London district of South Kensington the older pupils at one school all have Apple phones They all use WhatsApp For many BBM is a distant memory I still have a Blackberry but Im the only one says one teenager And how does that make him feel Isolated he says,Back in 2005 when BlackBerry brought instant messaging to the mobile phone the company was just entering its boom times While the iPhone was still just an idea BlackBerrys innovations ensured its smartphone was one of Canadas biggest exports Six years later in the summer of 2011 when there were riots in London and other UK cities BlackBerry Messenger BBM was so effective at mobilizing the rioters that politicians wanted the service to be temporarily shut down But two years later it is the users themselves who are pulling the plug Demand for BlackBerry phones is falling Dozens of alternatives have sprung up to take its place from Facebooks and Apples instant messaging applications to independent apps such as WhatsApp and Kik which is also Canadian They are free to download and use and they use the internet to swap text messages pictures voice clips stickers and even videos between most types of phones In an attempt to keep its customers BBM has been released on Android and Apple phones Despite the competition from other apps the response has been extraordinary with more than 20 million downloads But despite this interest many people believe BBMs wider release will not save the service The move to bring BlackBerry to the iPhone is four or five years too late says James Gooderson an 18yearold student who blogs on technology WhatsApp has made BlackBerrys unnecessary for young people BBM says it has 80 million monthly users after its upgrade but WhatsApp has 300 million Other services show BBMs limitations unlike Skype and Viber it does not yet offer video or voice calls unlike Path it does not do location sharing there is no video sharing as on iMessage and the stickers a more sophisticated version of the smiley face adored by kids all over the world are also absent Even the contacts and calendar sharing that BBM made possible on BlackBerry phones are not on the Apple and Android versions Messaging is moving from verbal to visual Photos uploaded to Instagram get instant comments and Snapchats pictures which selfdelete after ten seconds have opened a world of other possibilities Like BBM all of these services are free for any phone with an internet connection But as recently as 2011 BBM was so powerful it helped to start a revolution in Egypt and at the time of the London riots it was a more immediate source of news than the television screen We could see on our BlackBerry messages where the rioters were going next TV news would catch up four hours later said Jean Pierre Moore 28 He manages a youth club in Stockwell south London an area with some of the highest levels of crime and poverty in Britain Moore mainly communicates on an iPad now He does not agree with the idea that a shutdown of BBM would have stopped the looting The social networking wasnt the reason he says Nearly 80 of young smartphone owners regularly use a social networking application but twothirds use more than one Among 16 to 24yearolds 60 use Facebook every day but 46 use alternatives Its a much more complex multifaceted environment says Benedict Evans a digital media specialist All of these apps use your smartphone they plug into your phone book and your photo library Apps rise and fall like fireworks Some like Instagram last others just disappear Thirteenyearold Bennett has three phones He keeps his BlackBerry for messaging uses an iPhone to play games and makes phone calls on an Android phone His friends are still on BBM At the touch of a few buttons a single BlackBerry message can be sent to the phone owners entire contacts book several hundred people in some cases on WhatsApp the limit for a broadcast message is 50 But for Bennett Instagram is now a major social network Instagram is Facebook without parents he says Facebook has been taken over by the older generation When I saw my mum on Facebook I deleted my account

104,Male bosses are paid bonuses double the size of bonuses given to female colleagues in the same jobs This means that men get bonuses of 141500 more than women over their working lives The numbers released by the Chartered Management Institute CMI show that men in UK management jobs earned average bonuses of 6442 in 2012 compared with 3029 for women Female directors received bonuses of 36270 over the past 12 months compared with 63700 received by male directors The numbers show that pay in British business is still not equal Campaigners believe we must do something to improve equality at work Ann Francke the CMIs chief executive said that there should be more flexibility and less masculine cultures and that the good work people do should be more important than how much time they spend in the office Also there should be more transparency around performance and bonuses If we solve this issue we will improve the performance of organizations and the wellbeing of people at work she said What are we waiting for Some of the numbers may be affected by women doing jobs where there is less of a culture of bonus payments But the differences in the sizes of bonuses do make Britains pay gap worse The government says the pay gap is closing but that fulltime male employees still earn 10 more than women Maria Miller the Minister for Women and Equalities said that the CMI numbers are another example from the world of work that shows that women still earn less than men doing the same job Changes in the workplace are happening and its good that the pay gap is closing but there is still more to do before we see full equality in the workplace The government is trying to help 120 companies have joined our Think Act Report scheme which encourages companies to improve the way they recruit promote and pay women Weve also looked at other causes of the pay gap such as having to juggle work and family Large companies such as Tesco BT Unilever and the international law firm Eversheds are some of the companies that have signed up to Think Act Report The scheme has only attracted 120 companies in nearly two years But the CMIs numbers also showed that the pay gap is closing the difference between the average salaries earned by male and female bosses appeared to be smaller than in 2012,Male bosses are paid bonuses double the size of those given to female colleagues in identical jobs This means that men get salary topups of 141500 more than women over their working lives The figures released by the Chartered Management Institute CMI reveal that men in UK management roles earned average bonuses of 6442 in 2012 compared with 3029 for women In the most senior roles female directors received bonuses of 36270 over the past 12 months compared with 63700 awarded to male directors The latest figures show that pay in British business is still not equal This has led to calls for action from campaigners on workplace equality Ann Francke the CMIs chief executive said Its time to move this issue into the mainstream management agenda This is about changing our approach to management There should be greater flexibility less masculine cultures more emphasis on outcomes rather than time in the office and greater transparency around performance and rewards In solving this issue we would actually raise the performance of organizations and the wellbeing of individuals at work What are we waiting for While some of the data may be affected by factors such as women doing jobs where there is less of a culture of bonus payments the differences in the sizes of bonuses do appear to make Britains pay gap worse The government says the pay gap is closing but that fulltime male employees still earn 10 more than women Maria Miller the Minister for Women and Equalities said The CMI figures are another example from the world of work showing that women still lose out to their male counterparts Changes in the workplace are happening and its good that the pay gap is closing but there is still more to do before we see full equality in the workplace The government is playing its part We have signed up 120 companies to our Think Act Report scheme which encourages companies to improve the way they recruit promote and pay women Weve also looked at other pay gap causes such as having to juggle work and family responsibilities We have introduced shared parental leave and the right to request flexible working to all employees Large companies such as Tesco BT Unilever and the international law firm Eversheds are among those signed up to Think Act Report The scheme has only attracted 120 supporters in nearly two years of existence However the CMIs data did provide some evidence to support Millers statement that the overall pay gap is narrowing the difference between the average salaries earned by male and female bosses appeared to shrink from 2012 A subset of 17000 individual managers whose salaries and bonuses have been followed over a number of years showed that male managers earnings are rising faster than womens for the first time in five years Mens earnings increased by 32 compared with a 28 increase for women when salaries and bonuses are combined At the most senior level male directors earnings rose by 53 over the past 12 months compared with just 11 for female directors,train,ELE,INT
118,A subway system has billions of inhabitants the bacteria of Swiss cheese and kimchi plague and human skin Now for the rst time scientists have started to study the bacteria in a citys subway and they have found many interesting results Dr Christopher Mason a scientist at Weill Cornell Medical College led a team that tested the New York City subway system for 18 months His team found meningitis at Times Square a trace of anthrax on a train carriage and bacteria that cause plague on a rubbish bin and ticket machine at stations in uptown Manhattan The team said the ndings of plague and anthrax are not serious They said that there was only a very small trace of anthrax that rats probably carried the plague and that no one has become ill with plague in New York for years The results do not show that people in New York are at risk the study says In fact most of the bacteria the team found are harmless to humans Some of the results were not a surprise They showed that people should wash their hands Mason said He also said that they found many bacteria that are helpful like the bacteria used for making cheese All around the subway there were bacteria from cheeses brie cheddar parmesan and the mozzarella found on New York pizza The bacteria of Swiss cheese were found in midtown Manhattan and the nancial district and the bacteria used to make kimchi and sauerkraut showed up in the nancial district and Bay Ridge Bacteria that can cause illness and infections were very common Bacteria that cause diarrhoea and nausea as well as Ecoli and the bacteria that can cause skin infections and urinarytract infections were common all over the city The scientists found bacteria that cause tetanus in Soho and bacteria that cause dysentery at a station in the Bronx and in Harlem Mason and his team collected more than 1000 samples from all of New Yorks 466 open subway stations They found 15152 different species nearly half of which were bacteria The good news they said is that these bacteria are not spreading sickness or disease in New York and that the subway and city are as safe as everyone thought In fact Mason added Ive become much more confident riding the subway Many ndings made sense stations like Grand Central and Times Square where there are more people had more bacteria The Bronx with its diverse neighbourhoods and stations had the greatest diversity of bacteria Staten Island with just three stops had the lowest diversity of bacteria The researchers found sea and sh bacteria at South Ferry a station that ooded during Hurricane Sandy The next steps Mason said are studies of other cities which have begun in Paris Sao Paolo and Shanghai They also want to do more studies of New York He said he hoped the research would help health of cials to prevent and track diseases,A subway system has billions of inhabitants the bacteria of Swiss cheese and kimchi bubonic plague and drugproof bugs and human skin Now for the rst time scientists have started to catalogue and map the bacteria in a citys subway and they have found many interesting results Dr Christopher Mason a geneticist at Weill Cornell Medical College led a team that for 18 months tested the New York City subway system for the microscopic life forms that cover its turnstiles seats ticket booths and stations His team found meningitis at Times Square a trace of anthrax on the handhold of a train carriage and bacteria that cause bubonic plague on a rubbish bin and ticket machine at stations in uptown Manhattan The team have strongly downplayed the ndings of plague and anthrax They say that there is only an extremely small trace of the latter that rats likely carried the former and that no one has fallen ill with plague in or around New York for years The results do not suggest that plague or anthrax is prevalent the study says Nor do they suggest that New York residents are at risk In fact most of the bacteria identi ed by the team are either harmless to humans or bene cial in the citys thriving world of microorganisms Some of the results were expected and should be a gentle reminder for people to wash their hands Mason said He also said that they found many bacteria of the same sort as those that are bene cial and helpful like the one used for making cheese Bacteria appeared to re ect the eating habits of various neighbourhoods All around the subway bacteria associated with cheeses brie cheddar parmesan and the mozzarella found on New York pizza appeared The distinctive bacteria of Swiss cheese were more limited to midtown Manhattan and the nancial district and the bacteria used to ferment cabbage for kimchi and sauerkraut showed up in the nancial district and Bay Ridge Bacteria associated with illness and infections were extremely common Species that cause diarrhoea and nausea as well as Ecoli and the bacteria that can cause skin infections and urinarytract infections were common all over the city The species that produces tetanus appeared in Soho and bacteria that cause dysentery appeared at a station in the Bronx and another in Harlem Mason and his team collected more than 1000 samples at all of New Yorks 466 open subway stations They put the organic materials through a DNA sequencer and then through a supercomputer They identi ed 15152 distinct species nearly half of which were bacteria The good news the researchers said is that these potentially infectious bacteria are not spreading sickness or disease throughout New York They seem to be normal cohabitants of a city In short the researchers conclude the subway and city are about as safe as everyone thought Mason said people should not be concerned about getting urinarytract infections from subway seats You should wash your hands he said and probably get some sleep eat salads and go to the gym and thats about the same today as it was yesterday In fact he added Ive become much more con dent riding the subway Many findings made sense stations like Grand Central and Times Square where there are more people had more bacteria and more diversity among them The Bronx with its diverse neighbourhoods and stations had the greatest diversity of bacteria Staten Island with just three stops had the lowest The researchers found marine bacteria at South Ferry a station that ooded during Hurricane Sandy but they were surprised to note the species included some normally associated with Antarctica and fish The next steps Mason said are studies of other cities which have begun in Paris Sao Paolo and Shanghai and continued studies of New York for instance to see how the results change with the seasons He said he hoped the research would provide a baseline of research for health of cials and geneticists and could help health of cials to prevent and track diseases and pathogens,train,ELE,INT

lot of people come here to see the sky now says a man who works for a local carhire company They come in autumn and winter when its darkest Its good for the local hotels because tourists come all year round now Wise agrees that Northumberland needs to do more to take advantage of its dark skies which are very rare He believes the region needs more observatories to make sure that visitors will see what they came for A new 14million national landscape discovery centre will have an observatory when it is completed in a couple of years Fildes has big ambitions He is planning Britains first astrovillage it would have the largest public observatory in the world a 100seat auditorium a 100seat planetarium and radiomagnetic and solar telescopes The multimillionpound project would also have a

helped TV programmes about astronomy have attracted a new generation of stargazers Technology has also made astronomy more popular Apps such as Stellarium now turn smartphones into pocketsize

78,If we dont win it doesnt mean anything said billionaire Donald Trump in South Carolina He hopes to be the Republican presidential nominee He is worried he might not win but he shouldnt be worried because he has been at the top of the opinion polls for four months I want to pick my date for the election I want it next Tuesday he told a crowd of 11000 people He needs their support to continue until March 2016 so he is chosen as the presidential candidate in November 2016s general election Strangely recent controversy has only made him more popular First he shocked prisoners of war when he said that he didnt believe Vietnam veteran John McCain was a hero because he allowed the enemy to capture him Then in the rst television debate he was rude to a woman who asked him dif cult questions Trump has also insulted Mexican immigrants to the US and said that a Black Lives Matter protester who was violently thrown out of a political meeting deserved to be attacked He seemed to laugh at a New York Times journalist for his disability and said Muslim Americans supported the 911 attackers Some people still hope that eventually even Trumps supporters will get tired of his attacks on minorities One poll shows his support among Republicans has reduced by 12 points although at 31 he is still winning Hes not a conservative hes not a liberal he believes in himself former presidential rival Bobby Jindal told the Guardian Trump tells his supporters that the three things that he is most against immigration reform free trade deals and Barack Obamas national security policy have become the most important issues of the election He believes that every undocumented immigrant in the US should be sent back to their country and he wants to ask Mexico to pay for a border wall A real wall A very tall wall taller than that ceiling This might not sound possible but these ideas have possibly destroyed the campaign hopes of Jeb Bush who wants immigration reform So what can stop Trump Often polls this far away from election day can be incorrect because most people have not made up their minds Among Americans who say they are Republicans current polls say that he has 2530 of the vote Steve Deace an Iowa conservative said that Trumps behaviour is both a good and a bad thing On the one hand it creates loyal supporters who love Trumps personality On the other hand it means he cannot change that personality Republican Frank Luntz believes Trump speaks for voters who for the rst time feel as if they have a mouthpiece and like the fact that they feel like they are heard He says Trump says what theyre thinking and the more outrageous he is the more they agree with him Hes saying what no politician would say and thats another reason they like him That is certainly the feeling among ordinary supporters who go to his very crowded campaign events I like the way he speaks says Sandra Murray of Dubuque Iowa This country is a big mess and he could be the man to help us Other supporters offer a simpler explanation Hes not afraid of anybody or anything Thats cool,Unless we win it doesnt mean a damn thing said billionaire Donald Trump the man who wants to be the Republican presidential nominee at a campaign rally in South Carolina He said this despite nishing his fourth month in a row at the top of the opinion polls I want to pick my date for the election I want it next Tuesday he con ded to the crowd of 11000 people He has a lot of grassroots support which he needs to continue until March 2016 for him to win the nomination to be the presidential candidate in Novembers general election Trump is not the only one beginning to think it possible that his surprising campaign can go the distance particularly because recent controversy only seems to have con rmed his lead over his rivals Usually any one of these outbursts would have destroyed a politician by now First he outraged prisoners of war by doubting the heroism of Vietnam veteran John McCain because he allowed himself to be captured Then there was the rst television debate where he insulted Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly because she asked him dif cult questions It seems that making prisoners of war Fox News and women angry was not enough Trump has also insulted Mexican immigrants to the US claimed that a Black Lives Matter protester who was violently thrown out of a rally deserved to be roughed up appeared to laugh at a New York Times journalist for his disability and falsely accused Muslim Americans of supporting the 911 attackers Trump has complained that many of these incidents were exaggerated by the political media 70 of whom he says are scum But he has refused to retract any of the comments Some rivals still hope that eventually even Trumps supporters will get tired of his attacks on minorities One poll shows his support among Republicans has reduced by 12 points although at 31 he is still in the lead He is an egomaniac hes a narcissist Hes not a conservative hes not a liberal he believes in himself former presidential rival Bobby Jindal told the Guardian before he left the race But there is more to Trump than attention grabbing outrage As he is happy to tell supporters the three things that he is most against immigration reform freetrade deals and Barack Obamas national security policy have become perhaps the most important issues of the election His policies for deporting every undocumented immigrant in the US and demanding that Mexico pays for a border wall A real wall A very tall wall taller than that ceiling might sound unrealistic but they have destroyed the campaign hopes of Jeb Bush who favours immigration reform So what can stop Trump One reason for hope among opponents is the strong evidence that polls this far away from election day can be incorrect simply because most people have not made up their minds how to vote yet Among Americans who say they are Republicans current polls suggest he has 2530 of the vote In the political battle for hearts and minds converting Trumps passionate supporters will be hard It is hard to imagine anyone being a better Trump than Trump This scenario can be best understood by looking at responses to the question Which candidates would you de nitely not support for the Republican nomination for president While 2030 of voters say they would support Trump another 2030 say they de nitely would not Steve Deace an Iowa conservative said that Trumps behaviour is both a good and a bad thing On the one hand it produces loyal fans that are attracted to his personality On the other hand it limits his ability to grow beyond that Top Republican pollster Frank Luntz believes Trump speaks for voters who for the rst time feel as if they have a mouthpiece and like the fact that they feel like they are heard He says Trump says what theyre thinking and the more outrageous he is the more they agree with him Hes saying what no politician would say and thats another reason they like him That is

the US The officials included the former Brazilian federation chief Ricardo Teixeira and his successor Marco Polo Del Nero They were among 16 individuals accused of fraud and other crimes by the US Department of Justice The US has now charged 27 defendants including former FIFA executives The level of corruption is completely unacceptable said the US Attorney General Loretta Lynch Swiss police arrested the president of the South American football confederation the Paraguayan Juan ngel Napout and Alfredo Hawit the head of the North and Central American and Caribbean governing body Hawit

reputation The Swiss Federal Office of Justice said of the latest arrests They are in custody before their extradition The US believes they accepted bribes of millions of dollars Webb and the Colombian former executive Luis Bedoya entered guilty pleas in the US Eleven current and former FIFA executives have now been charged in the investigation which alleges 200m in bribes mainly from TV and marketing contracts but also FIFAs development programmes The message from this announcement should be clear to everyone who hopes to escape our investigation you will not escape said Lynch Teixeira the former soninlaw of the FIFA expresident Joo Havelange was charged together with Del Nero and his predecessor Jos Maria Marin who was charged in May 2015 Fourteen men were charged in May 2015 Days later Blatter won a fifth term as president but then agreed to leave his job as the crisis grew He was then suspended together with the UEFA President Michel Platini because of an alleged 13m payment to the Frenchman Both men might get life bans when the FIFA ethics committee hears their case in December if they are found guilty Among those also charged on Thursday were Rafael Salguero a Guatemalan who left the executive committee in May the former South American confederation secretary general Eduardo Deluca former Peruvian football federation president Manuel Burga and Bolivias football president Carlos Chaves already jailed in his own country Lynch said The Department of Justice really wants to end the corruption in the leadership of international football not only because

But he said neither he nor the organization was corrupt Hayatou appeared for the first time before the media since he started the job in September when Blatter was suspended and said the current crisis was the fault of a few bad people FIFA is not corrupt We have some people that have shown negative behaviour But not everyone in FIFA is corrupt said Hayatou president of the Confederation of African Football for more than 25 years There are lots of people who have been in FIFA for more than 20 or 30 years that have not been accused of anything,The day began with more police dawn raids on the Baur Au Lac hotel in Zurich and ended with 16 football officials being charged with corruption in the US including five current or former members of FIFAs executive committee They included the former Brazilian federation chief Ricardo Teixeira and his successor Marco Polo Del Nero who recently stepped down from the FIFA executive committee They were among 16 individuals accused of fraud and other offences by the US Department of Justice as it gave details of a series of kickback schemes in a new 240page indictment Twentyseven defendants have now been charged by the US including former FIFA executive committee members The betrayal of trust here is outrageous the US Attorney General Loretta Lynch said The scale of corruption is completely unacceptable Swiss police arrested the president of the South American football confederation the Paraguayan Juan ngel Napout and Alfredo Hawit the head of the North and Central American and Caribbean governing body Hawit only succeeded Jeffrey Webb in May 2015 after Webb was arrested as part of the US operation that threw FIFA into crisis and led to the downfall of Sepp Blatter Webbs predecessor the controversial Jack Warner was also arrested in May The Swiss Federal Office of Justice said of the latest arrests They are in custody pending their extradition According to the US arrest requests they are suspected of accepting bribes of millions of dollars Webb and the Colombian former executive committee member Luis Bedoya were among those whose guilty pleas were entered in the US Eleven current and former members of FIFAs executive committee have now been charged in the investigation which alleges 200m in bribes mainly as kickbacks from TV and marketing contracts but also FIFAs development programmes The message from this announcement should be clear to every individual who remains in the shadows hoping to evade our investigation you will not escape our focus said Lynch Teixeira the former soninlaw of the FIFA expresident Joo Havelange was charged alongside Del Nero and his predecessor Jos Maria Marin who was charged in May Fourteen men had been charged in May 2015 Days later Blatter won a fifth term as

executive committee in May the former South American confederation Secretary General Eduardo Deluca the former Peruvian football federation president Manuel Burga and Bolivias football president Carlos Chaves already jailed in his own country Lynch said The Department of Justice is committed to ending the rampant corruption we have described in the leadership of international football not only because of the scale of the schemes alleged earlier and today or the breadth of the operation required to sustain such corruption but also because of the insult to international principles that this behaviour represents The acting FIFA President Issa Hayatou refused to comment on the detail of the latest arrests But he said neither he nor the organization was corrupt Appearing for the first

next summer More men have signed up than women 53 to 47 with comments such as I can finally be honest about what I want The site has come at the right time for the country of five million people Danes are not having enough children and the current rate of 17 children per family means that the population is falling The usual reasons are given women are leaving it too late and couples are living together without getting married and waiting to start families Now I hope men and women who want to start a family but havent met the right person yet will have another choice says Limal He says that this isnt just about making babies I want this to be about children and love My goal is to bring together people who really want a family and a partner and wholl stay together Im a romantic He is

we dont make them say how many children theyd like That would be a bit too much like grocery shopping online He has had a very positive response to the site We had 50 signups an hour when we started in June and we are already hearing from couples who have met through the site and are now together Im fully expecting the first Babyklarnu baby by next summer More men have signed up than women 53 to 47 with comments such as Its so lovely to be able to say this out loud and I finally dare to be honest about what I want The site has come at the right time for the country of five million people Danes are not having enough babies according to a report from the Copenhagen hospital Rigshospitalet and the current rate of 17 children per family is not enough to maintain Denmarks population The usual reasons are given women are leaving it too late and couples are living together without getting married and waiting to start families Now I hope men and women who want to start a family but havent met the right person yet will have another option says Limal He says that this isnt just about baby farming I want this to be about children and love My goal is to pair up people who really want a family and a partner and wholl stay together Im a romantic at heart There are plans to launch the site in France and the UK later in 2013 but for now it is the Danes who are benefitting from it Danes have no problem having children before marriage so things can move fast and because the countrys so small a Jutlander can date a Copenhagener without too much travel Limal said Whats more Limal has finally found love Ive met a nice woman and she wants a baby too so we shall see,train,ELE,INT
111,Tea baked beans on toast and fish and chips have always been popular in Britain But things are changing according to data published recently in the National Food Survey Everyone knows that the British love tea but they drink more than 50 less tea than in the 1970s 68g of tea per person per week compared to only 25g Britons are now drinking on average only eight cups of tea a week they drank 23 cups in 1974 Tea is still the most popular hot drink in the UK but people now spend more money on coffee The data comes from 150000 families who took part in the survey between 1974 and 2000 combined with information from 2000 to 2014 It shows a move towards healthier food in recent years people have changed to lowcalorie soft drinks from whole to skimmed milk and they eat more fresh fruit But the amount of chips pizza crisps and ready meals they eat each week has increased a lot There has also been an enormous change from white to brown bread The survey also shows the amount of bread people eat has fallen from 25 to 15 slices a week over the past forty years The amount of baked beans people eat has reduced by 20 But there has been an increase in other types of convenience food particularly Italian dishes Adults in the UK now eat an average of 75g of pizza every week compared with none in 1974 The amount of pasta they eat has almost tripled over the same period Fresh potatoes are also becoming less popular with a 67 decrease from 1974 when adults ate around 188g every day People eat more of other vegetables such as cucumbers courgettes aubergines and mushrooms The amount of takeaway food they eat has almost doubled since 1974 from 80g per person per week to 150g Around 33g of this amount is chips and 56g is meat with kebabs 10g chicken 7g burgers 5g and meatbased meals 32g particularly popular It seems that British people are now more careful about what they eat the amount of fruit has increased by 50 since 1974 In 2014 UK adults ate an average of 157g of fruit per day Bananas have been the most popular fruit in the UK since 1996 adults ate 221g per adult per week in 2014 much more than apples 131g and oranges 48g Half of all soft drinks British people drink are now lowcalorie soft drinks Britons also spend a smaller percentage of their salaries on food today 11 compared with 24 in 1974 The UK Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss said Food is the heart of our society This data shows what we were eating 40 years ago but also how a change in culture has led to a food revolution People care more about where their food comes from than before we can order quality food on the internet fashionable restaurants give us the latest trends and exciting global cuisines are now as common as fish and chips She added that this data can show us more than what where or how older generations ate It can also show us when our habits changed The National Food Survey can tell us a lot and help us to predict new food trends I look forward to seeing how we can use this data to learn more about our past and grow our worldleading food and farming industry in the future she said,Tea baked beans on toast and fish and chips have long been part of the British food tradition But there has been a change in tastes over the generations This has been clearly shown in data published recently in the National Food Survey which was set up in 1940 by the government because of concerns about health and access to food Everyone knows the British love tea but consumption has more than halved since the 1970s falling from 68g of tea per person per week to only 25g Britons are now drinking on average only eight cups of tea a week down from 23 cups in 1974 And while tea remains the most popular hot drink in the UK people now spend more money on coffee The data is from 150000 households who took part in the survey between 1974 and 2000 combined with information from 2000 to 2014 It shows a move towards healthier diets in recent decades with shifts to lowcalorie soft drinks from whole to skimmed milk and increasing consumption of fresh fruit But weekly consumption of chips pizza crisps and ready meals has soared There has also been a dramatic shift from white to brown bread but the figures suggest the amount of bread people are eating has fallen from 25 to 15 slices a week over the past four decades The consumption of baked beans has dropped by a fifth despite a rise in other types of convenience food particularly Italian dishes Adults in the UK now eat an average of 75g of pizza every week compared with none in 1974 while the consumption of pasta has almost tripled over the same period Fresh potatoes are also becoming less essential with a 67 decrease from 1974 when adults ate the equivalent of 188g every day Sales of other vegetables such as cucumbers courgettes aubergines and mushrooms have increased Consumption of takeaway food has almost doubled since 1974 from 80g per person per week to 150g Around 33g of this amount is chips and 56g is meat with kebabs 10g chicken 7g burgers 5g and meatbased meals 32g particularly popular Some trends suggest that British people are becoming more careful about what they put on their plates with the average consumption of fruit increasing by 50 since 1974 In 2014 UK adults ate an average of 157g of fruit per day Bananas have been the most popular fruit in the UK since 1996 reaching 221g per adult per week in 2014 well above apples 131g and oranges 48g Lowcalorie soft drinks represented half of all soft drinks consumed in 2014 for the first time Britons are also spending a smaller proportion of their salaries on food today 11 compared with 24 in 1974 The UK Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss said Food is the heart of our society and this data not only shows what we were eating 40 years ago but how a change in culture has led to a food revolution Shoppers care more about where their food comes from than ever before the internet has brought quality food to our doors at the click of a button fashionable restaurants are showcasing the latest trends and exciting global cuisines are now as common as fish and chips By studying this data we can look beyond what where or how previous generations were eating and pinpoint the moments that changed our habits forever Weve only scratched the surface of what the National Food Survey can tell us From local food maps and school projects to predicting new food trends I look forward to seeing how this data can be used to learn more about our past and grow our worldleading food and farming industry in

138,Our new international survey including 33 countries shows how wrong people around the world are about some important things British people think the richest 1 own 59 of their countrys wealth when they actually only own 23 Americans think that 33 of their population are immigrants but it is really only 14 Brazilians think the average age in their country is 56 when it is only 31 Russians think that 31 of their politicians are women when it is only 14 In Britain people think that 43 of young adults aged 2534 still live at home with their parents rather than the actual 14 In India people who did the online survey think 60 of the whole country also has internet access when really only 19 do So why do people across the world know so little about these things Some of us dont understand the questions For example most countries overestimate how many people are not religious in the 33 countries people thought 37 are not religious but the real number is actually just 18 This is because we are thinking of how many people practise their religion rather than how many people say they have a religion Rural areas are large so that is why people overestimate how many people live in the countryside We see things from our own perspective and nd it dif cult to imagine that there is a lot of variety in our countries For example the people from India who did the survey really overestimated their populations access to the internet Most people did the study online and in developing countries this means the people who did the survey were probably wealthy What we found from the survey is that people generalize from their own situations and forget that other peoples situations might be different In Britain this is probably the reason why people overestimated how much the richest people own how many young people are still living at home and what proportion of the population are immigrants the guess is 25 when it is really only 13 People are worried about these things and because of this they overestimate But the survey suggests there are also some problems that people are not very worried about but they should be more worried For example most countries really underestimate how much of their population is overweight The worst case is Saudi Arabia where people think only 28 are overweight when 71 are Britons think it is 44 when actually 62 are overweight In many ways it is the differences between countries that are the most interesting and important aspects of the study The top 1 in Russia own 70 of the nations wealth while the top 1 in New Zealand only own 18 Half of Italians aged 2534 still live with their parents but only 4 in Norway The average age in India is 27 it is 47 in Japan Only 10 of politicians are women in Brazil Hungary and Japan when 44 are in Sweden When the reality is so strange and varied it is not surprising that were often so wrong,Our new international survey across 33 countries shows how wrong people around the world are about key social realities British people think the top 1 wealthiest households own 59 of their countrys wealth when they actually only own 23 Americans think that 33 of their population are immigrants when in fact it is only 14 Brazilians think the average age in their country is 56 when it is only 31 Russians think that 31 of their politicians are women when it is only 14 In Britain people think that 43 of young adults aged 2534 still live at home with their parents rather than the actual 14 In India the online population think 60 of the whole country also has internet access when in fact only 19 do Why are people across the world so often clueless about these realities It is partly that we just struggle with basic maths and some of us clearly misunderstand the questions or interpret them differently For example most countries hugely overestimate how many people are not religious across the 33 countries respondents think that 37 are not religious but the average is actually just 18 This is because we are thinking of how many people practise their religion rather than how many people see themselves as having a religion People also take mental shortcuts where they take easily available information even if it doesnt quite t the question Our huge overestimates of the rural populations in most countries will be affected by how large rural areas are rather than a careful calculation of how many people live in them In Daniel Kahnemans terms answers to these sorts of questions are classic examples of fast thinking rather than slow We see things from our own perspective and struggle to imagine the variety in our countries This was highlighted by our Indian respondents who massively overestimated their populations access to the internet Our study was mostly carried out through an online survey and in developing countries this will be representative of a more wealthy connected group rather than the general population What we nd throughout the study is that people generalize from their own situations and forget how unrepresentative they are We suffer from what social psychologists call emotional innumeracy when we are estimating realities this means we are sending a message about what is worrying us as much as trying to get the right answers For Britain worries are part of the explanation for peoples huge overestimates of how much the wealthiest own how many young people are still living at home and what proportion of the population are immigrants the guess is 25 when it is really only 13 People are worried about these things and because of this they overestimate how big the problems are But the survey suggests there are also some issues where people are not as worried as they should be For example most countries hugely underestimate how much of their population is overweight or obese The worst case is Saudi Arabia where people think only 28 are when 71 are Britons think it is 44 when it is actually nearly half as much again 62 are either overweight or obese And in many ways it is not our misperceptions but these realities across different countries that are the most interesting and important aspects of the study The top 1 in Russia own 70 of the nations wealth while the top 1 in New Zealand only own 18 Half of Italians aged 2534 still live with their parents when it is only 4 in Norway The average age in India is 27 it is 47 in Japan Only 10 of politicians are women in Brazil Hungary and Japan when 44 are in Sweden When the reality is so strange and varied it is no wonder were so

141,BB King was most famous for blues music but he was always interested in other types of music and different cultures Perhaps it is too early to say he is the last of the bluesmen but it is hard to imagine that any future blues artist will have the in uence as BB King He in uenced thousands of musicians and millions of music fans in a career that lasted 65 years Riley B King was born in Mississippi the son of AfricanAmerican farm workers He learnt the guitar from a family friend and learnt to sing with a quartet of gospel singers In his early 20s he moved to Memphis He was soon playing regularly at a bar in West Memphis and he also became a disc jockey with a show on a local radio station He was known as The Beale Street Blues Boy but this was shortened to Blues Boy King and then to BB In 1950 King began recording for Modern Records He had his rst hit in 1952 with Three OClock Blues It was number one in the RB chart for 15 weeks it was the rst of many hits King developed a style that was new and different but had its roots in blues history He often praised the musicians who in uenced him and he usually mentioned TBone Walker rst He also mentioned the earlier blues guitarists Blind Lemon Jefferson and Lonnie Johnson and the jazz players Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt He once explained that his guitar technique was partly the result of his lack of skill I started to bend notes because I could never play in the bottleneck style I loved that sound but just couldnt do it During the 1950s King was the leading blues artist in many series of concerts In 1956 he played 342 concerts In 1962 he tried to change that working pattern by signing with a major label ABC But the rst records under that contract were not very successful with his fans or with the record company But his 1965 album Live at the Regal has become famous and in uenced many younger musicians He had more RB hits with blues songs and in 1969 he was near the top of the pop charts where no blues artist had been for many years with a song called The Thrill Is Gone It was a long time before he became known to a rock audience but musicians who admired him brought him to the attention of rock fans About a year and a half ago he said in 1969 kids suddenly started saying to me Youre the greatest blues guitarist in the world And Id say Who told you that And theyd say Mike Bloom eld or Eric Clapton These young musicians made me popular again From then on King was well known as a leading blues artist He went on international concert tours to Japan Australia China and Russia He also gave concerts to prisoners in Chicago and at San Quentin In 1990 doctors told King he had diabetes and he reduced his touring He now had to play sitting down but his singing and playing were almost as good as ever The celebrations for his 80th birthday in 2005 included an awardwinning album with Clapton Mark Knop er Roger Daltrey Gloria Estefan and others tributes from Bono Amadou Bagayoko and Elton John and a goodbye tour that was not a goodbye at all In 2009 King received a Grammy award for best traditional blues album for One Kind Favor In 2012 he performed at a concert at the White House where the US President Barack Obama joined him to sing Sweet Home Chicago King was twice married and twice divorced He is survived by 11 children by various partners four others died before him,Much of BB Kings best work was blues but he was always openminded about and interested in other kinds of music He bridged musical and cultural differences with warmth and skill Perhaps it is too early to speak of the last of the bluesmen but it is hard to imagine that any future blues artist will match King He in uenced thousands of musicians and millions of music fans in a career that lasted 65 years Riley B King the B did not seem to stand for a name was born in Mississippi the son of AfricanAmerican farm workers He learnt the basics of guitar from a family friend and perfected his singing with a quartet of gospel singers In his early 20s he moved to Memphis Within a couple of years he was playing regularly at a bar in West Memphis and he also became a disc jockey presenting a show on a Memphis radio station His billing The Beale Street Blues Boy was shortened to Blues Boy King and then to BB After a single session in 1949 for a Nashville label King began recording for the West Coastbased Modern Records in 1950 He had his rst hit in 1952 with Three OClock Blues which was number one in the RB chart for 15 weeks it was the rst of many hits On these and his dozens of other recordings most of them his own compositions King developed a style that was innovative but had its roots in blues history He was always ready to praise the musicians who had in uenced him he would usually mention TBone Walker rst He would also cite the earlier blues guitarists Blind Lemon Jefferson and Lonnie Johnson and the jazz players Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt He once explained that his guitar technique was partly based on his lack of skill I started to bend notes because I could never play in the bottleneck style I loved that sound but just couldnt do it He was modest about his singing too a mixture of the style of ballad singers such as Nat King Cole and blues shouters such as Joe Turner and Dr Clayton Probably his favourite composer and singer was Louis Jordan whose music he commemorated in the 1999 album Let the Good Times Roll Throughout the 1950s King was the leading blues artist on an endless series of onenighters In 1956 he played 342 gigs In 1962 he tried to change that working pattern by signing with a major label ABC but the rst records under that contract were rather unsuccessful both with his fans and with the record company The 1965 album Live at the Regal however has become iconic a turning point in the early listening of many younger musicians He had further RB hits with blues numbers including How Blue Can You Get and Paying the Cost to Be the Boss and in 1969 he got near the top of the pop charts where no blues artist had been for many years with The Thrill Is Gone It took him a while to establish himself with a rock audience but he was brought to their attention by musicians who admired him About a year and a half ago he said in 1969 all of a sudden kids started saying to me Youre the greatest blues guitarist in the world And Id say Who told you that And theyd say Mike Bloom eld or Eric Clapton I owe my new popularity to these youngsters From then on King was rmly established as a leading blues artist Guided by his manager Sidney Seidenberg he went on international concert tours that took him to Japan Australia China and Russia He also gave concerts to prisoners at the Cook County jail in Chicago and at San Quentin which led to his long involvement in rehabilitation programmes In 1990 King was diagnosed with diabetes and cut back his touring but his followers outside the US could still see him every year or two He would now deliver most of his act sitting down but the strength of his singing and the uency of his playing were almost as good as ever The celebrations for his 80th birthday in 2005 included an awardwinning album of collaborations with Clapton Mark Knop er Roger Daltrey Gloria Estefan and others tributes from musicians as diverse as Bono Amadou Bagayoko and Elton John and a goodbye tour that

183,In Iceland you can be called Aagot Arney or sfrur Baldey Bebba or Br Dgg Dimmbl Etna and Eybjrt are fine and so are Frigg Glds Hrn and Ingunn Jrlaug is OK and so are Obba Sigurflj rana and Vagna But if you are a girl in Iceland you cannot be called Harriet The situation is silly said Tristan Cardew a British cook who moved to Iceland in 2000 With his Icelandic wife Kristin Cardew is appealing against a decision by the National Registry in the capital Reykjavik the registry decided not to renew the Cardews tenyearold daughter Harriets passport because it does not recognize her first name The registry does not recognize the name of Harriets 12yearold brother Duncan either so until now the two children have travelled on passports with the names Stlka and Drengur Cardew which mean Girl and Boy Cardew But this time the registry has decided to apply the law And the law says no official document will be given to people who do not have an approved Icelandic name The situation meant the family were going to miss their holiday in France but they have applied to the British embassy for an emergency UK passport which should now allow them to leave Names are important in Iceland a country of only 320000 people The law says that unless both parents are foreign the names of children born in Iceland must be submitted to the National Registry within six months of birth If a name is not on a recognized list of 1853 female and 1712 male names the parents must get approval from the Icelandic Naming Committee About 5000 children are born in Iceland each year and the committee receives about 100 applications It rejects about half of these names because it wants to preserve the Icelandic language There is a law that says names must be able to have Icelandic grammatical endings and should be written using the ordinary rules of Icelandic spelling What this means is that names with letters that do not officially exist in Icelands 32letter alphabet such as c are not permitted Also names that cannot be used with the case endings used in Icelandic are also rejected That was the problem with Harriet said Cardew The countrys naming laws have been criticized in recent years in 2013 Blr Light Breeze Bjarkardttir Rnarsdottir won the right to be officially called her name not Girl The former mayor of Reykjavik Jn Gnarr has also called Icelands naming law unfair stupid and against creativity The Cardews could solve Harriets problem by giving her an Icelandic middle name But its a bit late for that and much too silly said Cardew Are they saying they dont want us

apply the letter of the law Cardew a Britishborn cook who moved to Iceland in 2000 said And that says no official document will be issued to people who do not bear an approved Icelandic name The situation meant the family from Kpavogur risked missing their holiday in France until they applied to the British embassy for an emergency UK passport which should now allow them to leave Names are important in Iceland a country of only 320000 people whose phone book lists subscribers by their first name for the very sensible reason that most Icelandic surnames simply record the fact that you are your fathers or mothers son or daughter Jn Einarssons children for example might be lafur Jnsson and Sigrur Jnsdttir The law says that the names of children born in Iceland must unless both parents are foreign be submitted to the National Registry within six months of birth If they are not on a recognized list of 1853 female and 1712 male names the parents must seek the approval of a body called the Icelandic Naming Committee For the 5000 or so children born in Iceland each year the committee reportedly receives about 100 applications and rejects about half under a 1996 law aimed mainly at preserving the Icelandic language Among its requirements are that given names must be capable of having Icelandic grammatical endings may not conflict with the linguistic structure of Iceland and should be written in accordance with the ordinary rules of Icelandic spelling What this means in practice is that names containing letters that do not officially exist in Icelands 32letter alphabet such as c are out Similarly names unable to accommodate the endings required by the different cases used in Icelandic are also routinely turned down That was the problem with Harriet said Cardew The countrys naming laws have been criticized in recent years in 2013 Blr Light Breeze Bjarkardttir Rnarsdottir won the right to be officially known by her given name as opposed to Girl when a court ruled that denying her was a violation of the Icelandic constitution The former mayor of Reykjavik Jn Gnarr has also called Icelands naming law unfair stupid and against creativity The Cardews could get round Harriets problem by giving her an Icelandic middle name But its a bit late for that and way too silly said Cardew Are they saying they dont want us here,train,ELE,INT
13,American researchers say that a nasal spray containing the Love hormone oxytocin could help children with autism behave more normally in social situations Scans of autistic children showed that the chemical made the brain respond better to faces This could make social interactions easier for them The researchers said oxytocin might help other treatments that are used to help people with autism in social situations Over time there would be more normal social responding Autistic people would be more interested in interacting with other people there would be more eye contact and more conversation said Kevin Pelphrey of Yale University Autism is a disorder that one in 100 people have It affects people in different ways but causes difficulties in social interaction and communication So far there is no effective treatment for the social problems that autism causes Researchers at Yale have studied the brain chemical oxytocin They say it is a possible treatment for the social problems caused by autism because it plays an important role in bonding and trust But not all results are positive one recent study found no significant benefit for young people who took the chemical for several days But Pelphrey said oxytocin might help the brain learn from social interactions it would work best when used together with therapies that encourage people with autism to interact more socially he said Scientists tested 17 young people aged eight to 16 with autism They gave them either oxytocin or a placebo through a nose spray Then the scientists scanned their brains while they looked at images of cars or the eyes of people expressing different emotions The scans showed that some parts of the childrens brains behaved more normally after oxytocin they were more active when the person was looking at faces and less active when the person was looking at the cars The study suggests that oxytocin might treat basic social motivation This is something for which we dont have a treatment in autism said Pelphrey He said that it was too early to use oxytocin as a treatment for the social difficulties caused by autism and said people should not buy oxytocin online We dont want them to try oxytocin at home It is impossible to say what they are buying This is not a treatment yet It needs more research he said But the scientists were surprised to find that oxytocin did not help the children in social recognition tasks It is also not known yet if oxytocin only has benefits for people with autism or has any bad side effects Finally oxytocin effects only last about 45 minutes so it might be difficult to use it as a treatment This study has a lot of evidence from animal and human work to show that oxytocin helps but we need more research Said Simon BaronCohen Uta Frith who studies autism at University College London said According to this study oxytocin may make faces more interesting Disappointingly this effect is seen only in brain activity and not in behaviour She said that if we want oxytocin to become an important treatment for autism we need to show that is has an effect on behaviour,According to American researchers a nasal spray containing the Love hormone oxytocin could help children with autism behave more normally in social situations Scans of autistic children showed that a single dose of the chemical improved brain responses to facial expressions This is something that could make social interactions feel more natural and rewarding for them The researchers said oxytocin might increase the success of behavioural therapies that are already used to help people with autism learn to cope with social situations Over time what you would expect to see is more normal social responding being more interested in interacting with other people more eye contact and more conversation said Kevin Pelphrey of Yale University Autism is a developmental disorder that more than one in 100 people have The condition affects people in different ways but leads to difficulties in social interaction and communication So far there is no established treatment for the social problems caused by autism Researchers at Yale have studied the brain chemical oxytocin as a possible treatment for the social problems caused by autism because it plays an important role in bonding and trust Results have been mixed though one recent study found no significant benefit for young people given the chemical over several days But Pelphrey said oxytocin might help the brain learn from social interactions it would work best when used with therapies that encourage people with autism to interact more socially he said The scientists scanned the brains of 17 young people aged eight to 16 with autism while they looked at images of cars or the eyes of people expressing different emotions The scans were given 45 minutes after the young people inhaled a placebo or oxytocin through a nasal spray The scans showed that the reward circuits in the childrens brains behaved more normally after a dose of oxytocin that is they were more active when the person was looking at faces and less active when looking at the inanimate cars The study appears in the latest issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in the United States The study suggests that oxytocin might treat something for which we dont have a treatment in autism and thats the core social motivation said Pelphrey He warned that it was too early to use oxytocin as a treatment for the social difficulties caused by autism and said people should not buy oxytocin online We dont want them trying oxytocin at home Its impossible to say what they are buying We are nowhere near thinking this is a ready treatment It needs more followup he said This is an important new study in identifying changes in brain activity in key areas of the brain said Simon BaronCohen director of the Autism Research Centre at Cambridge University A surprising finding however is that oxytocin nasal spray did not change performance in social recognition tasks And it is also not yet clear if oxytocin only has benefits for people with autism or has any unwanted side effects Finally oxytocin effects only last about 45 minutes so there may be practical considerations as to whether this could be used as a treatment From a scientific perspective this study has a lot of evidence from animal and human work to justify serious attention but more research is needed Doctors should be cautious about the potential of this hormone until we know much more about its benefits and risks in much larger studies Said Simon BaronCohen Uta Frith who studies autism at University College London said According to this study oxytocin may have the effect of making faces more

58,In 2010 it was too dangerous for the police to enter the old part of the city of Srinagar in India Violent separatists were fighting for an independent Kashmir and they had killed more than 100 people there But things change very quickly The same streets are now full of tourists The mosque where young people threw stones at the security forces will soon be part of an official walking tour Visitors can take photos in the beautiful gardens by the lake During the winter the nearby ski resorts were full of rich Russians In 2002 only 27000 tourists came to visit the Kashmir Valley Others were scared because of the antiIndian fighting almost 70000 people have died during the fighting So far in 2012 almost one million people have visited the area this includes more than 23000 from outside India But fewer than 150 Britons visited mainly because the UK governments advice is that the area is too dangerous to visit Omar Abdullah the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir has asked the British government to change its advice but they havent changed it Its frustrating says Abdullah Today because of that travel advice peoples insurance isnt valid when they visit here 1995 was the last time foreign tourists were murdered in Kashmir when an Islamist group kidnapped six westerners and killed five of them British citizens have been killed more recently in other countries I mean how many British citizens were killed on 911 Did you stop people from visiting New York Youve lost them in Spain in Bali said Abdullah Weve lost Indians in London There is still a possibility that alQaida could do something stupid but we havent stopped Indians from travelling to London There is no reason to say Kashmir or even Srinagar is a dangerous destination Germany changed its guidelines for travellers to the region in 2011 Foreigners are usually not direct targets the new guidelines said less than a year after the fighting in 2010 A national holiday on 15 August celebrated 65 years of Indian independence in the past this was a dangerous day because many people in the state do not feel part of India But there was no trouble at the independence celebrations on Wednesday Abdullah says tourists are safe in Kashmir if they are careful In other words do not go trekking near the border that separates the Indian and Pakistani parts of Kashmir Some visitors may feel it is not right to have fun in a place where local people have very high levels of anxiety and lots of mental health problems But the local people in Srinagar like tourism Amjid Gulzar 26 said Abdullah should encourage foreign visitors Without tourism our economy will be in chaos he said We need better roads reliable electricity We need more things for tourists to do in the evening we dont even have one cinema in this city he said But will tourists feel welcome In June a local Islamic group wrote a dress code for foreign tourists Abdullah says Nobody wants tourists to come here and cover their faces But they should be sensitive to our cultural identity and dress appropriately I think thats common sense Abdullah said tourism would help the economy Kashmirs economy is weak after more than twenty years of fighting The state receives just 72 million each year in taxes but it pays 155 million in salaries to 500000 public employees It is clear why he needs to find more money He is pleased to see tourists back Im not saying that one million tourists here shows that everything is normal again he said But it gives me some satisfaction that people can come have a nice time and go back,In 2010 the police would only enter the old city in Srinagar wearing body armour It was at the centre of uprisings by violent separatists who were fighting for an independent Kashmir More than 100 people died How quickly things change The same streets are now full of tourists The Nowhatta mosque is where young people would meet to throw stones at the security forces Now the mosque will be part of an official walking tour focused on heritage crafts and markets Visitors can have their picture taken in the beautiful gardens by the lake Until the snow melted the ski resorts nearby were packed with rich Russians too In 2002 only just over 27000 tourists dared to visit the Kashmir Valley People were frightened by the antiIndian insurgency in which almost 70000 people have died So far in 2012 the area has received almost one million tourists more than 23000 of them from outside India But there were fewer than 150 Britons mainly because the UKs Foreign Office advice deters most travellers by giving a list of recent security problems in the region Omar Abdullah the UKborn Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir has asked the British High Commission in Delhi to change its guidelines but without success Its frustrating admitted Abdullah who has been in charge of Indias most sensitive state since early 2009 Today unfortunately as a result of that travel advice peoples insurance isnt valid when they visit here 1995 was the last time foreign tourists were murdered in JK Six westerners including two Britons were kidnapped by AlFaran a Kashmiri militant Islamist group Only one survived British citizens have been killed more recently in countries that you still havent stopped people from visiting I mean how many British citizens did you lose in 911 Did you stop people from visiting New York Youve lost them in Spain in Bali said Abdullah Weve lost Indians in London There is still a possibility that alQaida could do something stupid but we havent stopped Indians from travelling to London There is no reason to say Jammu and Kashmir or even Srinagar is an unsafe destination Germany relaxed its guidelines for travellers to the region in 2011 Foreigners are usually not direct targets said Germanys amended advice At the time many thought it was a bold thing to say less than a year after the 2010 disturbances finally calmed down There was a national holiday on 15 August to celebrate 65 years of Indian independence in the past a day fraught with danger in a state where many do not feel part of India But there was no trouble at the independence celebrations Abdullah is confident that tourists are safe in the state if you take the normal sort of precautions In other words do not go trekking near the border that separates the Indian and Pakistani controlled parts of Kasmir Syed Ali Shah Geelani leader of the proKashmiri independence party disagrees with Abdullahs politics But the two men agree about tourism At the start of the summer season Geelani wrote an open letter to tourists that said Whatever your faith whatever language you speak and to whatever region you belong you are our honoured guest and respecting and protecting guests is not only our moral obligation but an article of faith Some visitors may worry about the ethics of having fun in a place where the local people are suffering from record levels of anxiety and mental health problems But the locals in Srinagar seem to be in favour of tourism Amjid Gulzar 26 said Abdullah could search for truth and reconciliation as well as encouraging foreign visitors He must do both but without tourism our economy will be in chaos he said We need better infrastructure better roads reliable electricity We need more for tourists to do in the evening we dont even have one cinema in this city he said But will tourists feel welcome In June a local Islamic group created a dress code for foreign tourists Abdullah sighs when I mention this Nobody wants tourists to come here and cover their faces I think

102,A group of experts say that thousands of people are taking unnecessary medicines and have bad diets because of bogus allergy tests Allergies and food intolerances are increasing very quickly but people do not understand the difference between an allergy and a food intolerance this is causing problems says the charity Sense About Science who have written a guide to allergies Its a big mess said Tracey Brown director of Sense About Science There is unnecessary action for people who dont really have allergies and not enough action for people who have allergies Lots of people tell the waiter or waitress in a restaurant that they have an allergy But some of these people dont have an allergy that have a food intolerance which is not dangerous Experts fear that restaurants hear so many people say that they have allergies when maybe that is not true that they may not be careful enough when they give food to a person who has a real allergy It matters very much said Moira Austin of an allergy charity If a restaurant thinks somebody just doesnt want to eat a food because it makes them feel uncomfortable the restaurant may be less careful There have been deaths where people have gone to a restaurant told the waiter or waitress that they have an allergy to a food and the meal has been given to them containing that food The guide says most allergy tests bought on the internet or in shops do not work They include a test people can use at home which looks for specific antibodies against different foods in the blood These antibodies are part of the bodys response to infections but the best medical evidence has shown high antibody levels do not suggest an allergy the guide says The test often shows people have an allergy or a food intolerance when this is not true Another test also does not work It uses a mixture of acupuncture and homeopathy Testing hair is also pointless the guide says Hair cannot show if you are allergic or not so testing hair cannot give any useful information on allergies I often see children who are on very limited diets their parents believe that they have allergies because they have taken allergy tests that do not work said Paul Seddon an allergy doctor for children This needs to stop which can only happen if we prove these tests do not work Allergies can cause tiredness headaches and eczema in children But you need to check if they have an allergy and this takes a long time and many tests It may seem like a good idea to do just one test and get a quick answer But it will be a wrong answer Allergies are increasing in developed countries There are three times more children with certain allergies now compared to 30 years ago The Sense About Science guide lists a number of myths about the sources of allergies for example the myths that fast food or E numbers in food colourings cause allergies,According to a group of experts bogus allergy tests are convincing thousands of people to take unnecessary treatments and put themselves or their children on inadequate diets This can result in malnutrition Allergies and food intolerances are increasing rapidly but confusion between the two as well as misdiagnosis are causing real harm said the charity Sense About Science which has produced a guide with the help of allergy specialists Its probably the biggest mess for science communication there are myths misinterpreted studies and bad medical practice All this results in under and overdiagnosis said Tracey Brown director of Sense About Science The costs are huge unnecessary actions for some and not enough action for those whose lives depend on it Experts fear that restaurants and caterers hear so many people say that they have allergies which can be dangerous for the individual when in fact they have a food intolerance which is not dangerous that they may not take all the precautions they should take when serving a person who has a genuine allergy It matters very much said Moira Austin of a charity that supports people suffering from anaphylaxis If a caterer thinks somebody is just avoiding a food because they dont want to get bloated they may be less careful There have been a number of fatalities where people have gone to a restaurant told staff that they have an allergy to a particular food and the meal has been served up containing that allergen The guide says most internet and shopbought allergy tests have no scientific basis They include a hometesting kit that looks for specific immunoglobulin G IgG antibodies against foods in the blood These antibodies are part of the immune systems response to infections but the best medical evidence has shown that high IgG levels do not suggest an allergy the guide says Results are often positive in people who do not have an allergy or a food intolerance Also unscientific is another test a mixture of acupuncture and homeopathy It attempts to measure electronic resistance across the skin while the child or adult holds the suspect food in their hand Hair sample testing is also pointless the guide says Hair is not involved in allergic reactions so testing hair samples cannot provide any useful information on allergies I commonly see children who have been put on to unnecessarily restricted diets Their parents assume in good faith that they have allergies to multiple foods because of allergy tests that have no scientific basis said Paul Seddon a paediatric allergist This needs to stop which can only happen if we prove these tests are unscientific Another paediatric allergist Adam Fox said I get a number of patients who come in after sending their hair off for analysis or after excluding a whole range of foods for their children It is very difficult to deal with that There are two challenges Children need to be given proper diets but it is the unnecessary avoidance of things that arent harmful that has a huge impact on the quality of life A child who cant eat wheat or drink milk cant go to parties The belief that a childs chronic lack of energy or headaches or eczema are caused by an allergy takes a long time and many tests to prove or disprove It is tempting to go to an alternative therapist who will do one test and provide a quick but wrong answer Allergies are increasing in developed countries The percentages of children diagnosed with allergic rhinitis and eczema have both trebled in the last 30 years This is leading many more people to suspect allergies are the reason for their own or their childrens health problems The guide lists a number of myths about the sources of allergies from the suggestion that they are caused by E numbers in food colourings to toxic overload and fast food,train,ELE,INT

and poor but it was negative about the 1 said Jamie TraegerMuney a wealth psychologist The media she said makes the rich feel like they need to hide or feel ashamed Sometimes I am shocked by things that people say You would never talk about another group of people in the way that it seems perfectly normal to talk about wealthy people Its really isolating to have a lot of money Peoples reaction to you can be scary said Barbara Nusbaum an expert in money psychology We are all taught not to talk about money Its not polite to talk about money But its harder to talk about being rich than it is to talk about being poor People dont mind if you say I am broke Things are hard You cant say I have a ton of money You have to keep a lot of your life private As a result Cockrell says the rich hang out with other rich Americans who understand them and their problems In the US over the last 30 years the number of very wealthy people has grown In 2014 the number of US households with 1m or more excluding the value of their main home was 101 million There were 13 million households worth 5 million and 142000 worth 25 million or more Since the 2008 nancial crisis the gap between the rich and the poor has grown and the situation has gotten worse for the wealthy Cockrell said The main reason Not knowing if your friends are friends with you or with your money Someone else who is also a billionaire they dont want anything from you Never being able to trust your friendships with other people I think that is dif cult said Cockrell Wealth can stop you from connecting with other people

in the 1 can be lonely Counsellors argue that things have become worse since the nancial crisis and the discussion about income inequality brought on by movements like Occupy Wall Street The Occupy Wall Street movement was a good one and had some important things to say about income inequality but it singled out the 1 as something negative said Jamie TraegerMuney a wealth psychologist and founder of the Wealth Legacy Group The media she said is partly to blame for making the rich feel like they need to hide or feel ashamed TraegerMuney runs a global business and specializes in working with inheritors who often get a bad reputation in the press Sometimes I am shocked by things that people say You would never refer to another group of people in the way that it seems perfectly normal

cant say I have a ton of money You have to keep a lot of your life private As a result Cockrell says the rich usually hang out with other rich Americans who understand them and their problems In the US over the last three decades the number of extremely wealthy people has been increasing According to research from Spectrem Group in 2014 the number of US households with 1m or more excluding the value of their main home increased by 500000 to 101m Households worth 5m or more reached 13m and 142000 households are now worth 25m or more Since the 2008 nancial crisis the income gap has grown and

questions in a debate about the internet Brazil and Peru have made objections to a bid made by the US online shop for the domain name amazon Amazon has asked for its company name to be a toplevel domain name currently com but the South American governments say this would stop the use of this internet address for environmental protection indigenous rights and other public interest uses There are many other disputed claims to names including patagonia Until now the differences between commercial governmental and other types of identity were easy to see in every internet address by the use of com gov and 20 other categories But soon there are going to be more of these categories or generic toplevel domains gTLDs as they are technically known The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN has had bids each worth almost 200000 for hundreds of new gTLDs to add to the 22 that we use already Amazon has applied for many new domains including shop song book and kindle But the one that has caused most discussion is its application for amazon Brazil and Peru want the amazon application to be stopped They say that a private company should not have a name that is also the name of an important geographical area Allowing private companies to register geographical names as gTLDs to profit from the meaning of these names is not in our view in the public interest the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology said Brazil said other members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty support its views Bolivia Colombia Ecuador Guyana Suriname and Venezuela There have also been other objections over new toplevel domains that use geographical or cultural names Argentina is unhappy that the US outdoor clothing retailer Patagonia wants a domain name that has been known far longer as a region of spectacular beauty Argentina rejects the patagonia request for a new generic toplevel domain Patagonia is an important region for the countrys economy because it has oil fishing mining and agriculture resources It is also a major tourist destination They will discuss the disputed bids again at a meeting of ICANNs Governmental Advisory Committee in Durban in July The first new domain names will probably be in use before the end of 2013,When you see the word Amazon whats the first thing you think of the worlds biggest forest the longest river or the largest internet shop and which do you think is most important These are questions in a debate about how to redraw the boundaries of the internet Brazil and Peru have made objections to a bid made by the huge US ecommerce company for a prime new piece of cyberspace amazon The Seattlebased company has applied for its brand to be a toplevel domain name currently com but the South American governments argue this would prevent the use of this internet address for environmental protection the promotion of indigenous rights and other public interest uses Together with many other disputed claims to names including patagonia the issue goes directly to the heart of debates about the purpose and governance of the internet Until now the differences between commercial governmental and other types of identity were easy to see in every internet address by the use of com gov and 20 other categories But these categories or generic toplevel domains gTLDs as they are technically known are about to see the biggest expansion since the start of the worldwide web The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN a USbased nonprofit organization that plays a key role in cyberspace governance has received bids each worth almost 200000 for hundreds of new gTLDs to add to the existing 22 Amazon has applied for many new domains including shop song book and kindle But the one that has caused most discussion is its application is for its own brand Brazil and Peru have asked for the amazon application to be withdrawn They say a private company should not be given a name that is also the name of an important geographical area an area that runs through and across their territories and is also used for certain regions and crossborder organizations Allowing private companies to register geographical names as gTLDs to strengthen their brand or to profit from the meaning of these names is not in our view in the public interest the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology said Brazil said its views were supported by other members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Bolivia Colombia Ecuador Guyana Suriname and Venezuela There have been other objections over proposed toplevel domains that take geographical cultural or contested brand names Argentina is unhappy that the US outdoor clothing retailer Patagonia is claiming a domain name that has been known far longer as a region of spectacular beauty that also has its own parliament Argentina rejects the patagonia request for a new generic toplevel domain Patagonia is an important region for the countrys economy because it has oil fishing mining and agriculture resources It is also a region with a vibrant local community and it is a major tourist destination The contested proposals are expected to be discussed again at a meeting of ICANNs Governmental Advisory Committee in Durban in July The first approved domain names will probably be in use before the end of 2013,train,ELE,INT
87,A long time ago cinema audiences were taken to a galaxy far far away That was 1977 but in 2015 just before its seventh lm interest in Star Wars is not slowing down Now there is news of a new lm about Han Solo and of a reappearance for Darth Vader Fans around the world are always waiting for new poster art new trailers and other information said Paul Dergarabedian senior media analyst I dont think any other movie franchise could cause this much excitement The latest Star Wars mania started after Disney bought Lucas lm from Star Wars creator George Lucas in 2012 After Disney paid 4 billion for Lucas lm it announced that there would be three more Star Wars lms VII VIII and IX plus plans for spinoff movies They have now announced details of the second spinoff It is a story about Han Solo the character played by Harrison Ford in the rst three lms This second new lm will be released in May 2018 Before that they will release Episode VII in December 2015 directed by JJ Abrams and called Star Wars The Force Awakens Episode VIII will come out in 2017 and a spinoff called Rogue One will arrive in cinemas in 2016 Lots of people are very interested in the rumour that Darth Vader the villain from the original lms will reappear in Rogue One This interest shows the power of Star Wars Lucas lmDisney are creating a cinema universe around Star Wars with many different characters and stories They are doing the same thing as the very successful lms produced by Marvel Studios Disney also bought them in 2009 Disney knows a lot about marketing Dergarabedian says the decision to make all six existing Star Wars lms available on streaming services is a brilliant way to make people excited about the new lm There has been much enthusiasm for Star Wars for at least twenty years This is shown by the huge number of novels comic books video games and merchandising that Lucas lm has created Michael Rosser news editor for the magazine Screen International says this is what makes Star Wars the top lm franchise The great thing about the rst Star Wars lms was that they created a huge universe of characters and stories he said For years people have wondered how the different parts of the story t together This new lm goes back to Han Solo and Luke Skywalker so it will reconnect with the rst Star Wars lm The prequels did not do that Rosser is talking about the three lms Lucas directed between 1999 and 2005 The Phantom Menace Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith They were about the life of Luke Skywalkers father Anakin who becomes Darth Vader They got quite bad reviews but they made 25 billion It shows the power of Star Wars the prequels were disappointing but they still made a lot of money said Rosser The movie studio wants to continue the franchise and make sure new lms are of good quality They also want people to go to the cinema at a time when lots of people are watching lms at home But you dont want to watch Star Wars on your iPhone Dergarabedian expects big business when The Force Awakens opens at cinemas in December 2015 It should make at least a billion dollars Star Wars is the ultimate movie franchise,A long time ago cinema audiences were transported to a galaxy far far away That was 1977 but in 2015 as the franchise plans to release its seventh lm interest in Star Wars shows no sign of slowing down Now there is news of a new lm about Han Solo and of a reappearance for Darth Vader Many fans around the world are constantly waiting for the release of new poster art new trailers and other information said Paul Dergarabedian a senior media analyst Its hard to imagine any other movie franchise that could cause this much enthusiasm and excitement The latest Star Wars mania started after Disneys purchase of Lucas lm from the lms creator George Lucas in 2012 Disney paid 4bn for Lucas lm and very soon announced that there would be three more Star Wars episodes VII VIII and IX plus plans for spinoff movies and standalones Details of the second spinoff have now been made public It is a story about Han Solo the intergalactic smuggler played by Harrison Ford in the rst three lms This second new lm will be released in May 2018 It will follow the release in December 2015 of Episode VII directed by JJ Abrams and titled Star Wars The Force Awakens The unnamed Episode VIII is due out in 2017 and a spinoff Rogue One will arrive in cinemas in 2016 That movie will outline a rebel mission to steal the plans of the Death Star a key part of the story in the rst lm in 1977 There was lots of interest in the rumour that Darth Vader the blackclad villain of the original series will reappear in Rogue One The interest con rms the power of Star Wars nostalgia In creating a multistoryline multicharacter cinema universe around Star Wars Lucas lmDisney are copying the phenomenally successful series of lms produced by Marvel Studios which Disney also bought in 2009 Disney has increased the level of marketing savvy to a product that was already popular Dergarabedian says the decision to make all six existing Star Wars lms available on streaming services is a brilliant way to build the excitement for the new lm and reinvigorate the idea of Star Wars in the minds of the fans But it is not certain that it needs reinvigorating The level of enthusiasm that has surrounded Star Wars for at least the last twenty years is shown by the huge number of novels comic books video games and merchandising that Lucas lm has created over the years Michael Rosser news editor for Screen International suggests that it is this shared universe of nostalgia that makes Star Wars the top lm franchise The great thing about the original lms was that they created a huge universe of characters and possibility that sparked the imagination of viewers he said For years people have been wondering how the different parts of the story t together This new lm goes back to Han Solo and Luke Skywalker so we hope it will reconnect with the original Star Wars lms The prequels failed to do that Rosser is referring to the three lms Lucas directed between 1999 and 2005 The Phantom Menace Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith which were about the life of Luke Skywalkers father Anakin who becomes Darth Vader Despite quite bad reviews the prequels took 25bn at the worldwide box of ce It shows the power of Star Wars that although they were disappointing the prequels still made a lot of money said Rosser In the world of lm branding and a successful franchise are very important Is there a risk that movie studios will simply become branding machines and lose their interest in cinema Rosser thinks not They are desperate to keep the franchise going and make sure new lms are of good quality They also want people to go to the cinema at a time when lots are staying home for entertainment But you dont want to watch Star Wars on your iPhone Meanwhile Dergarabedian expects massive business when The Force Awakens reaches cinemas in December 2015 We certainly expect a record opening for December and the lm should make at least a billion dollars worldwide Truly Star Wars is the ultimate movie brand,train,ELE,INT
95,The Greek island of Agios Efstratios is very remote It has been forgotten by the banks the government and most of the modern world It doesnt have a single ATM or creditcard machine Before the economic crisis in Greece the people of this peaceful island in the northern Aegean lived quite well The few rooms to rent were fully booked every summer with people enjoying its empty beaches clear seas and fresh seafood But the island still uses only cash so the closure of the Greek banks has had a serious effect Local people have to make ninehour round trips to the nearest big island to get cash Greek visitors say they dont have enough cash to come Tourist numbers have reduced by 80 this year said Mayor Maria Kakali in an of ce in the village where she grew up The village has about 200 people Even people born here and living in Athens who have their own places on the island arent coming Kakali has asked the government and a major Greek bank to install an ATM and this should arrive soon But tourism is the main business on the island and she feels the ATM may come too late for this season We have almost no reservations in August when usually we are full But there is an even bigger crisis ahead the government has said it will end a tax break for islands The tax break was created to help people on islands survive when lots of people were emigrating Islands that are popular with tourists such as Mykonos fear that losing the tax break will make things very hard for them But for Agios Efstratios it is a much bigger problem If we have to pay a tax of 23 we will all die on the island says Kakali Food and fuel are already more expensive than on mainland Greece Even in summer the island has only three shops two restaurants and not one of cial hotel This is an expensive island Everything even milk or bread takes a long time to reach us and so is very expensive said Provatas Costas a 58yearold sherman Things are also dif cult for the island of Lemnos the closest large neighbour of Agios Efstratios People saw the islands as remote for years partly because the only way to get there was by slow and unreliable ferries In 2015 they nally had new ef cient ferries and this brought many new visitors to explore these islands But then the bank controls began It started as the best season in 30 years and in one week it became the worst said Atzamis Konstantinos a travel agent in Lemnos Lemnos has wild beaches where you can swim and sunbathe almost alone a small nightlife scene and many cultural sites It is the eighth largest island in Greece so it will have to pay the tax increases in autumn 2015 But Lemnos is far less wealthy than many smaller islands It has just over 3000 beds for visitors Rhodes for example has tens of thousands of beds We have been suffering economically in recent years and now we will suffer more said Lemnos Mayor Dimitris Marinakis If taxes go up more young people will leave warns Mayor Kakali Because it is one of the smallest islands Agios Efstratios will not have to pay the tax increase until 2017 And Kakali hopes the situation in Greece will change before then But if not she plans to travel to Athens to remind the distant government what the tax rise would cost The government doesnt pay much attention to the islands of the north Aegean she said so I would take all the kids from our school to the gates of parliament to tell them There is still life in these islands,The Greek island of Agios Efstratios is so remote so forgotten by the banks the government and most of the modern world that there isnt a single ATM or creditcard machine on the island Before the economic crisis in Greece residents of this tranquil island in the northern Aegean managed quite well They did their banking at the post of ce and the few dozen rooms to rent were fully booked every summer with people who had heard by word of mouth of its spectacular empty beaches clear seas and fresh seafood But because the island still uses only cash the closure of the Greek banks has been devastating Residents have to make ninehour round trips to the nearest big island to get cash and Greek visitors say they cant get hold of enough money to come Tourist numbers have reduced by 80 this year said Mayor Maria Kakali in an of ce in the village where she grew up with a population of around 200 people Even people born here and living in Athens who have their own places on the island arent coming Kakali has badgered the government and a major Greek bank into promising an ATM within weeks but she still feels it may be too late for this season on an island where tourism is the main source of income We have almost no reservations in August when usually we have people calling us up asking to nd a room and we cant help them A hard winter ahead may be slightly improved because 50 workers will live and work in the village to expand the harbour But there is an even bigger crisis ahead because the government has said it will end a tax break for islands The tax break was created to help island communities survive the problem of mass emigration The lower sales tax reduced the costs of living on the islands where everything had to be imported and it made tourism more affordable Tourist favourites such as Mykonos fear that losing the tax breaks will make it hard for them to compete with Turkey But for Agios Efstratios it is a far greater problem If we have to pay a tax of 23 Im sorry to say it but we will all die on the island says Kakali Food and fuel are already more expensive than on the mainland Even in summer the island has only three shops two restaurants and not a single of cial hotel This is an expensive island Everything even milk or bread has been bought and sold three or four times before it gets to us and everyone has to take a pro t said Provatas Costas a 58yearold sherman For Agios Efstratios and its closest large neighbour Lemnos the timing of the crisis is particularly cruel They were seen as remote for years partly because you could only reach the islands by slow and unreliable ferries In 2015 the government had nally given the contract to a new ef cient company and this has brought many new visitors to explore the islands charms But then the bank controls hit It started as the best season in 30 years and in one week it became the worst said Atzamis Konstantinos a travel agent in Lemnos Lemnos has dozens of wild beaches where you can swim and sunbathe virtually alone a small nightlife scene and many cultural sites It is the eighth largest island in Greece so it is in line for the rst round of tax increases in autumn 2015 but it is far less wealthy than many smaller islands It has just over 3000 beds for visitors compared with tens of thousands on an island such as Rhodes We have been suffering economically in recent years and now we will suffer more said Lemnos Mayor Dimitris Marinakis When there is not enough money you reduce your consumption and the whole economy gets worse If taxes go up even more young people will leave warns Mayor Kakali who has worked to improve education on the island to help keep it an attractive place for families Because it is one of the smallest islands Agios Efstratios has until 2017 before the tax rise comes in Kakali hopes that because things change very fast in Greek politics the island might still avoid the tax If not though she plans to travel to Athens to remind the distant government what the tax rise would cost The truth is the government doesnt pay much attention to the islands of the north Aegean she said so I would take all the kids from our school to the gates of parliament to tell them There is still life in these islands,train,ELE,INT
177,Water scientists have given a very strong warning about the worlds food supplies They say that everyone may have to change to a vegetarian diet by 2050 We believe there will be an extra two billion people in the world by 2050 Humans get about 20 of their protein from animalbased products now but this may need to decrease to just 5 to feed these extra people say the worlds top water scientists There will not be enough water to produce food for the ninebillion population in 2050 if more people start eating like people in the West the report by Malik Falkenmark and colleagues at the Stockholm International Water Institute SIWI said There will be enough water if the percentage of animalbased foods is limited to 5 of total calories There are warnings that water shortages will limit food production At the same time Oxfam and the UN prepare for a possible second global food crisis in five years Prices for food items such as corn and wheat have increased nearly 50 on international markets since June The price increase has been caused by very bad droughts in the US and Russia and weak monsoon rains in Asia More than 18 million people already have serious food shortages across the Sahel Oxfam says that the effects of price increases will be very bad in developing countries that need to buy food from other countries including parts of Latin America North Africa and the Middle East Food shortages in 2008 led to fighting in 28 countries Changing to a vegetarian diet is one way to keep more water to grow food the scientists said Animal proteinrich food uses five to ten times more water than vegetarian food One third of the worlds farmland is used to grow crops to feed animals Nine hundred million people already dont have enough food and two million people are malnourished even though we are producing more food they said 70 of all water is used in farming and growing more food to feed an extra two billion people by 2050 will put more pressure on water and land The report was released at the start of the annual world water conference in Stockholm Sweden where 2500 politicians UN groups nongovernmental groups and researchers from 120 countries met to discuss global water supply problems Eating too much malnourishment and waste are all increasing We will need a new recipe to feed the world in the future said the reports editor Anders Jgerskog,Water scientists have given one of the strongest warnings ever about global food supplies They say that the worlds population may have to change almost completely to a vegetarian diet by 2050 to avoid catastrophic shortages Humans get about 20 of their protein from animalbased products now However this may need to decrease to just 5 to feed the extra two billion people expected to be alive by 2050 according to research by some of the worlds top water scientists There will not be enough water to produce food for the expected ninebillion population in 2050 if we follow current trends and changes towards diets common in western nations the report by Malik Falkenmark and colleagues at the Stockholm International Water Institute SIWI said There will be just enough water if the proportion of animalbased foods is limited to 5 of total calories Warnings that water scarcity could limit food production come at the same time as Oxfam and the UN prepare for a possible second global food crisis in five years Prices for items such as corn and wheat have risen nearly 50 on international markets since June The price increase has been caused by severe droughts in the US and Russia and weak monsoon rains in Asia More than 18 million people are already facing serious food shortages across the Sahel Oxfam says that the price increase will have a devastating effect in developing countries that rely heavily on food imports including parts of Latin America North Africa and the Middle East Food shortages in 2008 led to fighting and riots in 28 countries Changing to a vegetarian diet is one way to increase the amount of water available to grow more food in a world where the climate is becoming increasingly erratic the scientists said Animal proteinrich food uses five to ten times more water than a vegetarian diet One third of the worlds arable land is used to grow crops to feed animals Other options to feed people include stopping waste and increasing trade between countries that have a food surplus and countries that dont have enough food Nine hundred million people already go hungry and two billion people are malnourished although percapita food production continues to increase they said Seventy per cent of all water is used in agriculture and growing more food to feed an extra two billion people by 2050 will place greater pressure on water and land The report is being released at the start of the annual world water conference in Stockholm Sweden where 2500 politicians UN groups nongovernmental groups and researchers from 120 countries meet to discuss global water supply problems Competition for water between food production and other uses will increase pressure on essential resources the scientists said The UN predicts that we must increase food production by 70 by midcentury This will put additional pressure on our water resources which are already stressed at a time when we also need more water to satisfy global energy demand and to create electricity for the 13 billion people who are without it said the report Overeating malnourishment and waste are all increasing We will need a new recipe to feed the world in the future

91,What is it like to look at the last of something Sudan is the last male northern white rhino on the planet If he does not mate soon with one of two female northern white rhinos at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya there will be no more rhinos like them male or female born anywhere And they probably wont mate because Sudan is 42 so he is old There are only two other northern white rhinos in the world both in zoos both female The image seems to show that humans are gentle armed men guard Sudan and stay with him But of course it shows that humans are cruel Sudan is in danger from poachers The poachers kill rhinos and cut off their horns to sell them for medicine Sudan has had his horn cut off to stop the poachers but he is still in danger Sudan doesnt know how precious he is His eye is a sad black dot in his big face as he walks around the reserve with his guards His head is a marvellous thing It is a majestic rectangle of strong bone a head of pure strength How terrible that such a powerful head can be so vulnerable Sudan does not look so different from the artist Albrecht Durers rhinoceros from 1515 Durer was a Renaissance artist He drew an exotic beast from an exotic place In 1515 the ruler of Gujarat in India sent a live Indian rhinoceros to the king of Portugal The king sent it to the Pope but the ship sank and it died Human beings we always kill the things we love This hasnt changed since the Ice Age There are beautiful pictures of European woolly rhinos in caves in France that were painted up to 30000 years ago These ancient relatives of Sudan were gentle and powerful like Sudan A woolly rhino in Chauvet Cave seems young an animal full of life But the same people who painted such sensitive pictures of Ice Age rhinos helped to kill them all Today people love rhinos But at the same time people are killing more and more rhinos The northern white rhino is the rarest kind of African rhino There are more southern white rhinos and black rhinos But in some countries more and more people want rhino horn to use as a traditional medicine And this increases the poaching In 2007 13 rhinos were killed by poachers in South Africa In 2014 1215 rhinos were killed for their horns in South Africa The vulnerable northern white rhino has nearly been hunted to extinction in spite of the guards and their guns The poaching is totally out of control The Javan rhinoceros is also nearly extinct India has successfully protected the Indian rhinoceros but here too poaching is a problem Sudan is such a majestic animal Have we learned nothing since the Ice Age,What is it like to look at the last of something Sudan is the last male northern white rhino on the planet If he does not mate successfully soon with one of two female northern white rhinos at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya there will be no more rhinos like them male or female born anywhere And theres not much chance because Sudan is getting old at 42 and breeding efforts have so far failed Apart from these three animals there are only two other northern white rhinos in the world both in zoos both female It seems an image of human tenderness that Sudan is lovingly guarded by armed men who stand with him But of course it is an image of brutality Sudan is under threat from poachers who kill rhinos and cut off their horns to sell them for medicine in Asia Sudan is still in danger even though he has had his horn cut off to deter the poachers Sudan doesnt know how precious he is His eye is a sad black dot in his massive wrinkled face as he wanders the reserve with his guards His head is a marvellous thing It is a majestic rectangle of strong bone and leathery esh a head of pure strength How terrible that such a powerful head can in reality be so vulnerable Sudan does not look so different from the rhinoceros that Albrecht Durer portrayed in 1515 Durer was a Renaissance artist picturing an exotic beast from exotic lands In 1515 a live Indian rhinoceros was sent by the ruler of Gujarat in India to the king of Portugal The king sent it to the Pope but on the way the ship sank and it died Human beings we always kill the things we love We have been doing so since the Ice Age

rhino in Chauvet Cave seems agile and young a creature full of life But the same people who painted such sensitive portraits of Ice Age rhinos helped to kill them off Today many people really love rhinos but they are being killed in greater and greater numbers The northern white rhino is the rarest species of African rhino There are more southern white rhinos and black rhinos But the demand in some countries for rhino horn as a traditional medicine is increasing the poaching Many people believe that rhino horn can cure everything from u to cancer In 2007 13 rhinos were killed by poachers in South Africa In 2014 1215 rhinos were killed for their horns in South Africa The vulnerable northern white rhino has been hunted very nearly to extinction in spite of every precaution in spite of the guards and their guns Other varieties of African rhino are being hunted by poachers the situation is totally out of control The Javan rhinoceros is also on the verge of extinction India has successfully protected the Indian rhinoceros but here too poaching is a problem What a majestic creature Sudan is Have we learned nothing since the Ice Age,train,ELE,INT

137,Why do people want to be a football referee The top referees of the future smile when you ask them this question This season more people are criticizing referees For this reason some former referees have started to complain about standards That is quite significant because when you talk to referees it is obvious that they always support each other So why do they do want to be referees Why do referees spend hundreds of hours driving around the country Why do they work so hard to get the chance to make decisions on television in front of millions of people who criticize them and their ability with the help of many cameras and slowmotion replays You might get an answer from Lee Swabeys face He looks really happy after he blows the final whistle of a 21 win for Grimsby against Woking a match at level 5 of the English league system He gets what all referees want every time they referee a match Twentytwo handshakes he explains afterwards proudly The buzz as he calls it of a game that goes well is something he loves I wouldnt spend so much time away from my family if this wasnt so important to me Swabey is one of a group of new referees that the Professional Game Match Officials Limited PGMOL thinks is really good So Swabey knew they were watching him at that match PGMOLs chief Mike Riley was there and also his colleague Steve Dunn watching every move the officials made A few weeks earlier Riley Dunn and another former referee Peter Jones went to another level5 match to check another young referee John Brooks I hope to have the opportunity to work in the Premier League and referee at some of the top games in this country Brooks says Unfortunately the PGMOL only saw Brooks cancelling the match because of a frozen pitch It is all part of the experience Brooks needs to have before he can referee at more important games Brooks phoned his coach for advice and made the difficult but correct decision A little later the football club secretary arrived to pay the officials for their time the match fee at level 5 is 95 so it is clear that these men do not do it for the money Brooks like Swabey has clear ambitions to progress He knows lots of people will criticize him How does he feel when he watches football on TV and a referee is attacked Erm I dont feel great he admits I do sometimes wish people understood the time and effort we put in It is very easy to criticize a decision but we do everything to try to get these decisions right In certain situations you are going to be unpopular but if you are uncomfortable with that you are probably in the wrong job The former referees agree that the backup education and tools that todays referees have is very different from what they experienced in the past Riley as a young referee bought himself books on psychology and nutrition because there was no information on offer to him at all Things are very different for Brooks he has his own coach They talk every week discuss how his games have gone study film of key decisions and discuss how to improve He also has the support of a sports psychologist and an exercise regime to help him run 11km during a game The three former referees all agree that new technology in the sport is great It makes the referees job better and makes them more effective on the field of play says Riley A bad decision can stay with you for a while The rest of your life says Jones with a laugh,Why do it The elite football referees of the future smile when you ask them this question This season criticism of referees has increased so much that some former referees have started to complain about standards That is quite significant because when you talk to referees it is obvious that supporting each other through thick and thin is fundamental So why do they do it Why spend hundreds of hours driving up and down the country Why enforce rules some of which inevitably upset people Why try to climb the ladder until you get the chance to make decisions on television in front of millions of people who scrutinize you and your ability helped by many different camera angles and slowmotion replays You might get an answer from the face of Lee Swabey moments after he blows the final whistle of a 21 win for Grimsby over Woking a match at level 5 of the English league system He gets what all referees hope for every time they referee a match Twentytwo handshakes he explains afterwards proudly Symbolically a full set of handshakes plus a well done from both managers represents maximum satisfaction The buzz as he calls it of a game that passes smoothly is something he loves I wouldnt spend so much time away from my family if this didnt mean the world to me Swabey is one of a group of referees that is highly regarded by the Professional Game Match Officials Limited PGMOL So he knew he was being watched at that match PGMOLs chief Mike Riley was in attendance along with his colleague Steve Dunn watching every significant move the officials make A few weeks earlier Riley Dunn and another former referee Peter Jones made their way to another level5 match to watch another young referee John Brooks I hope to have the opportunity to get promoted to the Premier League and officiate some of the top games in this country Brooks says Unfortunately all the PGMOL delegation saw was the way Brooks handled the difficult situation of cancelling the match because of a frozen pitch It is all part of the experience Brooks needs to acquire before he is trusted with more important games the different problems that need dealing with often clubs are very reluctant to have a late postponement particularly when they have to pay all the staff who have come but will not receive any gate money Brooks phoned his coach for advice and made the difficult but correct decision A little later the football club secretary arrived with envelopes to pay the officials for their time the match fee at level 5 is 95 so it is clear that these men do not do it for the money Brooks like Swabey has clear ambitions to progress He knows that dealing with disappointments is a big part of that How does he feel watching football on TV when a referee gets vilified Erm not great he admits I do sometimes wish people understood the time and effort we put in It is very easy to criticize a decision but we do everything to try to get these decisions right In certain situations you are going to be unpopular but if you are uncomfortable with that you are probably in the wrong job The former referees agree that the backup education and tools that todays referees have is very different from what they experienced in their own days Riley as a young referee bought himself books on psychology and nutrition as there was no information on offer to him at all Contrast this with Brooks who has a coach he can call They consult weekly discuss how his games have gone study footage of key decisions and work out how to improve He also has the support of a sports psychologist Liam Slack for regular guidance and an exercise regime to help him handle the 11km he runs during a game Brooks says psychology is vital in his development One of the things we have talked about is forgetting decisions and moving on he explains There may be a big decision to make in the first 30 seconds of the game Once you have made that you need to stay focused for the next 89 minutes and not be wondering whether that was correct or worrying about that decision Liam has taught us some techniques for forgetting that decision Working with the sports psychologist is really important for mental toughness On the subject of technology the three former referees are unanimous in their support of it We are all in favour of anything that makes the referees job better and makes them more effective on the pitch says Riley Minimizing mistakes is the aim After all a bad decision can stick with you for a while The rest of your life adds Jones with a chuckle,train,ELE,INT
188,Angela Erdmann never knew her grandfather He died in 1946 six years before she was born But on Tuesday April 8th 2014 she described the extraordinary moment when she received a message in a bottle 101 years after he threw it into the Baltic Sea The bottle is possibly the worlds oldest message in a bottle It was presented to Erdmann by the museum that is now exhibiting it in Germany It was very surprising Erdmann 62 said when she described how she found out about the bottle A man came to my door and told me he had post from my grandfather Then he told me that someone had found a message in a bottle and that on the card was my grandfathers name Her visitor was a familytree researcher who found her in Berlin after someone gave the letter to a museum in the northern city of Hamburg The brown beer bottle was in the water for 101 years A fisherman found it Holger von Neuhoff a curator at the museum said this bottled message was the oldest he had ever seen There are documents without the bottle that are older and they are in the museum he said But with the bottle and the document this is certainly the oldest at the moment It is in very good condition Researchers believe that Erdmanns grandfather Richard Platz threw the bottle into the sea when he was on a hike in 1913 He was 20 years old at the time A lot of the message on the postcard was impossible to read but the address in Berlin on the front of the card was legible Platz asked the person who found it to send the postcard to his home address He also included two stamps from that time that were also in the bottle so the finder would not have to pay for postage Erdmann said But he did not think it would take 101 years She said she was moved by the arrival of the message but she did not known her grandfather because he died at the age of 54 six years before she was born I knew very little about my grandfather But I found out that he was a writer He was very openminded and he believed in freedom and that everyone should respect each other she said He did a lot for the young and later travelled with his wife and two daughters It was wonderful because I could see where my roots came from Erdmann said she also liked culture and travelling around the world just like her grandfather She described herself as openminded too She was very happy to receive the bottled message she said but she hoped other people would not do what her grandfather did and throw bottles with messages into the sea Today the sea is so full of bottles and rubbish that we shouldnt throw more in there she said The message and the bottle will be on display at Hamburgs Maritime Museum until the beginning of May 2014 Then experts will try to decipher the rest of the text It is not clear what will happen to the bottle after that

166,A fifth of young adults in the UK are staying in the family home until they are at least 26 and a fifth are not paying any rent A recent survey found that the percentage of adults who live at home was different in different parts of the country it was less than 9 in the East Midlands and more than double that in London where house prices and rents are highest Many young people pay their parents some money to live at home but 20 pay nothing at all Young adults are suffering from low wages and high rents The cost of renting is too much so young people who want to buy a house cant save enough to get on the property ladder Recent research showed half of tenants were unable to save any money for a deposit and a quarter could only save 100 or less each month Mortgages are cheaper than ever before but people who have large deposits still get the best mortgages As a result of this more and more young adults are returning to the family home to save money And parents who cannot afford to give their children money for a deposit seem happy to let them live at home again The survey found that 28 of adults live at home because they are trying to save for a deposit But it also found that 30 are not saving any money Michael Day 30 who lives with his parents in Bristol says its difficult to save for a mortgage deposit when rents are so high Rents for a onebedroom home in the city are between 500 and 800 a month Buying a similar flat would cost about 130000 I dont really want to move out to rent because its more than a mortgage but you need such a big deposit to get a mortgage Sue Green who works for Saga a business that sells insurance to people over 50 said most parents did not think their children would live with them in their 20s or 30s Most will be more than happy to have them in the family home rentfree because it might help their kids get on the property ladder sooner she said Children who dont pay rent may pay for other things like groceries or they may do odd jobs around the home Angus Hanton of the Intergenerational Foundation said older people caused the housing crisis and we should not blame younger people for staying at home The under30s earn on average 20 less since the 2008 downturn Rents and car insurance have never been so high he said and many jobs zerohour and shortterm contracts turn younger workers into secondclass citizens Jenna Gavin 29 lives in the family home where she grew up She works as a medical receptionist nearby so she wants to stay in the area But renting a onebedroom flat would cost more than 420 a month not including bills which would use a lot of her earnings I dont want to rent I dont want to spend all that money and have nothing at the end she said Ive thought about buying and seen mortgage advisers but I just cant borrow enough to get on the property ladder She is trying to save for a deposit Its difficult to save enough money even a 5 deposit is such a lot of money she said Her parents are happy not to ask her to pay rent They want me to try to save and I do other things I buy food and I do things around the house She gets on with her parents and has the same room that she had when she was 14 but she said she had always imagined she would have her own home before she was 30,Some people call it the hotel of mum and dad A fifth of young adults are staying in the family home until they are at least 26 and the same proportion are not paying a penny towards their keep A recent survey found that the proportion of adults living at home varied around the country from just under 9 in the East Midlands to more than double that in London where house prices and rents are highest While many around the country contributed financially it found that 20 were paying nothing at all Young adults are squeezed by low wages and high rents while those who want to buy a property are finding the monthly cost of renting is preventing them from saving enough to get on the housing ladder Recent research showed half of tenants were unable to save a penny towards a deposit while a quarter could only save 100 or less each month Mortgages are cheaper than ever before thanks to record low interest rates but the best deals are still only given to people with large deposits As a result of this young adults are increasingly returning to the family home to save money and parents who cannot afford to offer their children a large sum of money seem happy to help The survey found that 28 of adults were living at home because they were trying to save for a deposit However it also found that 30 were not saving any money Michael Day 30 who lives with his parents in Bristol says he has been caught between paying high rents and saving for a mortgage deposit Rents for a onebedroom home in the city are between 500 and 800 a month while buying a similar property would cost about 130000 I dont really want to move out to rent as its more than a mortgage but you need such a big deposit to get a mortgage so its a vicious circle He does not want to share with strangers so his options are limited At home he pays a nominal rent to cover bills and is able to keep the rest of his earnings from his job He admits that instead of saving he spends his spare money on golf and holidays You need so much money that I will have to save for the foreseeable future he said Because its been so difficult Ive been going on holiday and enjoying it Sue Green of Saga a business that sells insurance to people over 50 said the majority of parents may not have planned to have their children living with them in their 20s or 30s Most will be more than happy to have them in the family home rentfree because it might help their kids get on the property ladder sooner she said Children who dont pay rent may contribute in other ways like buying groceries family takeaways or doing odd jobs around the home Angus Hanton of the Intergenerational Foundation thinktank said older generations were the architects of the housing crisis and children should not be blamed for staying at home The under30s have suffered a reduction in average incomes of about 20 since the 2008 downturn Rents and car insurance have never been so high and mortgage lending rules are now stricter for the young but not for older buytolet investors who squeeze out the young he said Many jobs on offer zerohour and shortterm contracts are turning younger workers into secondclass citizens Rather than blaming the young we should help them so they can afford to build lives of their own Jenna Gavin 29 lives in Southport Merseyside in the family

185,Volcanoes hurricanes and earthquakes can make a city totally disappear But there are two other things that can make it disappear too water and sand One hundred years ago Venice one of the most beautiful and lowlying cities in the world used to ood about ten times a year Now its lowest point Piazza San Marco only three feet above sea level oods approximately 100 times a year But rising sea levels are not the only cause In many parts of the world the land is also sinking In Venice the city sank by 20cm between 1950 and 1970 Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam is also sinking by about 2cm a year but the situation in Jakarta is much worse it is sinking 10 to 20cm every year In the past three decades the city has sunk four metres The Indonesian capital has pumped out so much water to support its population that the land above is too dry This is creating a bowl There are many plans to save Venice and Ho Chi Minh City and Jakarta are taking the problem seriously But it is not same in Miami where politicians will not accept that the city has a serious problem There are three main problems in Miami It is less than ten feet above sea level an increasing number of tropical storms are ooding the city and it is built on porous rock which absorbs the rising seawater This water then lls the citys foundations and comes up through drains and pipes This forces sewage upwards and pollutes the citys fresh water It is possible that it may one day be impossible to live in Miami In the Maldives the populations of whole islands may leave their homes The capital is Male It has a population of 153379 and is only four feet above sea level Male has built a tenfoot sea wall which cost 63 million But in the long term Male and the rest of the islands will only be safe if sea levels stop rising In Africa the Sahara is getting bigger it is moving south at a rate of 30 miles per year This is a problem for people who live in northern Mauritania People may have to leave the Californian resort of Rancho Mirage near Palm Springs in the next decade The problem in California is not caused by global warming the problem is that there are too many people there In 1870 the total population was only half a million but now the state is home to 38 million people And these people have 32 million cars Every person in Rancho Mirage uses more than 200 gallons of water every day This is causing a manmade drought They have reduced water use by 25 but this will probably not make much difference The longterm answer in Californias desert is for people to leave some cities Fire is a growing problem to towns and cities in America in fact forest res cause the most damage after bad storms There were 800 major re disasters there between 1953 and 2014 A new report by the USDA Forest Service shows the increasing number of towns and cities that are particularly vulnerable to wild re Many cities are ghting a losing battle against nature but is it possible to choose the worlds most vulnerable city Natural disasters are very dif cult to predict but the future for Male does look very bad Its new sea wall might continue to work but the islands around the Maldives capital are going to disappear soon And if they disappear Males reason for existing disappears too,Apart from volcanoes hurricanes and earthquakes there are two key things that can make a city disintegrate or even totally disappear water and sand A century ago Venice one of the most beautiful and lowlying cities in the world used to ood around ten times a year Nowadays its lowest point Piazza San Marco only three feet above sea level is inundated with water approximately 100 times a year But rising sea levels are not the only cause In many parts of the world the land is also sinking In Venice subsoil compaction a result of industrial exploitation of the surrounding area lowered the city by 20cm between 1950 and 1970 Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam is also sinking by about 2cm a year but thats nothing compared to Jakarta which is dropping 10 to 20cm each year In the past three decades the city has sunk roughly four metres Unfortunately for the Indonesian capital it has pumped out so much groundwater to support its population that the land above is drying out and compacting this has created a bowl Rivers that used to ow through the city down to the sea have had to be diverted because they cannot drain uphill While there are many plans to save Venice and Ho Chi Minh City and Jakarta are taking the problem seriously the same cannot be said for Miami where politicians refuse to admit the city has a serious environmental problem There are three problems in Miami It is less than ten feet above sea level an increasing number of tropical storms are inundating the city and it is built on porous rock which is absorbing the rising seawater This water then lls the citys foundations and comes up through drains and pipes forcing sewage upwards and polluting its fresh water It is possible that Miami may one day become uninhabitable In the Maldives the populations of whole islands are now considering abandoning their homes The capital Male population 153379 and only four feet above sea level has built a tenfoot sea wall at a cost of 63 million but long term only a stabilization of rising sea levels will save it and the rest of the islands In Africa deserti cation is causing the Sahara to spread south at a rate of 30 miles per year threatening settlements in northern Mauritania Over the past 20 years for example the desert has grown by more than 260 acres around the trading and religious centre of Chinguetti where the population has declined from 20000 people in the midtwentieth century to just a few thousand now Trading has almost completely stopped as sand piles up in the streets Likewise the Californian resort of Rancho Mirage near Palm Springs may have to be abandoned in the next decade This city is just one example of a problem caused not so much by global warming as human overexpansion Californias dream of farming the desert made sense while its total population remained around half a million in 1870 but now the state is home to 38 million people who own 32 million vehicles The daily water use in Rancho Mirage is more than 200 gallons per person which is causing a manmade drought A 25 cut in water use has been implemented but this is unlikely to stabilize the resort which is surrounded by sand and dust The longterm answer in Californias desert is likely to be the abandonment of some cities Fire is a growing threat to urban settlements in America in fact forest res cause the most damage after severe storms with 800 major re disasters there between 1953 and 2014 A new report by the USDA Forest Service maps the increasing number of urban locations that are particularly vulnerable to wild re Similarly in Australia some of Victorias resorts and several Melbourne suburbs have been placed on a list of the states 52 most vulnerable bush re spots because longterm droughts are making trees highly combustible Its unlikely that a forest re will ever destroy an entire city but a succession of res could make it uninhabitable Many cities are ghting a losing battle against nature but is it possible to identify the worlds most vulnerable city Natural events are very dif cult to predict but Males future looks particularly bad because even if its new sea wall continues to be effective the islands around the Maldives capital are going to disappear before too long And if they disappear Males raison detre disappears too,train,ELE,INT
36,Japanese entrepreneur Takahito Iguchi thinks Google Glasses are not cool He may be right Theres already a website with pictures of people wearing them the people look ridiculous or smug or more often both If you search Google Images for Google Glasses one of the first pictures is of a large naked man wearing them in the shower Iguchi hopes that this is Googles weak point He has designed some glasses that are a bit more stylish and a bit more Japanese Iguchis glasses arent really glasses they are a piece of metal with a camera and a very small projector The glasses are called Telepathy One Since he first presented them to the public in Texas they have attracted 5 million from investors Like Glass you will be able to buy Telepathy One in 2014 Its a more simple version of Google Glass Glass has many uses you can surf the internet read emails take photographs but Telepathy will be more of a communication machine Connected to your phone it will allow realtime visual and audio sharing Youll be able to post photos and videos of what you see on Facebook or send them as an email Or see and speak to a video image of a friend It will help bring you close to your friends and family We are very focused on the communication and sharing possibilities says Iguchi who has worked in the Japanese technology industry for 20 years Im a visionary he says I have a dream that people will understand other people When I go to London I am a stranger But I believe that everyone wants people to understand them and to understand other people And with the glasses you can know more information about people before you even speak to them When Iguchi was growing up Japanese technology ruled the world they had the Sony Walkman which was as popular as the iPhone Now to compete he has had to leave Tokyo and go to Silicon Valley Tokyo is very rich in fashion and culture but its still an island Its isolated There is no way to expand But in Silicon Valley everyone is from everywhere Its where you come to connect with the world They will make the glasses in Japan and the software in the US It was easy to build the prototype of Telepathy One Iguchi says We have every sort of technology in Tokyo The problem is presenting it to the world The top manufacturers all want to work with him he says because they have the technology they just find it difficult to sell it There needs to be a story to the product Apple had a story with the iPod 1000 songs in your pocket And Steve Jobs was inspired by Akio Morita the cofounder of Sony and he inspired me so maybe it will come in a circle Like Steve Jobs Iguchi is a confident man but his strong Japanese accent makes it difficult to understand him It is possible that this fact helped him to find the idea for Telepathy One When he visited London he stayed with someone he didnt know He was not my friend but I talked with him for three hours and now he is my friend That is how long it takes to understand each other to share our feelings and background and career Maybe Telepathy makes that quicker If you are getting information from the cloud and social networks that will happen more easily Iguchi hopes that Telepathy One will help people see other peoples point of view As a student he explains he studied philosophy during the day and taught himself how to code at night And one day I opened the door of my apartment and I suddenly realized that everything is code Everything is coded and can be shared between humans And everything can be encoded and decoded And if code can be exchanged between humans that will end all war,The problem with Google Glasses says Takahito Iguchi is that theyre not cool He may be right Theres already a website dedicated to people wearing them looking either ridiculous or smug or more often both Search Google Images and one of the first hits is a picture of a large naked man wearing them in the shower And its this that Iguchi a Japanese entrepreneur hopes may be Googles Achilles heel He is launching a competitor that is a bit more stylish A bit more Blade Runner A bit more Japanese Iguchis augmented reality glasses arent really glasses they are more a single piece of metal with a camera and a tiny projector They are called Telepathy One and since they were presented to the public for the first time in Austin Texas they have attracted 5m of venture capital Like Glass Telepathy One is due to launch in 2014 Its a simplified version of Google Glass Glass has a range of uses you can surf the internet read emails take photographs but Telepathy will be more of a communication device Connected via Bluetooth to your phone it will focus on realtime visual and audio sharing Youll be able to post photos and videos from your line of vision on Facebook or send them as an email or see and speak to a video image of a friend It will help bring you close to your friends and family We are very focused on the communication and sharing possibilities says Iguchi who has worked in the Japanese technology industry for 20 years Of course not everyone wants to get closer to the man in the futuristic headset I tell him Iguchi shakes his head Im a visionary I have a dream that people will understand other people When I go to London I am a stranger Sometimes I feel fear But I believe that everyone wants to be understood and to understand each other And with this device you can know more information about people before you even speak to them Compared to Google Telepathy is a minnow but Iguchi doesnt seem to worry In his shared office space in San Francisco a cool converted warehouse he quotes Sun Tzus The Art of War and says that even tiny armies can sometimes beat powerful forces When he was growing up Japanese technology ruled the world the Sony Walkman was the iPhone of its day Now to compete hes had to leave Tokyo and go to Silicon Valley Tokyo is very rich in fashion and culture but its still an island Its isolated There is not any way to expand Whereas in Silicon Valley everyone is from everywhere Its where you come to connect globally The hardware will be made in Japan and he is putting together a team of software engineers in the US to develop its applications Building the prototype of Telepathy One was easy Iguchi says We have every sort of technology in Tokyo It is presenting it to the world that is the challenge The top manufacturers all want to work with him he says because they have the technology they just struggle to sell it There needs to be a story to the product Like Apple did with the iPod 1000 songs in your pocket And Steve Jobs was inspired by Akio Morita the cofounder of Sony and he inspired me so maybe it will come in a circle Maybe He certainly has the confidence of Jobs but with a thick Japanese accent he sometimes struggles to make himself understood a fact that may have contributed to his idea for Telepathy One When he went to London to present the headset he stayed in an Airbnb The house owner was not my friend but I talked with him for three hours and now he is my friend That is how long it takes to understand each other to share our feelings and background and career Maybe Telepathy makes that quicker If you are getting info from the cloud and social networks that will happen more easily Iguchi hopes that seeing somebody elses I suddenly realized that everything is code Everything is coded and is shareable between humans And everything can be encoded and decoded And if code is exchangeable between humans that will end all war literal point of view will help you to see their metaphorical point of view As a student he explains he studied philosophy by day and taught himself how to code by night And one day I opened the door of my apartment and,train,ELE,INT
73,To tourists Amsterdam still seems very liberal Recently the citys Mayor told them that the coffee shops that sell marijuana would stay open although there is a new national law to stop drug tourism But the Dutch capital has a plan to send antisocial neighbours to scum villages made from shipping containers and so maybe now people wont think it is a liberal city any more The Mayor Eberhard van der Laan says his new plan to solve the problem of antisocial behaviour will cost 810000 The plan is hopes to protect victims of abuse and homophobia The camps where antisocial families will live for three to six months have been called scum villages because last year Geert Wilders the farright politician said that offenders should go to a village for scum Bartho Boer a spokesman for the Mayor says that the plans are not illiberal We want to defend the liberal values of Amsterdam he says We want everyone to be who he and she is whether they are gay and lesbian or try to stop violence and are then victims of harassment We want to defend them According to Boer the villages are not for a problem neighbour who has the stereo too loud on Saturday night but people who are very violent and in a clear situation where a victim is harassed again and again People found guilty of violent harassment will be evicted from their homes and put in temporary homes including shipping containers in industrial areas of the city We call it a living container says Boer The containers have showers and kitchens and have been used as student accommodation They are going to use the containers because they want to show that if people are antisocial they do not get better accommodation One Dutch newspaper wrote that in the 19th century antisocial people were moved to villages in Drenthe and Overijssel which soon became slums But Boer says that the government has learned from past mistakes and is not planning to put antisocial families together They are scum houses not scum villages says Boer because we dont want to put more than one of these families in the same area After a maximum of six months in these houses in different parts of the city the families will get permanent homes The city government expects to move about ten families a year which starts in 2013 Police will watch the temporary accommodation but antisocial families will also be able to see doctors and social workers We will take care of them so the whole situation is not going to repeat at the new house they are in says Boer,To tourists Amsterdam still seems very liberal Recently the citys Mayor assured them that the citys marijuanaselling coffee shops would stay open despite a new national law to prevent drug tourism But the Dutch capitals plans to send nuisance neighbours to scum villages made from shipping containers may damage its reputation for tolerance The Mayor Eberhard van der Laan says his controversial new 810000 policy to deal with antisocial behaviour is to protect victims of abuse and homophobia The camps where antisocial families will be rehoused for three to six months have been called scum villages because the policy is similar to proposals from Geert Wilders the farright politician who last year said that repeat offenders should be sent to a village for scum Bartho Boer a spokesman for the Mayor says that the plans are not illiberal We want to defend the liberal values of Amsterdam he says We want everyone to be who he and she is whether they are gay and lesbian or resist violence and are then victims of harassment We as a society want to defend them According to Boer the villages are not for a problem neighbour who has the stereo too loud on Saturday night but people who are extremely violent and intimidating and in a clear situation where a victim is being harassed again and again People found guilty of causing extreme havoc will be evicted and put in basic temporary homes including converted shipping containers in industrial areas of the city We call it a living container says Boer Housing antisocial families in these units which have showers and kitchens and have been used as student accommodation will mean that they are not rewarded for their behaviour by being put in better accommodation Dutch newspaper the Parool has written that in the 19th century troublemakers were moved to villages in Drenthe and Overijssel which rapidly became slums But Boer insists that the government has learned from past mistakes and is not planning to house antisocial families together It would be more accurate to call them scum houses than scum villages says Boer because we dont want to put more than one of these families in the same area After a maximum of six months in these houses in different parts of the city the families will be found permanent homes The city government expects to move around ten families a year into this programme which starts in 2013 The temporary accommodation will be heavily policed but antisocial families will also have access to doctors social workers and parole officers They are taken care of so the whole situation is not going to repeat at the new house they are in says Boer,train,ELE,INT
186,In the West people do not usually eat insects But in some parts of the world insects are an important food and in spring 2013 there will be an effort to show people that eating insects is not disgusting And we may soon be able to buy insects in supermarkets In April there will be a festival in London Pestival 2013 where there will be a discussion about the question of eating insects The festival will include a restaurant by the Nordic Food Lab the Scandinavian team behind the Danish restaurant Noma which brought extremely popular insect dishes to Claridges hotel in London in 2013 Noma has been named the best restaurant in the world by Restaurant magazine for three years Its chef Ren Redzepi says that ants taste like lemon and a mixture of grasshoppers and moth larvae tastes like a strong fish sauce Bee larvae make a sweet mayonnaise used instead of eggs and scientists find new ways to use insects all the time In March a BBC documentary will show a food writer eating deepfried locusts and barbecued spiders But behind all the jokes there is a very serious message Many experts believe that if humans eat insects it will be very good for the environment The UNs Food and Agriculture Organization FAO gives money to projects that show people they can eat and farm insects in southeast Asia and Africa In these places about two billion people already eat insects and larvae as a normal part of their diet In 2012 the FAO published a list of 1909 edible species of insect and plans a major international conference on this valuable food source in 2013 There are lots of insects there are 40 tonnes of insects for every person in the world so they will not become endangered I know its taboo to eat bugs in the West but why not Redzepi said You go to southeast Asia and this is a common thing You read about it from all over the world that people are eating insects We eat honey and honey is the vomit of a bee Think of that next time you put it into your tea He said that the basic idea behind Nordic Food Lab is that you can eat everything Insects are very important to life on Earth and they are the most diverse group of animals on the planet there are more than a million species But most people hate them and often kill them In the next 30 years the planets human population will increase to nine billion Already one billion people do not get enough food The increase will put more pressure on agricultural land water forests fisheries and resources and also food and energy supplies The cost of meat is increasing it costs more money now but also people have to destroy a lot of rainforest to make fields or to grow food for cows Cows also make methane The farming of cows pigs and sheep makes very big amounts of greenhouse gases 35 of the planets methane 65 of its nitrous oxide and 9 of the carbon dioxide Edible insects make fewer gases contain highquality protein vitamins and amino acids and only need a quarter of the food that sheep need to make the same amount of protein You can grow them on organic waste China is already building huge maggot farms Zimbabwe is growing caterpillars and Laos is developing an insectharvesting project One study says that eating crickets and locusts and not eating pork and beef could help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 95,Insects are not usually seen as food except in a few regions of the world but now they are crawling closer and closer to our plates In spring 2013 there will be an effort to show people that eating insects is not disgusting and also an attempt to put insects on supermarket shelves In April there will be a festival in London Pestival 2013 where the consumption of creepycrawlies will be discussed The festival will include a restaurant by the Nordic Food Lab the Scandinavian team behind the Danish restaurant Noma which brought dishes that included ants to Claridges hotel in Mayfair in 2012 an event that was mostly sold out Noma has been named the worlds best restaurant by Restaurant magazine for three years Its chef Ren Redzepi says that ants taste like lemon and a pure of fermented grasshoppers and moth larvae tastes like a strong fish sauce Bee larvae make a sweet mayonnaise used instead of eggs and scientists are constantly finding new ways to use insects In March a BBC documentary will show food writer Stefan Gates looking for and eating deepfried locusts and barbecued spiders But behind all the jokes there is a very serious message Many experts believe there is a clear environmental benefit to humans eating insects The UNs Food and Agriculture Organization FAO has been funding projects since 2011 that aim to promote the eating and farming of insects in southeast Asia and Africa where an estimated two billion people already eat insects and larvae as a regular part of their diet In 2012 the FAO published a list of 1909 edible species of insect and plans a major international conference on this valuable food source in 2013 there are 40 tonnes of insects so there is not too much chance that they will become endangered I know its taboo to eat bugs in the western world but why not Redzepi has said You go to southeast Asia and this is a common thing You read about it from all over the world that people are eating insects If you like mushrooms youve eaten so many worms you cannot imagine But also we eat honey and honey is the vomit of a bee Think of that next time you put it into your tea He said that the basic idea behind Nordic Food Lab was Nothing is not edible Insects are critical to life on Earth and with more than a million species are the most diverse group of creatures on the planet but they are misunderstood hated and often killed by humans just because they are there Over the next 30 years the planets human population will increase to nine billion Already one billion people do not get enough food The increase will put more pressure on agricultural land water forests fisheries and resources as well as nutrients and energy supplies The cost of meat is rising not just in terms of money but also in terms of the amount of rainforest that is destroyed for fields or to grow food for cattle There is also the issue of methane produced by cows In terms of greenhouse gas emissions the contribution by livestock farming is enormous 35 of the planets methane 65 of its nitrous oxide and 9 of the carbon dioxide Edible insects produce fewer gases contain highquality protein vitamins and amino acids and need only a quarter of the food that sheep need and half that of pigs and chickens to produce the same amount of protein They produce fewer greenhouse gases and less ammonia than cows and can be grown on organic waste China is already successfully setting up huge maggot farms Zimbabwe has a thriving caterpillar industry and Laos was given nearly 500000 by the FAO to develop an insectharvesting project A study by FoodServiceWarehousecom suggested that giving up pork and beef and eating crickets and locusts instead could help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 95 But perhaps the fairest thing about eating worms and insects comes when we are dead then they get a chance to eat

37,Dr Ben Brabon of Edgehill University teaches a MOOC a massive open online course The course is one of only two accredited MOOCs in the UK at the moment Brabon says that many students enrol on MOOCs because they are free and they enjoy communicating with other students MOOCs have no entry tests and no fees so MOOC students behave very differently from students on normal higher education courses MOOCs are the newest idea to try to make higher education available to everyone Companies are investing a lot of money in new websites that offer sophisticated and interactive courses to tens of thousands of students Investors hope to find a business model for MOOCs that will make them profitable They could earn money by finding out why and when millions of students enrol interact with their material submit their assignments message each other and stop the course Nobody can say exactly who MOOCs are for Universities that want to attract feepaying international students onto postgraduate courses by showing them their best programmes online Students in developing countries who really want access to firstworld universities Employees who wish to develop their professional knowledge People without qualifications who want to use MOOCs as a bridge to higher education Or hobby learners who want to learn about a subject they find interesting MOOCs may be popular at the beginning but very few people complete them says Dr Brabon His literature course had 1000 enrolments but only 31 people completed the course And almost all of those had a first degree or had been educated to degree level he says So it seems MOOCs do not make higher education available to people who couldnt go into higher education before Learning online is a different thing and needs quite advanced learning skills says David Kernohan an expert in digital technology With MOOCs theres very little support the student does not get any individual attention Students get support from other students in online discussions This may mean that online study is unattractive or difficult for someone without highlevel qualifications but it suggests that MOOCs could be a really good tool for continuing education he added The number of parttime students has reduced as the cost of studying at university increases so could open and free courses provide a new path to university education Could you teach a whole degree via MOOCs I dont think thats how MOOCs work says Brabon Instead he suggests blended learning that combines a campus experience with a MOOC also perhaps using MOOCs to create a global degree with students taking courses from across the world might be possible But thats in the future At present the course content and assessment standards of MOOCs have no quality assurance so employers will not be impressed by them Accreditation is now essential for MOOCs so academics and employers will believe they are of good quality says Brabon Some people hope that MOOCs will bring the best of firstworld teaching to students in less developed countries Others believe that universities could use MOOCs to advertise their campus courses to bigger numbers of feepaying students from outside the EU Mike Sharples chair of Educational Technology doesnt agree MOOCs are mainly a way to publicize and share universities best teachers They also encourage interaction and feedback from students around the world he says He believes that attracting international students onto university courses is not the main aim of MOOCs But they could certainly be a very clever marketing idea as he says that if 20000 people enrol on a MOOC well you only need 20 of those to enrol afterwards to have a masters course In South America China and countries in Africa there are many people who want to learn and some of the worlds best courses are now online adds Sharples If people are fascinated by learning then why not The real challenge is to allow those countries not just to study MOOCs but also to create them,Dr Ben Brabon of Edgehill University teaches a MOOC a massive open online course in literature The course is one of only two accredited MOOCs currently on offer in the UK According to Brabon many students enrol on MOOCs because they are free and they enjoy communicating with other students MOOCs have no enrolment criteria and no fees so students behave very differently from students on traditional higher education courses MOOCs are the newest big idea to try to make higher education available to everyone A lot of money is being invested in new online platforms that deliver sophisticated and interactive courses to tens of thousands of students Investors hope to find a business model for MOOCs that will make them profitable so far courses have depended on universities funding their star lecturers course design and online teaching time One way of making a return on the investment might be studying data about how why and when millions of students sign up interact with their material submit their assignments message each other and drop out of the course One of the questions about the future direction of MOOCs is that nobody can yet say who exactly they benefit Universities who want to attract feepaying international students onto postgraduate courses by showing off their best programmes online Students in developing countries who want access to firstworld universities Employees who wish to develop their professional knowledge People without qualifications who want to use MOOCs as a bridge to higher education Or hobby learners who want to learn about a subject area in which they have an interest MOOCs may be popular at the beginning but they have very poor completion rates says Brabon His literature course had 1000 enrolments and 31 completions And almost all of those had a first degree or had been educated to degree level he says So MOOCs may not be opening up higher education to sectors of the population it hasnt reached yet Learning online is a different thing and needs quite advanced learning skills confirms David Kernohan progamme manager for eLearning Innovation at a charity that promotes the use of digital technologies in UK education and research With MOOCs theres very little support available the student does not get any individual attention Instead they get peer support such as online discussion forums Although this may mean that online study is unattractive or difficult for someone without highlevel qualifications it suggests he says that MOOCs could be a really good tool for continuing education At a time when the number of parttime students has fallen sharply because the price of a degree is rising could this type of open and freetoaccess course provide a new path to universitylevel education Could an entire degree be taught via MOOCs I dont think thats how MOOCs work says Brabon Instead he suggests a blended approach that combines a campus experience with a MOOC also perhaps using MOOCs to create a global degree with students taking courses from across the world might be possible But thats a little way into the future For now MOOC completion certificates have no quality assurance on either the course content or its assessment standards so employers will not be impressed by them Accreditation is now essential for MOOCs if they want to gain credibility with academics and employers says Brabon Some people are idealistic about MOOCs they want to bring the best of firstworld teaching to students in less developed countries But theres cynicism too with the suggestion that universities could use MOOCs to advertise their oncampus courses to bigger numbers of lucrative students from outside the EU Mike Sharples chair of Educational Technology doesnt agree with that cynicism MOOCs are mainly a way to publicize and share universities best teaching talent as well as encouraging interaction and getting feedback from students around the world he says He believes that enrolling international students onto university courses is only a secondary objective of MOOCs but they could certainly be a very clever marketing idea as he observes that if 20000 people sign up to a MOOC well you only need 20 of those to enrol afterwards to run a masters In South America China and countries in Africa there is a huge appetite for learning and some of the worlds best courses are now offered online

107,Poorer countries will be most affected by climate change in the next century Sea levels will rise there will be stronger cyclones warmer days and nights more rainfall and larger and longer heatwaves says a new report The last big United Nations UN report in 2007 said there would be temperature rises of 6 C or more by the end of the century Scientists now think this will not happen but average land and sea temperatures will probably continue rising during this century possibly becoming 4 C hotter than now That rise would ruin crops and make life in many cities too hot As temperatures rise and oceans become warmer there will be big changes in annual rainfall in tropical and subtropical regions says the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC report released in Stockholm and published online in September 2013 East Africa can expect more short rainfalls and west Africa should expect heavier monsoons Burma Bangladesh and India can expect stronger cyclones elsewhere in southern Asia there will probably be heavier summer rainfalls Indonesia may receive less rainfall between July and October but the coastal regions around the south China Sea and Gulf of Thailand can expect more rainfall when cyclones hit the land Rainfall patterns will change Northern countries for example in Europe or North America will probably receive more rainfall but many subtropical dry regions will likely get less rain said the report The report also said that the monsoon season will probably start earlier and last longer Scientists in developing countries are happy with the report The IPCC says that climate change is real and happening much more strongly than before We are already seeing the effects of climate change in Bangladesh and across south Asia Its not news to us Most developing countries are experiencing climate change now They do not need the IPCC to tell them that the weather is changing said Saleemul Huq director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development Scientists have also lowered their predictions for sealevel rises Sea levels will probably rise an average of 4062 cm by 2100 But many millions of people living in the developing worlds great cities including Lagos and Calcutta are in danger Weather disasters are also more likely in a warmer world the report says The number of tropical cyclones will probably not change but they may become more intense with stronger winds and heavier rainfall Life in many developing country cities could become very diffi cult especially because city temperatures are already higher than those in the countryside Much higher temperatures could reduce the length of the growing period in some parts of Africa by up to 20 the report said The charity Oxfam said that world hunger would get worse because climate changes hurt crop production They said the number of people at risk of hunger might increase by 10 to 20 by 2050 The changing climate is already hurting the fi ght against hunger and it looks like it will get worse said Oxfam A hot world is a hungry world,Lowincome countries will continue to be the most affected by humaninduced climate change over the next century They will experience gradual sealevel rises stronger cyclones warmer days and nights more unpredictable rainfall and larger and longer heatwaves according to a recent report The last major United Nations UN assessment in 2007 predicted temperature rises of 6 C or more by the end of the century That is now thought unlikely by scientists but average land and sea temperatures are expected to continue rising throughout this century possibly reaching 4 C above present levels enough to devastate crops and make life in many cities unbearably hot As temperatures rise and oceans warm tropical and subtropical regions will see sharp changes in annual rainfall says the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC report released in Stockholm and published online in September East Africa can expect increased short rainfalls and west Africa should expect heavier monsoons Burma Bangladesh and India can expect stronger cyclones elsewhere in southern Asia heavier summer rains are anticipated Indonesia may receive less rainfall between July and October but the coastal regions around the south China Sea and Gulf of Thailand can expect increased rainfall extremes when cyclones hit the land In the long term rainfall patterns will change Northern countries such as those in Europe or North America are expected to receive more rainfall but many subtropical arid and semiarid regions will likely experience less rain said the reports authors They added that the monsoon season is likely to start earlier and last longer Scientists in developing countries and commentators have welcomed the report which they said supported their own observations The IPCC says that climate change is real and happening much more strongly than before We are already seeing the effects of climate change in Bangladesh and across south Asia Its not news to us Most developing countries are facing climate change now They do not need the IPCC to tell them that the weather is changing said Saleemul Huq director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development Scientists have also lowered their projections of sealevel rises Depending on future greenhouse gas emissions sea levels will rise an average of 4062 cm by 2100 Nevertheless there will be signifi cant geographical variations many millions of people living in the developing worlds great cities including Lagos and Calcutta are threatened Weather disasters are also more likely in a warmer world the report suggests Although the global frequency of tropical cyclones is expected to decrease or remain unchanged they may become more intense with stronger winds and heavier rainfall Life in many developingcountry cities could become unbearable especially as urban temperatures are already far above those in surrounding countryside Much higher temperatures could reduce the length of the growing period in some parts of Africa by up to 20 the report said The charity Oxfam predicted that world hunger would worsen because climate changes inevitably hurt crop production and reduce incomes They said the number of people at risk of hunger might rise by 10 to 20 by 2050 The changing climate is already

44,When Pope Benedict XVI was elected in 2005 he said he was a simple humble worker in Gods vineyard And on a grey cold windy Monday in February he resigned in the same way like an old workman with pains in his back and no more strength in his arms The first German Pope in modern times gave an exact departure time From 28 February 2013 at 2000 hours he told a gathering of cardinals in the Vatican the see of Rome the see of Saint Peter will be vacant and there will be an election for a new Pope One of the cardinals at the gathering was a Mexican cardinal Monsignor Oscar Sanchz Barba from Guadalajara He was in Rome for an official meeting We were all in the Apostolic Palace he said The Pope took a sheet of paper and read from it We were all Sanchz Barba couldnt find the word The cardinals had just heard the man they believe is Gods representative on earth resign The cardinals were just looking at one another Sanchz Barba said Angelo Sodano the Dean of the College of Cardinals who probably already knew about the Popes decision gave a short speech He told the Pope that the cardinals would be loyal to him and added that he and the others present had listened to the Popes words with a feeling of confusion At the end of his speech the pope blessed the cardinals and left It was so simple the simplest thing you can imagine said Sanchz Barba Then we all left in silence There was absolute silence and sadness John Thavis spent 30 years reporting on the Vatican and has a book The Vatican Diaries that will be published soon He said he had a feeling before that the Pope was going to resign Thavis said that in the long interview Benedict gave to a German journalist in 2010 he had said he would resign if he felt he could no longer do the job I asked myself if I were Pope and wanted to resign when would I choose He has completed his series of books and most of his projects Also there were no dates in his calendar of events he had to attend I thought the most likely date was 22 February but I got it wrong Soon after the announcement the Vatican was saying that the Popes decision was brave Thavis agreed What I find particularly courageous is that he is going now when he is not sick and that hes leaving because hes tired and not because hes ill But is that the whole story Does the Pope know more about his state of health than the Vatican has so far made public Benedict said that he is resigning not just for physical reasons but also for psychological reasons He said that the position of Pope needed both strength of mind and strength of body and in the last few months he felt that he was slowly losing that strength There will no doubt be other theories in future days and weeks just as there were following the death of Pope John Paul I in 1978 33 days after his election Already people are saying that there was a secret in Benedicts past and that somebody was going to tell everyone The Vatican will no doubt say those stories are nonsense But we can understand why some people think there might be a secret because Benedicts decision is so historic At St Peters Basilica Julia Rochester from London still didnt know what the Popes resignation meant If youre Gods chosen person how do you choose not be chosen she asked It is a question many Catholics will be asking their priests in future weeks,Pope Benedict XVI arrived in 2005 as a simple humble worker in Gods vineyard And on a grey cold windy Monday in February he resigned in the same way like an elderly labourer who can no longer ignore the pains in his back who can no longer rely on the strength of his arms A traditional Pope he made his excuses in Latin The first German Pope in modern times gave an exact departure time From 28 February 2013 at 2000 hours he told a group of cardinals in the Vatican the see of Rome the see of Saint Peter will be vacant and a new pope will have to be elected Among those present was a Mexican cardinal Monsignor Oscar Sanchz Barba from Guadalajara He was in Rome for an official meeting We were all in the Sala del Concistoro of the Apostolic Palace he said The pope took a sheet of paper and read from it We were all left Sanchz Barba looked around him in St Peters Square looking for the word he was as speechless as the princes of the church who had just heard the man they believe to be Gods representative on earth give up the job The cardinals were just looking at one another Sanchz Barba said Angelo Sodano the Dean of the College of Cardinals who must have known beforehand gave a brief speech Before going on to assure the Pope of the cardinals loyalty and devotion he said he and the others present had listened to you with a sense of confusion almost completely incredulous At the end of his speech the Pope blessed the people present and left It was so simple the simplest thing imaginable said Sanchz Barba Then we all left in silence There was absolute silence and sadness John Thavis who spent 30 years reporting on the Vatican and whose book The Vatican Diaries is soon to be published said he had had a feeling the Pope might be about to resign and timed his return to Rome from the US accordingly Thavis noted that in the long interview Benedict gave to a German journalist in 2010 he had made it clear he considered it would be right to go if he felt he could no longer do the job I asked myself if I were Pope and wanted to resign when would I choose He has completed his series of books and most of his projects What is more there were no dates in his calendar of events he personally had to attend I thought the most likely date was 22 February but I got it wrong Within hours of the announcement Vatican officials were saying that the Popes decision was a brave one Thavis agreed What I find particularly courageous is that he is prepared to say now when he is not sick that he is going and that hes doing it because hes tired and not because hes particularly ill But is that the whole story Does he know more about his state of health than the Vatican has so far made public Benedicts own reasons make it clear that he took into account not only his physical but also his psychological condition He said that the position of pope required both strength of mind and strength of body and in the last few months he felt that strength was gradually decreasing There will no doubt be other theories in the days and weeks ahead just as there were following the death of Pope John Paul I in 1978 33 days after his election Already there is speculation that some information was about to come out about Benedicts past The Vatican will no doubt dismiss any such stories But they are understandable for the transcendental importance of what Benedict has done cannot be overstated Coming out of St Peters Basilica Julia Rochester from London who described herself as a lapsed Catholic was still considering the implications of the Popes resignation If youre Gods chosen one how do you choose not be chosen she asked It is a question many Catholics will be asking their priests in the weeks ahead,train,ELE,INT

selling their stately home At Downton Abbey Lord Grantham wants to reduce the number of servants The real Downton Abbey is Highclere Castle a stately home owned by George Herbert 8th Earl of Carnarvon At Highclere Castle they have more money than before Lady Fiona Carnarvon says that the huge success of Downton all around the world has paid for building repairs at the castle Its been an amazing magic carpet ride for all of us she said Im very grateful My husband and I love Highclere Castle Now millions of other people love it At the moment they only use the ground floor and first floor of Highclere on the borders of Hampshire But a restoration project of tower rooms has begun When it is finished visitors will be able to climb up into the tower to an exhibition of the work of the architect of the Houses of Parliament Sir Charles Barry who also rebuilt Highclere Castle between 1839 and 1842 In 2009 when the Downton Abbey producers first asked about filming at Highclere Castle the castle needed 12 million of repairs It was just after the banking crisis and we were worried Then Downton began and Highclere became a major tourist attraction The number of visitors doubled to 1200 a day after Downton Abbey written by Julian Fellowes was shown around the world It was a hit in the UK in 2010 and then in the US It is now shown on television in 250 countries The Downton tourists are part of a growing phenomenon The organization VisitBritain says that nearly 30 of foreign visitors nearly nine million people visit castles and historic houses Almost half of visitors to Britain now say they want to visit places from films or TV More than a million tourists take a tour of historic buildings each year and they spend more than 1 billion Fiftyone per cent of Brazilians 42 of Russians and Chinese and 35 of Indian visitors will probably include a visit to a site of interest in their trips VisitBritains director Patricia Yates said The links between tourism films and

particular time in history Its the first TV period drama that everyone knows and talks about Lady Carnarvon says that the longterm future of Highclere might not be secure But she says The programme has allowed us to spend faster on the buildings Highclere Castle plans a Tutankhamun event in 2022 100 years after the 5th Earl of Carnarvon went to Egypt with Howard Carter and discovered Tutankhamuns tomb Another event is the 300th anniversary of the birth of Lancelot Capability Brown who designed the grounds Every single day dont take anything for granted said Lady Carnarvon You have to invest in these great houses Ive tried to show people it is fun We have special events not just a walk around a dusty house,The atmosphere at the beginning of the final series of Downton Abbey is one of melancholy and changing times The year is 1925 The neighbours are selling up their own stately home while Lord Grantham wants to cut back on servants But at the real Downton Abbey Highclere Castle a stately home owned by George Geordie Herbert 8th Earl of Carnarvon they have more money than before According to Lady Fiona Carnarvon the huge global success of Downton has paid for building repairs that are needed to save Highclere for the next generation Its been an amazing magic carpet ride for all of us she said Its given us free marketing and an international profile Im hugely grateful My husband and I love Highclere Castle Now it is loved by millions of other people Currently only the ground and first floors of Highclere on the borders of Hampshire are used But a restoration project of tower rooms has begun that will eventually allow visitors to climb up into the tower to an exhibition showing the work of the architect of the Houses of Parliament Sir Charles Barry who rebuilt the house between 1839 and 1842 When the Downton Abbey producers first approached Highclere in 2009 the family had 12 million of repairs to do 18 million of that work was urgent But by 2012 Downton Abbey was having a positive effect Lord Carnarvon said then It was just after the banking crisis and we were worried Then Downton began and Highclere became a major tourist attraction Visitor numbers doubled to 1200 a day as Downton Abbey written by Julian Fellowes was shown around the world after becoming a hit in the UK in 2010 and then in the US It is now broadcast in 250 countries There is now a computerized advance booking system which helps foreign visitors to buy tickets Highcleres current assets have almost trebled to around 1 million since 2012 Gareth Neame the executive producer for the series said I think Downton Abbey secured Highcleres future Peter Fincham ITVs director of television remembers the moment when Highclere was booked I thought So what because I had never heard of Highclere Castle I thought Every stately home looks the same But I was wrong The castle has been an enormous character as well The Downton tourists are part of a growing phenomenon VisitBritain estimates that nearly 30 of foreign visitors or nearly nine million people visit castles and historic houses Almost half of visitors to Britain now say they want to visit places from films or TV More than a million take a tour of historic buildings each year spending more than 1 billion Fiftyone per cent of Brazilians 42 of Russians and Chinese and 35 of Indian visitors are likely to include a visit to a site of interest in their trips VisitBritains director Patricia Yates said The links between tourism films and TV are strong She added that period dramas have also increased the popularity of places outside of London Downton Abbey expresses a certain view of Britain It is a fantasy world based in a particular time in history Its the first TV period drama that has really become part of popular culture Lady Carnarvon says that the longterm future of Highclere is not necessarily secure But she says The programme has allowed us to spend faster on the buildings Highclere Castle plans a Tutankhamun event in 2022 100 years after the 5th Earl of Carnarvon discovered Tutankhamuns tomb with Howard Carter Another opportunity to keep Highclere in the public mind is the 300th anniversary of the birth of Lancelot Capability Brown who designed the grounds Every single day dont take anything for granted said Lady Carnarvon You have to invest in all these great houses And there has been a deficit since the 1930s In the past an estate and house supported the family and their lifestyle but today it is quite the reverse the challenge is how Geordie and I can support Highclere Ive tried to persuade people it is fun We have specific events they can engage with not just a walk around a dusty house We have to compete with attractions like the London Dungeon,train,ELE,INT
167,Moses King 48 is HIV positive HIV is common in Liberia King gets medicine for the disease from the Liberian government But King and his family of six children cannot get the right food to eat A poor farmer he grew vegetables and bought rice But he could not afford meat and fish expensive luxury products in Liberian markets but essential sources of protein Pate K Chon who works with HIV sufferers in Liberia has found a solution She watched a film about a fish farm in Thailand several years ago and had the idea of starting a similar project in Liberia so that HIV sufferers could have work and also get a source of protein I saw this film about fish in a cement pool and I thought it was a good idea said Chon who is also HIV positive So many of the people I work with dont have the money to have a balanced protein diet and fish is such a clean source of protein it doesnt cause health problems like other sources and it is something we can farm Chon began building a pool in which to farm fish In June 2012 she met John Sheehy He raised money for the nonprofit fish farm in the northeast of Monrovia Liberias capital and started learning about fish farming doing an online course and speaking to other fish farmers in Africa I raised the money and built the farm learned how to build the tanks and water flow system said Sheehy I learnt a lot on my own and now I would love to be able to write a book and share my knowledge with other people he said The project is now a fish farm with 12 tanks each with 5000 fish and will give up to 200000 fish per year to a community of 1200 mainly HIVpositive people including King and his family In addition to the fish waste from the tanks is collected and used to water crops also giving food and money to the community Many people in the community work on the farm said Sheehy and what they get in return is fish They can use those fish to feed themselves and to sell in the market so that they get money to buy other food The fish farm gives these people with HIV a way of getting back into society now they are buying and selling with people in the market every week 15 of Liberias 35 million people are HIV positive Good nutrition is particularly important for people with HIV They need much more protein to stop their health getting worse and to allow healthy growth Nutrition is one of the key things if you are taking drugs to treat HIV said Chon The drugs are toxic and if you dont have food to eat they can make you very ill But food in Liberia is very expensive We buy expensive rice from other countries and fish is difficult for most people to afford Fish farming is absolutely possible in Africa said Paul White owner of a fish farm in Ivory Coast which produces 3000 tonnes of fish each year But some people criticize farmed fish they say the fish can be inbred and have high levels of toxins Sheehy says they do not have those problems A lot of farmed fish is inbred which causes problems but we are using a process with local fish from Liberia not fish from another region And we test the water and watch it all the time Sheehy hopes to open more fish farms throughout Liberia and the region A ricegrowing cooperative in Sierra Leone asked us if we could do this on our property so that they can feed their workers and we have had interest from Nigeria and Central America said Sheehy,Ever since he was diagnosed HIV positive Moses King 48 has had one major problem He has been able to cope with the stigma of being HIV positive widespread in Liberia and he was able to access antiretroviral medication distributed by the Liberian government But King and his family of six children could not get the right food to eat A subsistence farmer he grew vegetables and bought rice But he could not afford meat and fish expensive luxury products in Liberian markets but essential sources of protein Pate K Chon a counsellor who works with HIV sufferers in Liberia provided a surprising solution Since watching a documentary about a fish farm in Thailand several years earlier she had thought of setting up a similar project in Liberia allowing HIV sufferers to have work and also access a stable source of protein I saw this film about fish in a cement pool and I thought it was a good idea said Chon herself diagnosed with HIV in 1992 So many of the people I work with dont have the money to have a balanced protein diet and fish is such a clean source of protein it doesnt cause health problems like other sources and it is something we can farm Chon began building a pool in which to farm fish In June 2012 Chon met John Sheehy a philanthropist Sheehy raised money for the nonprofit fish farm in the northeast of Monrovia Liberias capital and set about learning about fish farming doing an online course through Cornell University and speaking to other fish farmers in Africa I raised the money and built the farm learned the proper tank layout and water flow system said Sheehy A lot of my knowledge was selftaught and now I would love to be able to write a manual and share it with other people he added The project has now grown into the Grow2Feed Liberia Fish Farm with 12 tanks which when full will each have 5000 fish providing up to 200000 fish per year serving a community of 1200 mainly HIVpositive people including King and his family In addition to the fish waste from the tanks is collected and used to irrigate crops also providing food and money for the community The members of the community live near the farm and have agreed to be part of the cooperative said Sheehy Many work on the farm and what they get in return is fish They can use those fish to feed themselves and to sell in the market so that they get money to buy other essential items The fish farm gives these people with HIV a way of getting back into society now they are trading with people in the market every week According to Liberias health survey15 of Liberias 35 million people are HIV positive with 60 of those women or girls Stigma and discrimination still surround the illness and around half of all people with HIV in the country are untreated Good nutrition is particularly important for people with HIV Research has shown they need much higher levels of protein to stop their health deteriorating and to allow healthy growth Nutrition is one of the key things if you are taking antiretroviral drugs said Chon The drugs are toxic and if you dont have food to eat they can make you very ill But food in Liberia is very expensive We buy expensive imported rice even though we should be growing it ourselves and fish is difficult for most people to afford Fish farming is absolutely possible in Africa said Paul White owner of the HydroFish fish farm in Ivory Coast which produces 3000 tonnes of fish each year A lot of the fish on the market comes from China and is imported frozen It is of a quality that could never enter Europe or America He said there had been a lack of investment in fish production but that things were changing now Some critics are sceptical of farmed fish saying fish can be inbred and have high levels of toxins But Sheehy said good practice can reduce these problems A lot of farmed fish is inbred which does cause problems but we are using a process with local fish from Liberia not fish from another region said Sheehy And we are not using lakes that are cornered off where the fish absorb all the toxins in the lake We can control the environment using the tanks and we test the water and monitor it constantly Sheehy hopes to open more fish farms throughout Liberia and the region A ricegrowing coop in Sierra Leone asked us if we could do this on our property so that they can feed their workers and we have had interest from Nigeria and Central America

experimental performances of the plays There will also be hundreds of lectures international conferences lms concerts operas and major exhibitions Shakespeare was famous in his own lifetime but there

Bank and details of payments for performances for James I and Queen Anne The director of the Globe Theatre recently said as a joke that Shakespeare was a true London man But people in Stratford believe that the town made and educated Shakespeare They are rebuilding his old school room and will open it as a visitor attraction Shakespeare bought New Place the second best house in the town where he died in 1616 on 23 April the same day as his birth You dont buy a house like New Place and not live there Paul Edmondson said The general public and many academics have underestimated the importance of Stratford to Shakespeare Edmondson believes that after Shakespeare bought the house in 1597 all his thinking time was spent there He says the late plays were planned in his library and probably written there Shakespeares house was demolished 300 years ago Another house was built in the same place That house was destroyed in 1759 by a bad tempered priest Francis Gastrell in an argument about taxes He also cut down Shakespeares mulberry tree under which the writer sat and worked because he didnt like all the tourists looking into his garden The house has never been rebuilt but they have found Shakespeares kitchen in the cellars The area where the house was will be on display for the anniversary with the foundations marked and the garden restored Without Stratford

born in the Warwickshire market town in 1564 who died there 400 years ago Stratford remained hugely important during Shakespeares life says Paul Edmondson the head of learning and research at the

move when Shakespeare and his fellow actors dismantled a theatre on the north side of the Thames and rebuilt it as the Globe on the South Bank and accounts showing payments from the royal treasury for Boxing Day performances for James I and Queen Anne The director of the Globe Dominic Dromgoole recently jokily claimed Shakespeare was a true Londoner Stratford however will be insisting that the town made and educated Shakespeare They are restoring his old school room It will open as a permanent visitor attraction Shakespeare bought the splendid New Place the second best house in the town where he died according to literary legend on St Georges Day 23 April the same day as his birth You dont buy a house like New Place and not live there Paul Edmondson said The general public and many academics have consistently underestimated the importance of Stratford to Shakespeare Edmondson believes that after Shakespeare bought the house in 1597 all his thinking time was spent there and that the late plays including The Tempest were at least planned in his library and probably written there The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust describes New Place as the jewel in the crown of the 400th anniversary celebrations However Shakespeares house was demolished 300 years ago and the house that replaced it was demolished in 1759 by a badtempered priest Francis Gastrell in an argument over taxes He had already cut down Shakespeares mulberry tree under which the writer is said to have sat and worked because he was irritated by all the tourists peering into his garden The gap where the house was has

biggest fights ever between the White House and Congress during Obamas presidency Obama easily beat his Republican opponent Mitt Romney Obama kept lots of swing states but the election showed again how divided America is Obama disappointed many of his supporters in his first four years so now he wants to become a great President He wants to work on many issues for example continued economic recovery immigration education climate change Iran and IsraelPalestine Boehner talked about the need for both parties to find common ground and take steps together to help our economy grow and create jobs which is critical to solving our debt Reid said I look at the challenges that we have ahead of us and I reach out to my Republican colleagues in the Senate and the House Lets come together We know what the issues are lets solve them The trouble will come when talks move to detail The Republicans want to keep military spending the same but the Democrats want to reduce military spending

resolve the economic crisis But it could become one of the biggest battles yet between the White House and Congress under Obamas presidency While Obama easily beat his Republican opponent Mitt Romney holding swing state after swing state the election showed again how divided America remains While the inauguration is not until January in effect Obama started his second term on Wednesday Having disappointed many supporters in his first term he now wants to establish a legacy that will transform him from a middling president into a great one As well as overseeing what he hopes will be continued economic recovery he hopes to address issues from immigration reform to investment in education and climate change and in foreign policy from Iran to IsraelPalestine He comfortably won more than the required 270 electoral college votes and he also won a higher share of the popular vote Boehner in a statement sounded conciliatory He talked about the need for both parties to find common ground and take steps together to help our economy grow and create jobs which is critical to solving our debt Reid also sounded conciliatory saying I look at the challenges that we have ahead of us and I reach out to my Republican colleagues in the Senate and the House Lets come together We know what the issues are lets solve them The trouble will come when talks move to detail the Republicans want to protect military spending while the Democrats want cuts Obama wants tax increases on households earning more than 250000 Boehner has rejected any tax increases In the presidential race Romney won only one of the swing states North Carolina while Obama held New Hampshire Virginia Ohio Wisconsin Nevada Iowa and Colorado In his victory speech in Chicago Obama referred to the long queues to vote and said there was a need for electoral reform He returned to the soaring rhetoric that was his trademark during the 2008 election but which was not seen in 2012 because his campaign team decided it was inappropriate But now that he has won he returned to famous lines from earlier speeches such as his 2008 slogan about hope Obama told the ecstatic crowd of supporters Tonight in this election you the American people reminded us that while our road has been hard while our journey has been long we have picked ourselves up we have fought our way back And we know in our hearts that for the United States of America the best is yet to come In a speech that lasted more than 25 minutes Obama paid emotional tribute to his wife Michelle and his daughters Malia and Sasha as well as to his VicePresident Joe Biden Then he returned to the message that first brought him to national attention We are not as divided as our politics suggests he said We are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states We are and forever will be the United States of America Obama made clear he had an agenda in mind for his second term He mentioned changes in the tax code immigration reform and as he put it an America that isnt threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet Just before Romney had phoned the President to concede He said This is a time for great challenges for America and I pray the President will be successful in guiding our nation The campaign almost throughout has been a referendum on Obama Despite the slow economy recovery and a high unemployment level Americans decided not to change presidents Historically it would have been a disappointment for African Americans and many white liberals if the first black presidency had ended in failure,train,ELE,INT
159,There is a time in some mens lives when the days seem darker death is more certain and the only thing they want to do is spend all their money on a sportscar Radical changes in lifestyle are normal for the midlife crisis If the midlife crisis is real then humans may not be the only animals to get it Now an international team of scientists say they have found evidence that chimpanzees and orangutans are less happy in their middle years This they say is the ape equivalent of the midlife crisis The study says that the midlife crisis may come from the biology humans share with apes Alex Weiss a psychologist at Edinburgh University told the Guardian that most people agree that our level of wellbeing reduces in middle age He said that in the study they asked if its possible that the midlife crisis is not just something human The team from the US Japan Germany and the UK asked zookeepers and others who worked with male and female apes of various ages to complete questionnaires on the animals The questionnaires included questions about each apes mood the enjoyment they got from being with other apes and people and their success in doing things The final question asked if the keepers would like to be the ape for one week More than 500 apes were included in the study in three separate groups The first two groups were chimpanzees and the third were orangutans from Sumatra or Borneo The animals came from zoos sanctuaries and research centres in the US Australia Japan Canada and Singapore When the researchers analyzed the questionnaires they found that wellbeing in the apes decreased in middle age and increased again as the animals became old In captivity great apes often live to 50 or more The animals felt the most unhappy on average at 283 and 272 years old for the chimpanzees and 354 years old for the orangutans In all three groups we find that chimpanzees and orangutans are most unhappy at an age that is roughly equal to midlife in humans Weiss said Robin Dunbar Professor of Evolutionary Psychology at Oxford University was sceptical about the study Its hard to see anything in an apes life that would give a sense of wellbeing over such a long time Alexandra Freund Professor of Psychology at the University of Zurich was also sceptical She said In my opinion there is no evidence for the midlife crisis But Weiss believes the study could give us a deeper understanding of the emotional crisis some men may experience If we want to find whats going on with the midlife crisis we should look at what is similar in middleaged humans chimps and orangutans he said,There comes a time in some mens lives when the days seem darker death more certain and the only sensible response is to blow the life savings on a sportscar Radical and often illadvised changes in lifestyle are typical for the midlife crisis but if it is more than a myth then humans may not be the only animals to experience it Now an international team of scientists claims it has found evidence for a slump in wellbeing among middleaged chimpanzees and orangutans The lull in happiness in the middle years they say is the ape equivalent of the midlife crisis The findings of the study which was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggest that the midlife crisis may have its roots in the biology humans share with our closest evolutionary cousins Theres a common understanding that theres a dip in wellbeing in middle age Alex Weiss a psychologist at Edinburgh University told the Guardian He said that they took a step back and asked whether its possible that the midlife crisis is not just something human The team from the US Japan Germany and the UK asked zookeepers and others who worked with male and female apes of various ages to complete questionnaires on the animals The forms included questions about each apes mood the enjoyment they got from socializing and their success at achieving certain goals The final question asked how zookeepers would feel about being the ape for a week They scored their answers from one to seven More than 500 apes were included in the study in three separate groups The first two groups were chimpanzees with the third made up of orangutans from Sumatra or Borneo The animals came from zoos sanctuaries and research centres in the US Australia Japan Canada and Singapore When the researchers analyzed the questionnaires they found that wellbeing in the apes fell in middle age and climbed again as the animals moved into old age In captivity great apes often live to 50 or more The animals wellbeing was at its lowest on average at 283 and 272 years old for the chimpanzees and 354 years old for the orangutans In all three groups we find evidence that wellbeing is lowest in chimpanzees and orangutans at an age that corresponds more or less to midlife in humans Weiss said On average wellbeing scores are lowest when animals are around 30 years old Robin Dunbar Professor of Evolutionary Psychology at Oxford University was sceptical about the findings What can produce a sense of wellbeing that varies across their lifetimes like this Its hard to see anything in an apes life that would have that sort of pattern Theyre not particularly good at seeing far ahead into the future thats one of the big differences between them and us Alexandra Freund Professor of Psychology at the University of Zurich was also sceptical She said In my opinion there is no evidence for the midlife crisis But Weiss believes the findings could point to a deeper understanding of the emotional crisis some men may experience If we want to find the answer to the question of whats going on with the midlife crisis we should look at what is similar in middleaged humans chimps and orangutans he

Brasilia Belem Belo Horizonte and Salvador started peacefully but there were some clashes with police and people set fire to cars and buses People complained that police used rubber bullets tear gas and violent beatings Happening at the start of the football Confederations Cup the rallies brought together people who are angry with the high costs and poor quality of public services the large amounts of money spent on international sporting events low standards of health care inequality and corruption Most of the demonstrations were peaceful but several police were hurt at least one car was burned and windows were broken People were demonstrating for different reasons We are here because we hate the government They do nothing for us said Oscar Jos Santos 19 years old Im an architect but I have been unemployed for six months There must be something wrong with this country said Nadia al Husin At a smaller rally in Brasilia demonstrators entered the highsecurity area of the national

In Porto Alegre demonstrators set fire to a bus and in Curitiba protesters tried to enter the office of the state governor There were also rallies in Belem Salvador and other places In So Paulo there were large groups of people but the marches were peaceful Most protesters were young and for many it was their first experience of such a giant rally My generation has never experienced this said Thiago Firbida a student Since the dictatorship Brazilians have never demonstrated like this They did not believe they had a reason to But now Brazil once again has problems with a constant rise in prices so people are finally reacting Brazils demonstrations have been given special names the vinegar revolution because police arrested people for carrying vinegar to stop the effects of tear gas the 20cent revolution because of the bus price rise and the Passe Livre because of the demand for free public transport Some said the protests did not feel Brazilian but they were liberating Our politicians need to see the strength we have as one people Brazilians are usually too nice they enjoy partying not protesting but something is changing said Deli Borsari a 53yearold yoga teacher After people heard about the costs of new and improved stadiums on the news the Confederations Cup football tournament has been one of the reasons for the protests Before Saturdays match in Brasilia groups of demonstrators were dispersed by riot police Frightened Japanese supporters ran from the area holding their children when they heard shots perhaps rubber bullets or tear gas Another protest march

have an election,Brazil experienced one of its biggest nights of protest in decades as more than 100000 people took to the streets to express their frustration at aggressive policing poor public services and high costs for the World Cup The major demonstrations in Rio de Janeiro So Paulo Brasilia Belem Belo Horizonte Salvador and elsewhere started peacefully but several led to clashes with police and arson attacks on cars and buses People complained during previous smaller protests against bus price increases that police responded disproportionately with rubber bullets tear gas and violent beatings The rallies came at the same time as the start of the football Confederations Cup The rallies brought together people who are frustrated with the rising costs and poor quality of public services large amounts of money being spent on international sporting events low standards of health care and wider unease about inequality and corruption The vast majority of demonstrations were peaceful but several police were injured at least one car was overturned and burned and windows were smashed The unrest increased during the night as a large crowd set several fires outside a government office smashed the buildings windows and painted graffiti on the walls that said Revolution Down with Paes down with Cabral the mayor and state governor and Hate police Police inside

16,Wales will become the first country in the UK that will assume that people agree to donate their organs if they havent opted out The Welsh Assembly voted to accept the optout scheme which will allow hospitals to assume that people who die want to donate if they have not registered an objection This is a very big day for Wales and most importantly for the 226 people in Wales who are waiting for an organ transplant said the Welsh Health Minister Mark Drakeford I am proud that Wales will be the first nation in the UK to take this step We have shown we are ready to take action to increase organ donation and to give hope to those people who wait every week for a transplant When family members know that organ donation is what the dead person wanted they usually agree to the donation The new law will make clearer peoples wishes about organ donation and so it will increase the number of donations The issue is controversial but the government says they will protect the dead persons and the familys wishes Relatives will have a clear right of objection which will give them the chance to show that their relative did not want to be an organ donor Wales has acted because it does not have enough organs for people who need them said Drakeford About one person every week dies in Wales while on a waiting list About a third of the people who live in Wales are on the organ donor register but more than twothirds of people say they are happy to be organ donors That other third is people who dont find the time to put their names on the register The new law would apply to anybody over 18 who has lived in Wales for at least the year before his or her death Donated organs would not only go to people in need of a transplant in Wales but to anybody in the UK Doctors are delighted at the scheme Big efforts have been made in recent years to increase the number of those who carry an organ donation card with a lot of success Hospitals have also become better at organizing transplants for example they have important discussions with relatives when no one knows what the wishes of the dead person were But the increase in numbers of organs is still not enough Some religious groups strongly oppose the scheme Members of the Muslim Council of Wales and the South Wales Jewish Representative Council are not happy while the Archbishop of Wales Barry Morgan said that donation ought to be a gift of love of generosity If organs can be taken unless someone has explicitly registered an objection thats not an expression of love Its more a medical use of a body,Wales will become the first country in the UK that will presume people have consented to donate their organs unless they opt out The Welsh Assembly has voted to adopt the optout policy which will allow hospitals to act on the assumption that people who die want to donate unless they have specifically registered an objection The policy was passed by 43 votes to eight with two abstentions in spite of objections from religious groups for moral reasons and worries that the scheme could add to the unhappiness of grieving families This is a huge day for Wales and most importantly for the 226 people in Wales waiting for an organ transplant said the Welsh Health Minister Mark Drakeford I am proud that Wales will be the first nation in the UK to take this step As a society we have shown we are prepared to take action to increase organ donation and to provide hope to those people waiting every week for a transplant Family refusal is a major factor that affects the numbers of organ donations and the main reason for refusal is lack of knowledge of their loved ones wishes The aim of the scheme has always been to respect the wishes of the deceased however relatives or friends may object to consent When family members know that organ donation is what the deceased wanted they usually agree to the donation The new law will work by making clearer peoples wishes around the issue of organ donation and it will increase the rate of consent to donation The issue is controversial opponents are worried that the urgent need for more kidneys and hearts will lead to hospitals overruling the wishes of those who have died and their family But the government insists their wishes will be protected Relatives will have a clear right of objection giving them the chance to show that the deceased would not have wanted to be an organ donor Wales has acted because of an acute shortage of organs We have the problem of not having enough organs for people who need them said Drakeford About one person every week dies in Wales while on a waiting list Around a third of the Welsh population is on the organ donor register but well over twothirds in surveys say they are happy to be organ donors That other third is people who dont find the time to put their names on the register The new law would apply to anybody over 18 who has lived in Wales for at least the year before his or her death Donated organs would not only go to people in need of a transplant in Wales but to anybody in the UK Doctors are delighted at the new policy The British Medical Association has campaigned for a long time for an optout system because it is worried about the growing number of people who need transplants Big efforts have been made in recent years to increase the number of those who carry an organ donation card with a good deal of success Hospitals have also introduced improved systems for coordinating transplants including the important discussions with relatives when no one really knows what the wishes of the deceased were But the increase in numbers of organs that are donated is still not enough Some religious groups on the other hand strongly disagree with the new law they argue that it would cause further unhappiness to relatives Members of the Muslim Council of Wales and the South Wales Jewish Representative Council have expressed worries while the Archbishop of Wales Barry Morgan said that donation ought to be a gift of love of generosity If organs can be taken unless someone has explicitly registered an objection thats not an expression of love Its more a medical use of a

1,One day drones could deliver packages to your home When will this happen If you believe Amazon it will be soon Other people are not so sure They have to invent the right technology but also they have to consider public safety Amazon say that they will be ready as soon as the Federal Aviation Authority FAA introduce rules for using drones The FAA will nally introduce rules for using unmanned aircraft by June 2016 But the technology has a long way to go before then and larger machines arent legal yet only drones up to 25kg will be legal And the FAA says in the rules they want to introduce that drones will all have to use different radio frequencies that nobody can block or hijack Professor Sajiv Singh who works for delivery company NearEarth said that ying drones is quite simple you just give it some basic instructions go to this height do this short task go back home But even short ights from a mobile landing place could cause serious problems he said Theyre not planning to deliver in areas where nobody lives theyre planning to deliver from a warehouse to the consumer which will probably be in a town or city he said The drone will have to see hazards Maybe there will be things that the map doesnt know about Maybe there will be construction equipment that wasnt there but is there now Maybe GPS signals will be blocked so its going to have an incorrect idea about where it is All this can be solved he said but its dif cult One big problem is keeping radio contact with a drone and planning for what happens if that contact breaks If a drone loses radio contact it will keep going and crash into the ground said robot expert Daniel Huber We already have most of the technology we need said Huber He is working on a program that will use drones to check telephone lines bridges and so on We can make drones y around a certain area and look at every surface Huber said about Amazon They say that many packages are light a drone can carry a kilogram for 15 minutes If you have a vehicle that can go into a neighbourhood it can deliver from that vehicle You need a 15minute distance and typical drones have about that distance Its one way he said to make sure people are safe The larger the distance the more dangerous it becomes Of course safety is still a big worry Singh points out that for a passenger aeroplane to be allowed to y it can only have one serious failure every one million hours Drones he said are much less safe The Reaper drone for example has one failure in 10000 hours Singh said Part of the reason for this is simply that air travel is dangerous so standards are much higher If you y a passenger aeroplane often they will say Oh a small part isnt working we have to go back Singh said And people have been ying passanger aeroplanes for 60 years I hate to think that a drone might come down on a busy road Part of the solution Singh said is planning for every situation If things fail the drone has to do something sensible,Will we soon live in a world where drones deliver packages If you believe Amazon the answer is yes Others are not so sure we need to make more technical progress in this area but there is also the problem of public safety Amazon spokesman Paul Misener told a US congress hearing recently that his company would be ready as soon as all the rules were in place The Federal Aviation Authority FAA will nally have regulations on the commercial use of unmanned aircraft by June 2016 But the technology has a long way to go before then and larger machines arent legal yet only drones up to 25kg will be legal And the FAA says that if youre going to crowd the skies with radio controlled ying robots they must all use different radio frequencies that nobody can jam or hijack Professor Sajiv Singh who runs a cargo delivery company called NearEarth said that to pilot a stateoftheart drone you simply give it some basic instructions go to this altitude perform this short task go back home But even short ights from a mobile landing pad could cause serious logistical problems he said Theyre not going to deliver from one uninhabited place to another uninhabited place theyre going to deliver from a warehouse to the consumer which will probably be an urban area or a suburban area he said In those particular cases there are going to be hazards that the vehicle is going to have to see Maybe there will be terrain that the map doesnt know about Then maybe theres construction equipment that wasnt there before but is there now Maybe GPS signals are blocked in which case its going to have an incorrect idea about where it is All these problems can be solved he said but its dif cult One major problem is maintaining radio contact with a drone and planning for what happens if that contact breaks If you have an offtheshelf UAV unmanned aerial vehicle itll just keep going and crash into the ground said roboticist Daniel Huber Furthermore you cant do everything with a 25kg aircraft said Jay McConville director of business development for unmanned systems at Lockheed Martin People in the aircraft business have to remind ourselves that the operator doesnt really care about every little thing about the aircraft and wants instead to focus on the end result he said Operators want to see vehicle status information they want to see video on their handheld device or their laptop Technologically most of the things that we need for this are in place said Huber He is working on a program to allow drones to inspect infrastructure pipelines telephone lines bridges and so on Weve developed an exploration algorithm where you draw a box around an area and it will y around that area and look at every surface and then report back Huber who works on 3D systems imagery said about Amazon I have heard them say that many packages are lightweight a drone can carry a kilogram for 15 minutes If you have a vehicle that can go into a neighbourhood it can deliver from that base You need a 15minute distance and typical offtheshelf drones have that distance Its one way he said of making sure the surrounding population is relatively safe The larger you get the more dangerous you get Problems with the use of drones can be solved in some very dramatic ways Huber said At a recent conference he said a disaster relief drone company demonstrated a robot that could take off and when it got tired land on its own charging station and exchange its batteries Of course safety is still a major concern Singh says that for a commercial aircraft to be allowed to y it has to prove a rate of one serious failure every one million hours Drones he said are a long way from that The Reaper drone has one failure in 10000 hours Singh said But they dont consider an oil leak a catastrophic failure something has to fall out of the sky Part of the reason for this is that air travel is dangerous so standards are much higher If you y commercial airlines they often say Oh a component has failed we have to go back to the gate Singh said And thats an established industry with 60 years of legacy I hate to think that a drone might come down on a busy road Part of the solution Singh said is planning for every situation If things fail the

71,The US Senate Intelligence Committee recently agreed a bill to allow the National Security Agency NSA to continue to collect US phone records But it would also make the NSAs activities more transparent The committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein introduced the bill It allows the NSA to continue to collect the telephone metadata of millions of Americans It also allows the government to keep the data Eleven people voted for the bill and four people voted against it The full Senate will now vote on the bill The bill allows analysts to search through the data if they believe that someone may be involved in international terrorism The bill also allows the NSA to continue to watch foreigners who come to the US if they enter the country for less than 72 hours Senator Patrick Leahy introduced another bill the USA Freedom Act This bill would stop the collection of phone records in the US Feinstein defended the NSA phone data collection programme but said that people didnt trust the NSA anymore The NSA programme is legal and I believe it makes us safer she said But we can and should do more to increase transparency and build public support for privacy protections Feinstein said the bill would also make a number of improvements to transparency and checks on the NSA for example if the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act FISA gets some data and then somebody looks at that data without permission they could spend up to ten years in prison Feinstein says she strongly supports the NSAs main US programme I think many people dont understand this NSA database programme It is very important and helps to protect this country she said Independent legal experts said they were worried about the Intelligence Committees bill Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice said The Intelligence Committee bill and the USA Freedom Act are two opposing visions of the relationship between Americans who do not break the law and the national security state The most important question is should the government have some reason to suspect wrongdoing before collecting Americans most personal information Leahy says yes Feinstein says no Democratic committee member Ron Wyden said that recent worries about NSA spying on foreign leaders took attention away from the more important problem of the NSA checking the data of people in the US My top priority is ending the collection of data on millions and millions of innocent Americans Feinstein said that she completely disagreed with the foreign leader spying that the NSA does for example on German Chancellor Angela Merkel But Feinstein agrees with the NSAs collection of Americans phone records Americans are making it clear that they never repeat never agreed to give up their freedom so that the country could appear to be safer Wyden said Were just going to continue to fight this battle Its going to be a long battle,The US Senate Intelligence Committee has approved a bill that would make the National Security Agencys bulk collection of US phone records more transparent but allow it to continue Introduced by Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein the bill lets the NSA continue to collect phone metadata of millions of Americans and allows the government to keep the data The bill passed the committee by an 114 vote and will now be voted on by the full Senate The bill allows analysts to search through the data if they think there is a reasonable suspicion that someone is associated with international terrorism The bill also allows the NSA to continue surveillance that is begun on foreigners outside the US if they enter the country for a period of up to 72 hours The bill is a direct challenge to another bill introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy that would end domestic phonerecords collection It was also opposed by leading Intelligence Committee member Mark Udall who said it did not go far enough The NSAs surveillance of Americans private information does not respect our constitutional values and needs fundamental reform Udall said Feinstein defended the NSA bulk collection programme but said there was a need to rebuild public trust The NSA callrecords programme is legal and I believe it contributes to our national security she said in a statement But more can and should be done to increase transparency and build public support for privacy protections in place Feinstein said the bill would also make a number of improvements to transparency and checks on the NSA for example someone who accesses data acquired under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act FISA by the United States without permission could spend up to ten years in prison There would also be a limit on the number of contacts an analyst can receive in response to a request for bulk communication records After the committees hearing had ended Feinstein strongly supported the NSAs main domestic programme I think theres huge misunderstanding about this NSA database programme and how vital it is to protecting this country she said Concern over the Intelligence Committees bill was expressed by independent legal experts Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice said The Intelligence Committee bill and the USA Freedom Act present two opposing visions of the relationship between lawabiding Americans and the national security state The fundamental question is should the government have some reason to suspect wrongdoing before collecting Americans most personal information to feed into its databases Leahy says yes Feinstein says no Democratic committee member Ron Wyden suggested that recent concern about NSA spying on foreign leaders had taken attention away from the real focus on mass surveillance in the US The statements that American intelligence officials have made about collecting data from foreign leaders is consistent with the understanding Ive had for years as a member of the Intelligence Committee he said That has implications for foreign policy My top priority is ending the mass surveillance digital surveillance on millions and millions of lawabiding Americans To everyones surprise Feinstein announced that she was totally opposed to the foreign leader spying of the sort the NSA conducts on German Chancellor Angela Merkel Feinstein has been a strong supporter of the NSAs bulk collection of Americans phone records Americans are making it clear that they never repeat never agreed to give up their constitutional liberties for the appearance of security Wyden said Were just going to keep fighting this battle Its going to be a long one Feinsteins strong support for domestic phone records collection shows that she is not yet ready to expand the criticism of the NSA that she gave when she totally opposed its surveillance of foreign allied leaders a more traditional intelligence activity than bulk phone metadata surveillance Decades ago countries had their own kinds of communication systems Now that youve had the merger of global communications I think youre going to have a lot more challenges spying on foreigners with implications for US citizens Wyden said,train,ELE,INT
112,The UK prime minister David Cameron says he is happy about the result of the Scottish referendum 55 of people in Scotland voted to keep the 307yearold union with England and Wales and 45 voted against it The prime minister promised more devolution in Great Britain Earlier Scotlands rst minister Alex Salmond said he accepted Scotland had not decided to vote for independence this time He said the referendum was a triumph for democratic politics and he said he would work with the government in London in the best interests of Scotland and the rest of the UK We have touched sections of the community who have never before been touched by politics he said The yes campaign had four big successes it won 53 of the vote in Scotlands largest city Glasgow 57 in Dundee and 51 in North Lanarkshire But the no campaign won in 28 areas It won easily in areas where people expected it to do well including Edinburgh Aberdeenshire and Borders But it also did well in areas that people said might go to the yes campaign including the Western Isles In total the no campaign won 2001926 votes 553 and the yes campaign won 1617989 votes 447 In his speech Cameron said that there would be constitutional reforms including in Scotland but not until after the general election And he said that there would be changes in England too We have heard the voice of Scotland and now we must hear the millions of voices of England he said Cameron added The people of Scotland have spoken and it is a clear result They have kept our country of four nations together and like millions of other people I am delighted As I said during the campaign it would have broken my heart to see our United Kingdom come to an end So now it is time for our United Kingdom to come together and to move forward with a balanced settlement fair to people in Scotland and importantly to everyone in England Wales and Northern Ireland as well Ed Miliband the leader of the Labour Party said the referendum was a vote from the Scottish people for change We know our country needs to change We will deliver stronger powers for a stronger Scottish parliament a strong Scotland But he said that would go beyond Scotland We will also make changes in England Wales and the whole of the United Kingdom Nick Clegg the deputy prime minister said a vote against independence was not a vote against change We must now deliver the radical new powers to Scotland he added The UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage said Camerons offer of more devolution for England did not go far enough The English are 86 by population of this union Theyve not been a part of this for the last 18 years We still have a situation where Scottish MPs can vote in the House of Commons on Englishonly issues I think what most English people want is a fair settlement he said Cameron will try to calm tensions when he makes another statement on the result The prime minister will explain how he will give more powers to the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh The prime minister wants to move fast to show that the three main UK party leaders will keep the promises they made during the referendum campaign,The UK prime minister David Cameron has declared a clear result in the Scottish independence referendum Scotland voted by a 106point margin against ending the 307year old union with England and Wales The prime minister promised a devolution revolution in Great Britain as he welcomed Scotlands decision to remain inside the UK There can be no disputes no reruns we have heard the will of the Scottish people he said in a statement Earlier Scotlands rst minister Alex Salmond remained de ant at a Scottish National Party rally in Edinburgh he said he accepted Scotland had not at this stage decided to vote for independence He said the referendum was a triumph for democratic politics and he would work with the government in London in the best interests of Scotland and the rest of the UK We have touched sections of the community who have never before been touched by politics he said The yes campaign won four big successes it won 53 of the vote in Scotlands largest city Glasgow 57 in Dundee and 51 in North Lanarkshire However the no campaign was victorious in 28 authorities It won easily in areas where it was expected to do well including Edinburgh Aberdeenshire and Borders but also in areas that could have gone to the yes campaign including the Western Isles In the nal count the no camp won 2001926 votes 553 and the yes camp won 1617989 votes 447 In his speech Cameron made clear that there would be constitutional reforms including in Scotland but not until after the general election He also said that Scottish measures would happen in tandem with changes in England We have heard the voice of Scotland and now the millions of voices of England must be heard he said Cameron added The people of Scotland have spoken and it is a clear result They have kept our country of four nations together and like millions of other people I am delighted As I said during the campaign it would have broken my heart to see our United Kingdom come to an end And I know that feeling was shared by people not just across our country but around the world because of what we have achieved together in the past and what we can do together in the future So now it is time for our United Kingdom to come together and to move forward A vital part of that will be a balanced settlement fair to people in Scotland and importantly to everyone in England Wales and Northern Ireland as well Ed Miliband the leader of the Labour Party said the referendum was a vote from the Scottish people for change We know our country needs to change We will deliver stronger powers for a stronger Scottish parliament a strong Scotland But he said that would go beyond Scotland We will also meet the desire for change across England across Wales across the whole of the United Kingdom Nick Clegg the deputy prime minister said the referendum was not only a new chapter for Scotland within the UK but also wider constitutional reform across the union He said a vote against independence was not a vote against change We must now deliver on time and in full the radical package of newly devolved powers to Scotland he added Yet that result raises the risk of further problems MPs from Camerons Conservative Party are threatening to vote against the prime ministers promise to quickly increase the Scottish parliaments powers and protect its spending The UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage said Camerons offer of more devolution for England did not go far enough The English are 86 by population of this union Theyve been left out of all of this for the last 18 years We still have a situation where Scottish MPs can vote in the House of Commons on Englishonly issues I think what most English people want is a fair settlement he said Cameron will try to calm tensions when he makes another statement on the result The prime minister will explain how he will deliver further devolution to Scotland including giving greater powers over tax and welfare to the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh The prime minister wants to move fast to show that the three main UK party leaders will meet the commitments they made during the referendum campaign For the no campaign there was relief a number of opinion polls in the nal days of the campaign had said the vote was on a knifeedge This brought Yes Scotland within touching distance of victory after a dramatic surge in support,train,ELE,INT
9,Nobody knows which came first the economic crisis in Greece or shisha the drug that is called the cocaine of the poor But everyone agrees that shisha is a killer And it costs only 2 or less It is the worst drug It burns your insides it makes you aggressive and makes you go mad said Maria an exheroin addict But it is cheap and it is easy to get and everyone is taking it This drug crisis is making problems for Athenss health authorities who already have the problem of large financial cuts Thousands of homeless Greeks who live on the streets because of poverty and a loss of hope are taking shisha The drug is related to crystal meth It is often mixed with battery acid engine oil and even shampoo It can make users become aggressive And even worse it is easy to buy and easy to make It is a killer but it also makes you want to kill Konstantinos a drug addict said You can kill without understanding that you have done it A lot of users have died Charalampos Poulopoulos the director of Kethea Greeces antidrug centre said shisha is an austerity drug it is made by dealers who have become clever at making drugs for addicts who can no longer afford heroin and cocaine The crisis has given dealers the possibility to sell a new cheap drug a cocaine for the poor said Poulopoulos You can sniff or inject shisha and you can make it at home you dont need any special knowledge It is extremely dangerous In all parts of Greece there is a lot of depression and drug and alcohol abuse Crime has increased because austerity measures have cut the income of ordinary Greeks by 40 Prostitution the easiest way to pay for drugs has also increased There are more suicides and HIV infections and drug addicts around 25000 people have become more and more selfdestructive Sixtyfour per cent of young people in Greece are unemployed this is the highest youth unemployment in the EU At the time when organizations such as Kethea need extra help the Greek state has cut by a third the money it gives them The European Commission European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund asked them to do this to help save the Greek economy Since the economic crisis began in 2009 Kethea has lost 70 of its 500 staff They get less money but studies show that for every euro the Greek state spends on antidrug programmes such as Kethea it saves about 6 because there is less crime and fewer health problems The cuts are a huge mistake said Poulopoulos On the streets of Athens there is a fear that austerity not only doesnt work it kills,Nobody knows which came first the economic crisis in Greece or shisha the drug now known as the cocaine of the poor But what everyone knows is that shisha is a killer And it costs only 2 or less a hit It is the worst kind of drug It burns your insides it makes you aggressive and makes you go totally mad said Maria a former heroin addict But it is cheap and it is easy to get and it is what everyone is taking This drug crisis has put Athenss health authorities already having to deal with large financial cuts under further strain The drug of preference for thousands of homeless Greeks forced on to the streets by poverty and despair shisha is described by both addicts and officials as a drug that is related to crystal meth The synthetic drug is frequently mixed with battery acid engine oil and even shampoo It has the potential to send users into a state of mindless violence And even worse it is not only easily available but also easy to make It is a killer but it also makes you want to kill Konstantinos a drug addict said You can kill without understanding that you have done it And it is spreading faster than death A lot of users have died For Charalampos Poulopoulos the head of Kethea Greeces antidrug centre shisha symbolizes the crisis that has led to record levels of destitution and unemployment It is he said an austerity drug it is the response of dealers who have become more and more clever at producing synthetic drugs designed for those who can no longer afford more expensive highs from such drugs as heroin and cocaine The crisis has given dealers the possibility to promote a new cheap drug a cocaine for the poor said Poulopoulos at a centre for addicts in Exarcheia in Athens Shisha can be sniffed or injected and it can be made in home laboratories you dont need any specialized knowledge It is extremely dangerous Across Greece six years of recession have been brutal and cruel Depression together with drug and alcohol abuse has risen dramatically Crime has soared as a result of austerity measures that have cut the income of ordinary Greeks by 40 Prostitution the easiest way of paying for drugs has similarly skyrocketed Many women agree to have unprotected sex because that way theyll make more money said Eleni Marini a psychologist with Kethea Shisha has been linked to a very intense sexual drive but it attacks your ability to think clearly and were seeing a lot more pregnancies among drug addicts who engage in prostitution In 2012 two sex workers gave birth on the streets of Athens As the number of suicides has also increased and HIV infections are spreading drug addicts a population believed to be around 25000 have become increasingly selfdestructive And experts say young Greeks marginalized by record rates of unemployment at 64 Greece has the highest youth unemployment in the EU are leading the way The crisis has created a widespread sense of pessimism said Poulopoulos For those who might have stopped taking drugs there is now no incentive Instead theres an atmosphere of misery where people who know they wont find work are becoming a lot more selfdestructive In Athens where the economic crisis has hit hardest shisha is part of that Just when the need for help has never been greater statefunded organizations such as Kethea have had their money cut by a third at the request of the European Commission European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund These organizations are trying to stop the Greek economy from sinking Since the financial crisis began in 2009 Kethea has lost 70 of its 500 staff The cuts come despite studies that show that for every euro they spend on antidrug programmes such as Kethea the Greek state saves about 6 in costs to the criminal justice and healthcare systems The cuts we have witnessed are a false economy a huge mistake said Poulopoulos On the streets of Athens where shisha is growing in popularity there is a fear that austerity not only doesnt work it kills,train,ELE,INT
32,Do you want your child to be good at sport play for the school team and maybe one day even be in international competitions Well try to make sure that your child is born in November or October A study by a top expert on childrens physical activity has found that schoolchildren born in November or October are tter than everyone else in their class Children born in November or October were tter stronger and more powerful than children born in the other ten months of the year They are especially tter stronger and more powerful than children with birthdays in April or June Dr Gavin Sandercock of Essex University and his colleagues found that children born in the autumn had a clear physical advantage over their classmates The research involved 8550 boys and girls aged between ten and 16 from 26 state schools in Essex All were tested between 2007 and 2010 on three different things stamina handgrip strength and lowerbody power The results showed that a childs month of birth could make big differences to their levels of tness muscle strength and ability to accelerate all of which predict how good someone is at sport November children were the ttest because they had the most stamina and power and were the second strongest Children born in October were almost as t they scored highest for strength and came third for power with December children close behind The gap in physical ability between children in the same class but born in different months was sometimes very wide For example we found that a boy born in November can run at least 10 faster jump 12 higher and is 15 more powerful than a child of the same age born in April This is a huge physical advantage said Sandercock These gaps could decide who became a toplevel athlete because selection into elite sports may often depend on very small differences in a persons physical performance The study found that when scores for the three kinds of tness were put together children born in April were the least t followed by children born in June The ndings seem to show that children born in the early months of the school year enjoy a double autumn advantage we already know that they have an academic advantage and now they also seem to be better at sport too The authors of the study believe that the most likely explanation is that children born in autumn get more vitamin D over the summer months towards the end of pregnancy John Steele chief executive of the Youth Sport Trust said the quality of a young persons introduction to sport at school can be a major factor in their sporting development Children that get a highquality rst experience will have greater agility balance and coordination and are more likely to develop an enjoyment of physical activity and be good at sport as they grow up he said UK Sport could not say if a majority of the 1300 athletes it gives money to were born in November and October Natalie Dunman its head of performance said that the differences shown in the new study were true for teenagers in juniorlevel competitions but that the differences disappear before sportspeople were in adult competitions She said With adult athletes there are many factors that make a champion and we dont think that month of birth is one of the key ingredients,Do you want your child to be good at sport play for the school team and maybe one day even compete in international

For example we found that a boy born in November can run at least 10 faster jump 12 higher and is 15 more powerful than a child of the same age born in April This is potentially a huge physical advantage said Sandercock Such gaps could decide who became a toplevel athlete because as the paper says selection into elite sports may often depend on very small margins or differences in an individuals physical performance The study which has been published in the International Journal of Sports Medicine found that when scores for the three kinds of tness were combined those born in April were the least t then those in June That could see those children excluded from school teams and becoming sporting underachievers Sandercock said The ndings seem to show that children born in the early months of the school year enjoy a double autumn advantage they are already known to have an academic advantage and now they also appear to be better equipped for sport too The results show that something other than the relativeage effect the greater maturity of those born early in the school year is the cause especially as the ttest children were not the tallest or heaviest he added The authors believe that autumnborn childrens greater exposure over the summer months towards the end of pregnancy to vitamin D is the most likely explanation Seasonal differences in vitamin D concentrations in the womb seem most plausible they say John Steele chief executive of the Youth Sport Trust said the quality of a young persons introduction to sport at school can be a major factor

that her funeral will be at St Pauls Cathedral The British prime minister David Cameron said I was very sad when l heard of Lady Thatchers death Weve lost a great leader a great prime minister and a great Briton He added She was our first woman prime minister and she didnt just lead our country she saved our country He added that he believed she would be remembered as the greatest British peacetime prime minister President Barack Obama said Here in America many of us will never forget her close friendship with President Reagan Margaret Thatcher was the first woman leader of an important western state She was prime minister for 11 years until members of her own party removed her in 1990 When they heard of her death politicians from all parties sent tributes British Labour Party leader Ed Miliband said She will be remembered as a unique person She changed the politics of a whole generation She was Britains first woman prime minister She was a huge figure in the world The Labour Party disagreed with a lot of what she did but we can disagree and also greatly respect her political achievements and her personal strength The former Conservative prime minister Sir John Major said that people who worked closely with her would always remember her courage and determination in politics and her humanity and generous spirit in private The Iron Lady was a close ally of the US president Ronald Reagan in the final years of the Soviet Union The Union broke up because of reforms introduced by Mikhail Gorbachev He was the Russian leader who Thatcher liked and worked closely with As a result many ordinary people in exCommunist countries still think of her as someone who supported their freedom It was a surprise when Thatcher became party leader in 1975 Within ten years she had become famous around the world people both admired and hated her for her reforms in the UK and her strong beliefs in foreign policy She had a long battle with the IRA which almost killed her with a bomb in 1984 In the UK Thatchers main economic policy was the denationalization of stateowned industry the new word privatization became used in many countries She also defeated militant trade unions particularly the National Union of Miners after a long and terrible strike that lasted almost a year With money from Britains North Sea oil fields she was able to change the ageing industrial economy and she used the opportunity to defeat her enemies including some members of her own party As the British economy became healthy again after the problems that her policies caused it seemed for a short time that noone would ever defeat her But as her friends and supporters retired or were replaced she started to make mistakes and became more and more unpopular Finally in 1990 after a vote among Conservative MPs failed to support her John Major took control of the party After she retired she wrote her memoirs and continued to promote her values around the world,Margaret Thatcher the best known British prime minister since Winston Churchill in 1940 and a global supporter of free market economics has died The British government announced that she would receive a ceremonial funeral at St Pauls Cathedral The British prime minister David Cameron said It was with great sadness that l learned of Lady Thatchers death Weve lost a great leader a great prime minister and a great Briton He added As our first woman prime minister Margaret Thatcher succeeded against all the odds and she didnt just lead our country she saved our country He added that he believed she would be remembered as the greatest British peacetime prime minister In a statement President Barack Obama said Here in America many of us will never forget her standing shoulder to shoulder with President Reagan reminding the world that we can shape the currents of history with our moral beliefs courage and iron will The first woman elected to lead a major western state Margaret Thatcher served 11 years at No 10 Downing Street before members of her own party removed her in 1990 Thatcher who was 87 had been in poor health for some years suffering from dementia When they heard of her death politicians from all parties sent tributes Labour Party leader Ed Miliband said She will be remembered as a unique figure She reshaped the politics of a whole generation She was Britains first woman prime minister She moved the centre ground of British politics and was a huge figure on the world stage The Labour Party disagreed with a lot of what she did and she will always be a controversial figure But we can disagree and also greatly respect her political achievements and her personal strength The deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said Margaret Thatcher was one of the most important figures in modern British politics Whatever party you support no one can deny that as prime minister she left a unique and lasting imprint on the country she served Describing her as a political phenomenon the former Conservative prime minister Sir John Major said Her outstanding characteristics will always be remembered by those who worked closely with her courage and determination in politics and humanity and generosity of spirit in private The Iron Lady was a cold war ally of the US president Ronald Reagan in the final showdown with the Soviet Union which broke up as a result of reformist pressures led by Mikhail Gorbachev a Kremlin leader with whom Thatcher famously said she could do business As a result many ordinary voters in exSoviet bloc states saw her as someone who supported their liberty Thatcher was an unremarkable Conservative until she unexpectedly became party leader in 1975 Within ten years she had become known around the world both admired and hated for her promarket reforms in the UK and her implacable attitudes in foreign policy including her long battle with the IRA which almost succeeded in murdering her with a bomb in 1984 At home Thatcher was associated with denationalization of stateowned industry the new word privatization became used in many countries and defeat of militant trade unions particularly the National Union of Miners whose oneyear strike 198485 was traumatic With money from Britains North Sea oil fields Thatcher was able to change the ageing industrial economy and she used the opportunity to defeat her enemies including moderate members of her own party In the European Union she got a rebate for Britain my money as she called it She was less successful in controlling the European Commission who wanted to centralize power in Europe especially in the years when it was led by the French socialist Jacques Delors As the British economy recovered from the very bad recession that her policies had caused she seemed invincible for a short time But unlimited power and the defeat or retirement of allies led to mistakes and increasing unpopularity When her deputy finally fell out with her mainly on the subject of Europe his damaging resignation speech led to a leadership challenge After a vote among Conservative MPs failed to support her John Major took control of the party After she retired she wrote highly successful

country is only in eighth place and the UK is in 13th place Sri Lanka is 36th far above Pakistan at 89th although the countries have similar economies Bolivia and Mauritius are in higher positions than the size of their economies suggests Brazil and China are quite high but India and Russia are much lower This study shows that history is important said Mark Gorman director of HelpAge International The top countries are what you would expect but Scandinavian countries were not rich when they introduced pensions for everyone Older people in Sri Lanka today have good basic education and health care those countries decided to help older people No country has enough money but when they decide how to spend their money they should not forget older people The study includes 91 countries and 89 of the worlds older people The study comes at a time of big population changes by 2050 there will probably be two billion people aged 60 and over which will be more than a fifth of the worlds population Population ageing when older people are a larger and larger percentage of the population is happening fastest in developing countries More than twothirds of older people live in poor countries by 2050 this proportion will probably be about fourfifths The fastest ageing countries Jordan Laos Mongolia Nicaragua and Vietnam are in the lower half of the ranking which suggests that politicians there need to look at the problem of ageing so that they can give enough support to their populations There are also differences between men and women in ageing populations women generally live longer than men In 2012 for every 84 men aged 60 and over there were 100 women However population ageing does not always mean more health care spending according to the report which shows the importance of longterm investments in education and health care for older people Bolivia ranked 46 is one of the poorest countries but it has introduced good policies for older people a national plan on ageing free health care and a pension for everyone Chile and Costa Rica introduced good basic health care many years ago and this has helped the ageing populations of those countries A good education system is very useful later in life basic literacy is very important for older people when they have to read and complete pensions documents In the Philippines the educational reforms introduced after independence in 1946 have helped older people elementary and high school education became compulsory The same is true for Armenia which like other countries of the exSoviet Union had a strong education system South Korea is a surprisingly low 67 in the ageing study partly because it introduced a pension only recently It is clear that countries all over the world should do more to help their ageing populations,Sweden is the best country for older people Afghanistan the worst but the general wealth of a country does not always mean better conditions for the over60s according to the first global index on ageing Swedens top ranking followed by Norway Germany the Netherlands and Canada is predictable but the Global AgeWatch index provides some surprising results The US the worlds richest country is only in eighth place while the UK is 13th Sri Lanka is 36th far above Pakistan at 89th despite similar levels of gross domestic product GDP Bolivia and Mauritius score higher than the size of their economies may suggest and while Brazil and China are relatively high on the index India and Russia are much lower This survey shows that history counts said Mark Gorman director of HelpAge International The topranked countries are what you would expect but Scandinavian countries were not wealthy when they introduced pensions for everyone The older population in Sri Lanka today is benefiting from good basic education and health care those countries made certain policy choices Everybody has scarce resources but they should not forget that when they make investment decisions they should also consider issues of old age The index developed with the UN Fund for Population and Development covers 91 countries and 89 of the worlds older people The survey comes during a major demographic change by 2050 there are expected to be two billion people aged 60 and over making up more than a fifth of the worlds population Population ageing when older people form an increasingly large proportion of people is happening fastest in developing countries More than twothirds of older people live in poor countries by 2050 this proportion is expected to be about fourfifths The fastest ageing countries Jordan Laos Mongolia Nicaragua and Vietnam are in the lower half of the ranking which suggests that politicians there need to look at the question of ageing if they are to provide enough support to their populations There are gender differences among ageing populations with women generally living longer than men In 2012 for every 84 men aged 60 and over there were 100 women Many women face disadvantages in old age because of lack of paid work and therefore also savings less decisionmaking power in the family and the fact that they are vulnerable to violence However population ageing does not always lead to significantly higher health care spending according to the report which highlights the importance of longterm investments in education and health care for older people Bolivia ranked 46 despite being one of the poorest countries has introduced good policies for older people with a national plan on ageing free health care and a noncontributory pension for everyone Good basic health care introduced decades ago in Chile and Costa Rica has helped the ageing populations of those countries A good education system is of great benefit later in life basic literacy is crucial for older people as they deal with the pensions paperwork In the Philippines older people have benefited from the educational reforms introduced after independence in 1946 which made elementary and high school education compulsory The same is true for Armenia which like other countries of the former Soviet Union benefited from a strong education system South Korea came a surprisingly low 67 on the ageing index partly because it introduced a pension only recently The ageing index is calculated using 13 indicators under four headings income security health care employment and education and a positive environment All indicators have equal weight except for pension income coverage life expectancy at 60 healthy life expectancy at 60 and psychological wellbeing These categories have increased importance because of better data quality and countries were included only if there was enough data Professor Sir Richard Jolly creator of the human development index said This groundbreaking index helps us to better understand the needs and opportunities of older people thanks to its pioneering application of human development methodology

140,Roger McKinlay is the former president of the Royal Institute of Navigation He says that our use of GPS global positioning system technology is damaging our ability to nd our way If we do not look after them we will lose our natural navigation abilities because we rely on technology more and more he wrote McKinlay believes it will take a lot of time and money before navigation systems will be good enough for technologies such as driverless cars to become successful He says we need better research into systems for navigation Also children should learn to nd their way using more traditional methods Schools should teach navigation and map reading he wrote In 2012 39 of adults in the UK had a smartphone In 2015 66 of adults had a smartphone So most people now use GPS technology But McKinlay a satellite communication and navigation consultant believes that we should be careful not to only use our smartphones for navigation If we dont practise using our navigation skills we will lose them he wrote Research from 2009 supports this idea We studied a group of current London taxi drivers and a group of retired London taxi drivers said Dr Hugo Spiers of University College London who is an author of the study The results showed that the retired taxi drivers did worse on navigation tests than the current drivers We were able to show that their abilities decreased after they stopped using their knowledge Spiers also believes it is dangerous to rely on technologies like GPS But he says that the biggest problem is that technologies can lead drivers into dangerous situations One of the deaths caused by satnavs satellite navigation was of a driver who in 2010 drove into a lake in Spain It can be dangerous to use a satnav said Spiers The way we use navigation technology also has an impact on our own abilities says Spiers If drivers listen to instructions they dont need to think about where they are going he says but the use of smartphone apps as digital maps is better When you use digital maps you have to think hard about where you are going he said McKinlay believes there have to be big improvements in navigation technologies before we can have futuristic things like driverless cars and smart cities For really important jobs like landing aeroplanes or ying aeroplanes GPS is still not good enough he said McKinlay believes humans must still able to take control of their navigation We dont want people to go into total shock when their smartphone disappears or the battery goes at he said Technology isnt magic it is just a tool,Former president of the Royal Institute of Navigation Roger McKinlay says that our use of GPS global positioning system technology could be damaging our innate ability to nd our way If we do not look after them our natural navigation abilities will deteriorate as we rely more and more on technology he wrote McKinlay believes we need huge investment before navigation systems will be good enough for technologies such as autonomous vehicles to take off In the meantime he says we need better research into systems for navigation Also children should be encouraged to learn how to nd their way around by more traditional means Schools should teach navigation and map reading as life skills he wrote According to Ofcom the Of ce of Communications around 66 of adults in the UK owned a smartphone in 2015 up from 39 in 2012 so GPS technology is widely available But McKinlay a satellite communication and navigation consultant believes that we should be careful not to leave our navigational needs to our devices If we dont practise using our navigation skills well lose them he wrote Not many scienti c studies have explored the issue but research from 2009 supports his ideas We looked at a group of current London taxi drivers and a group of London taxi drivers that had been retired for about four years said neuroscientist Dr Hugo Spiers of University College London who is an author of the study The results showed that the retired taxi drivers performed worse on navigation tests than the current taxi drivers We were able to show that their abilities dropped away if they werent using their knowledge Spiers also believes there is a danger in relying on technologies like GPS but he points out that the biggest problem is that technologies can lead drivers into dangerous situations One of the deaths caused by satnavs satellite navigation devices was of a driver whose car plunged into a lake in Spain in 2010 There is a genuine potential danger in relying on a satnav said Spiers But the health risk of not using your brain effectively is not known The way in which navigational technology is used could also affect its impact on our own abilities says Spiers Audio instructions to drivers remove the need to think about navigation he says but the use of smartphone apps as digital maps is very different When you use a digital map you have to think hard about where you are going and interact with this device he said The modern technology isnt just dumbing us down completely McKinlay believes there have to be big improvements in navigation technologies before futuristic scenarios of driverless cars and smart cities become a reality For really important jobs like landing aircraft or navigating aircraft GPS is still not good enough he said Spiers believes the development of arti cial intelligence based on machine learning could lead to a new wave of navigational aids but McKinlay is sceptical We will see eversmarter machines which are very very task speci c but the big breakthrough will be when they understand what we are thinking and what we want to achieve he said Ultimately McKinlay believes its essential that humans remain able to take control of their navigation Do you really want to encourage people to a point where when it disappears or when the battery goes at they are in total shock and can do nothing he said Technology isnt magic it is just a tool,train,ELE,INT
147,Scientists have put a false memory in the brains of mice in an experiment They hope the results of the experiment will help to explain why people remember things that never happened False memories are sometimes a problem with eyewitness statements in courts of law Eyewitnesses often give evidence that leads to guilty verdicts but later those verdicts may be changed when DNA or some other evidence is used Susumu Tonagawa a scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT and his team wanted to study how these false memories form in the human brain They put memories in the brains of mice by changing individual neurons In the experiment Tonagawas team put the mice in a box and allowed them to explore it As they explored it their brain cells created a memory The next day they put the same mice in a second box and gave them a small electric shock This scared the mice At the same time the researchers shone light into the mouse brains to bring back their memories of the first box That way the mice associated fear of the electric shock with the memory of the first box In the final part of the experiment the team put the mice back in the first box The mice froze because they were scared However they had not received the shock in the first box and had no reason to be afraid A similar thing may happen when powerful false memories are created in humans Humans are very imaginative animals said Tonagawa So just like our mouse it is quite possible we can associate what we have in our mind with bad or good events In other words there could be a false association of what you have in your mind rather than what is happening to you He added Our study showed that the false memory and the real memory use very similar almost identical brain mechanisms It is difficult to tell the difference between them We hope our future experiments will show legal experts how unreliable memory can be Chris French of the University of London is a researcher in false memories in people He said that the results of the experiments were an important first step in understanding false memories He added that memory researchers have always known that memory does not work like a video camera recording all the details of anything we experience Instead we build a memory from small pieces of memory of the event as well as information from other places He warned that the false memories created in the mice in the experiments were far simpler than the complex false memories people have such as false memories of childhood sexual abuse abduction by aliens or past lives These complex false memories involve many parts of the brain French says that it will be a long time before we understand how our brains make these memories The mouse models created by the MIT team will help scientists ask more complex questions about memories in people Now that we can change the contents of memories in the brain we can begin asking questions that used to be philosophical questions said Steve Ramirez who works with Tonagawa at MIT Can we create false memories What about false memories for more than just places false memories for objects food or other mice These used to be scifi questions but we can now research them in the lab,Scientists have implanted a false memory in the brains of mice in an experiment that they hope will help to explain why people remember events or experiences that have never happened False memories are a major problem with witness statements in courts of law Evidence that eyewitnesses give often leads to guilty verdicts but later the convictions are overturned when DNA or some other evidence is used Susumu Tonagawa a neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT and his team wanted to study how these false memories might form in the human brain so they encoded memories in the brains of mice by manipulating individual neurons Memories of experiences we have had are made from several elements including records of objects space and time These records are encoded in physical and chemical changes in brain cells and the connections between them According to Tonagawa both false and genuine memories seem to use the same brain mechanisms In the experiment Tonagawas team put the mice in a box and allowed them to explore it As they did so their brain cells were producing a memory protein The next day the same mice were put in a second box and given a small electric shock to encode a fear response At the same time the researchers shone light into the mouse brains to activate their memories of the first box That way the mice learned to associate fear of the electric shock with the memory of the first box In the final part of the experiment the team put the mice back in the first box The mice froze showing a typical fear response even though they had never been shocked in that box A similar process may happen when powerful false memories are created in humans Humans are very imaginative animals said Tonagawa So just like our mouse it is quite possible we can associate what we happen to have in our mind with bad or good events In other words there could be a false association of what you have in your mind rather than what is happening to you He added Our study showed that the false memory and the genuine memory are based on very similar almost identical brain mechanisms It is difficult for the person with false memories to distinguish between them We hope our future findings along this line will show legal experts how unreliable memory can be Chris French of the University of London is a leading researcher in false memories in people He said that the latest results were an important first step in understanding them Memory researchers have always recognized that memory does not work like a video camera recording all the details of anything we experience Instead it is a reconstructive process which involves building a specific memory from fragments of real memory traces of the original event but also possibly including information from other sources He warned that the false memories created in the mice in the experiments were far simpler than the complex false memories that have caused controversy within psychology and psychiatry for example false memories of childhood sexual abuse abduction by aliens or past lives Such rich false memories will clearly involve many brain systems and we are still a long way from understanding the processes involved in their formation at the neuronal level he said Mark Stokes a neuroscientist at Oxford University said the experiments were a great achievement but that it was important to put them into perspective Although the results seem to show that new memories were formed by the artificial stimulation rather than the actual environment this kind of phenomenon is still a long way from most peoples idea of memory he said The mouse models created by the MIT team will help scientists ask more and more complex questions about memories in people Now that we can change the contents of memories in the brain we can begin asking questions that were once the realm of philosophy said Steve Ramirez a colleague of Tonagawas at MIT Are there multiple conditions that lead to the formation of false memories Can false memories be artificially created What about false memories for more than just contexts false memories for objects food or other mice These are the seemingly scifi questions that can now be experimentally tackled in the lab As the technology develops said French scientists need to think about its uses carefully In whatever way we implant false memories we need to be very aware of the ethical issues raised by such procedures the potential for abuse of such techniques cannot be overstated,train,ELE,INT
160,A new study shows that there are more and more brown bears wolves and lynx in the forests and suburban areas of Europe Rising human populations and use of resources have made many people believe that these animals could soon become extinct But the study says that numbers of large predators are stable or rising in Europe Brown bears wolves and the Eurasian lynx are found in nearly onethird of mainland Europe excluding Belarus Ukraine and Russia Most live outside nature reserves this shows that changing attitudes and conservation methods are protecting these species very well Bears are the most common large carnivore in Europe there are around 17000 bears There are 12000 wolves and 9000 Eurasian lynx Only Belgium Denmark the Netherlands and Luxembourg in mainland Europe have no breeding populations of at least one large carnivore species Britain also has none But the study said these animals live in regions of Europe where lots of people live and this shows that they could live even in the British countryside Guillaume Chapron from Swedens University of Agricultural Sciences and researchers across Europe found wolves living in suburban areas with up to 3050 people per square kilometre On average in Europe wolves live on land where there are 37 people per square kilometre lynx in areas where there are 21 people per square kilometre and bears where there are 19 people per square kilometre In the Scottish Highlands there are just nine people per square kilometre To have wolves we dont need to remove people from the landscape said Chapron He also said that the big carnivore revival shows the success of a landsharing method of conservation it is different from the method in North America and Africa where they use fences to separate these animals in wilderness areas Im not saying its a perfect love story living together often means conflict but its important to control that conflict and resolve the problems it causes Wolves can be difficult neighbours said Chapron According to the researchers countries in other parts of the world could use this landsharing method Landsharing works in Europe because there are more and more animals such as wild deer for the predators to eat and there is money for electric fences to protect livestock fences so farmers do not have to shoot wild predators Most important said Chapron is the EU Habitats Directive which has forced member states to protect and revive rare species Without the Habitats Directive I dont think we would have had this revival he said It shows that we can protect animals if people really want to help and if politicians make strong laws Author George Monbiot was happy about the revival He is starting a charity called Rewilding Britain It encourages the return of wild landscape and extinct species It is great to see more of these animals in Europe But Britain is completely different weve lost more of our large animals than any country except for Ireland he said We accidentally reintroduced wild boar but weve done nothing else In much of the rest of Europe weve got bears lynx and wolves coming back If it works in the rest of Europe theres absolutely no reason why it cant work in the UK he said He added that bears and wolves live less than an hour away from Rome Theres no reason why we cant have a similar return of wildlife in the UK,The forests and suburbs of Europe are echoing with the growls and howls of large predators according to a new study The study shows that brown bears wolves and lynx are thriving on the crowded continent Rising human populations and overconsumption make many people believe that such animals will soon become extinct But the study has found that largepredator populations are stable or rising in Europe Brown bears wolves and the Eurasian lynx are found in nearly onethird of mainland Europe excluding Belarus Ukraine and Russia with most living outside nature reserves This indicates that changing attitudes and conservation measures are successfully protecting species that have suffered massive persecution throughout human history Bears are the most abundant large carnivore in Europe there are around 17000 of them There are 12000 wolves and 9000 Eurasian lynx Only Belgium Denmark the Netherlands and Luxembourg in mainland Europe like Britain have no breeding populations of at least one large carnivore species But the studys main author and other conservationists said that these animals now live in wellpopulated regions of Europe so even the British countryside could support big predators Guillaume Chapron from Swedens University of Agricultural Sciences and researchers across Europe found wolves in some cases living in suburban areas alongside up to 3050 people per square kilometre On average in Europe wolves live on land with a population density of 37 people per sq km lynx in areas with a population density of 21 people per sq km and bears among 19 people per sq km The population density of the Scottish Highlands is just nine people per sq km In order to have wolves we dont need to remove people from the landscape said Chapron He adds that the bigcarnivore revival shows the success of a landsharing model of conservation unlike the policy of keeping predators and people apart by fencing off wilderness areas as occurs in North America and Africa Im not saying its a peaceandlove story coexistence often means conflict but its important to manage that conflict and resolve the problems it causes Wolves can be difficult neighbours said Chapron We shouldnt be talking about peoplepredator conflict we have conflict between people about predators These animals are symbolic of difficult questions about how we should use the land According to the researchers this landsharing approach could be applied elsewhere in the world The reasons for its success in Europe include political stability growing populations of prey species such as wild deer and financial support for nonlethal livestock protection such as electric fences which mean that farmers do not have to shoot wild predators Most crucial said Chapron has been the EU Habitats Directive which has forced member states to protect and revive rare species Without the Habitats Directive I dont think we would have had this recovery he said It shows that if people are willing to protect nature and if politicians introduce strong legislation its possible to achieve results in wildlife protection The revival was welcomed by author George Monbiot who is launching Rewilding Britain a new charity to encourage the return of wild landscape and extinct species It is great to see this trend continuing but Britain is completely anomalous weve lost more of our large mammals than any country except for Ireland he said Apart from the accidental reintroduction of wild boar weve done almost nothing whereas in much of the rest of Europe weve got bears lynx and wolves coming back The survey found that the Eurasian lynx lives permanently in 11 population groups in 23 European countries and only five of these were native populations This indicates the success of reintroduction efforts According to Monbiot support for the reintroduction of the lynx into the Scottish mountains is growing If it works in the rest of Europe theres absolutely no reason why it cant work in the UK he said He points out that bears and wolves live within an hour of Rome Theres no reason why we cant have a similar return of wildlife in the UK,train,ELE,INT

127,A company from the Netherlands wants to turn dreams of reaching Mars into reality The company Mars One plans to send four astronauts to the Red Planet to build a human colony in 2023 But there are two serious problems Firstly on Mars the astronauts bodies will have to adapt to gravity that is 38 of gravity on Earth This would probably cause such a total change in their bones muscles and circulation that the astronauts would no longer be able to survive on Earth Secondly they will have to say goodbye to all their family and friends because there is no return ticket The Mars One website says that the astronauts cannot expect to return To return they would need a rocket that can leave Mars The rocket would need life support systems for a sevenmonth journey and would need to either join up with a space station or land safely on Earth But the project has already had 10000 applicants according to the companys Medical Director Norbert Kraft He told The Guardian that the applicants so far were aged 18 to at least 62 and although they include women they were mostly men Mars One says that the astronauts must be resilient adaptable curious trusting and resourceful They must also be over 18 Mars One says that the basic things people need to live are already present on the planet For example they can take water from ice in the soil and Mars has sources of nitrogen the primary element in the air we breathe The colony will use solar panels to get power it says The project will cost around 6 billion Some of this money could come from TV broadcasting rights The money made broadcasting the London Olympics was almost enough to pay for a mission to Mars Bas Lansdorp the companys founder said Another person who supports the project is Paul Rmer one of the creators of Big Brother one of the first and most successful reality TV shows This mission to Mars could be the biggest media event in the world said Rmer A reality show and a talent show with no ending and the whole world watching Mars One wants to build a permanent human colony according to its website The first team would land on Mars in 2023 to begin building the colony and a team of four astronauts would arrive every two years after that But some people are sceptical of the project and some people are worried about how astronauts might get to the planet and build a colony with all the life support and other things they need The mission hopes to inspire people to believe that all things are possible that you can achieve anything like the Apollo moon landings Mars One believes it is not only possible but necessary that we build a permanent colony on Mars so that we can improve our understanding of the solar system the origins of life and our place in the universe it says,A company from the Netherlands is trying to turn dreams of reaching Mars into reality The company Mars One plans to send four astronauts on a trip to the Red Planet to set up a human colony in 2023 But there are a couple of serious problems Firstly when on Mars the astronauts bodies will have to adapt to surface gravity that is 38 of that on Earth It is thought that this would cause such a total change in their bone density muscle strength and circulation that the astronauts would no longer be able to survive in Earths conditions Secondly and directly related to the first they will have to say goodbye to all their family and friends as there is no return ticket The Mars One website states that a return cannot be anticipated nor expected To return they would need a fully built rocket with enough fuel for the return journey which is able to escape the gravitational field of Mars and has onboard life support systems for a sevenmonth trip And they must be able to link up with a space station orbiting Earth or perform a safe reentry and landing Nevertheless the project has already had 10000 applicants according to the companys Medical Director Norbert Kraft He told The Guardian that the applicants so far ranged in age from 18 to at least 62 and though they include women they were mostly men The reasons they gave for wanting to go were varied he said An American woman called Cynthia who gave her age as 32 said that it was a childhood dream of hers to go to Mars She told the project When I first heard about the Mars One project I thought this is my chance that childhood dream could become a reality I could be one of the pioneers building the first colony on Mars and teaching people back home that there are still uncharted territories that humans can reach for The main attributes Mars One is looking for in astronautsettlers are resilience adaptability curiosity ability to trust and resourcefulness according to Kraft They must also be over 18 Mars One says that the basic things required for life are already present on the planet For instance water can be taken from ice in the soil and Mars has sources of nitrogen the primary element in the air we breathe The colony will be powered by specially adapted solar panels it says The project will cost a reported 6bn and Bas Lansdorp the founder of Mars One has said he hopes this money will be collected partly by selling broadcasting rights The broadcasting revenue from the London Olympics was almost enough to finance a mission to Mars Lansdorp said Another ambassador to the project is Paul Rmer the cocreator of Big Brother one of the first and most successful reality TV shows This mission to Mars could be the biggest media event in the world said Rmer Reality meets talent show with no ending and the whole

needed The mission hopes to inspire generations to believe that all things are possible that anything can be achieved like the Apollo moon landings Mars One believes it is not only possible but necessary that we establish a permanent colony on Mars in order to speed up our understanding of the formation of the solar system the origins of life and of equal importance our place in the universe

Berlin to create innovative electronic music Bowie was born David Robert Jones in south London At 15 David formed his first band the Konrads but it was soon clear that David should go solo David took the name Bowie so people wouldnt confuse him with Davy Jones of the Monkees Bowies first album released in June 1967 was titled simply David Bowie In July 1969 Bowie released Space Oddity the song that would give him his first big success Timed to coincide with the Apollo 11 moon landing it was a top five UK hit The Man Who Sold the World was released in the US in late 1970 and in the UK the following year With its daring songwriting and hardrock sound it was the first album to really show his talents He followed it with 1972s Hunky Dory a mix of wordy elaborate songwriting It was an excellent collection that was not a great success But that all changed with The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars later that year This time Bowie appeared as Ziggy Stardust a

84,When you enter a department store cameras are watching you If you pick something up a camera will make sure you dont put it into your bag Cameras will follow you around the store But new technology is less focused on shoplifting and more interested in your age gender and shopping habits A few months ago IT company Computer Sciences Corporation CSC wrote a report that said around 30 of stores use facial recognition technology to track customers in shops Facial recognition is a technology that can identify people it analyses and compares peoples faces Shops use special cameras for this like the Intel RealSense camera Joe Jensen who works for Intel says that the aim of using RealSense technology in shops is not to get information about speci c peoples lives but to understand in general peoples lifestyles and shopping habits We dont need to know a particular shopper We need to know what characteristics this shopper has and that when those characteristics are present this is what a person usually does This technology makes it possible to predict what a person may or may not do in a shop If for example a woman is walking quickly towards the sock section a store can automatically put ads on screens speci cally for that person If she looks like the type of person who wants to buy socks they will show her adverts for socks If it sounds familiar its because the internet has been using techniques like these for years If you search for something on Amazon youll get ads for similar products on other sites But its not easy to use these systems in shops People do not react to cameras in the same way as they do to cookies on websites One company Hoxton Analytics has developed a technology that puts people into categories based on the shoes they are wearing By analysing the style and size of peoples shoes the system can identify a customers gender with 7580 accuracy Owen McCormack Hoxton Analytics CEO says that they wanted the system to be different from facial recognition I thought why dont we simply look at the clothes someones wearing he said If I just showed you a photo of someones body you could probably tell me what gender they are But pointing a camera at someones body feels just as creepy as facial recognition The idea was what about peoples shoes People use the word creepy a lot during discussions of tracking in stores Stores need to nd a way of getting information without seeming intrusive McCormack says Right now shops are doing lots of intrusive things but we just dont know about it We tell the shops that if you know someones a male or a female your advertising will work better If you know that everyone in your shop right now is a male youll advertise PlayStations not hairdryers It is easy to understand that stores want some of the information online stores collect We allow this to happen online so why not in shops But shopping centres are different from websites you walk from one shop to another without a computer asking you if its ok to collect information about you But young people who are growing up with online shopping do not think online advertising is invasive In the CSC report a survey showed that 72 of people aged 55 or more said they were very uncomfortable with these types of technologies in real shops But only 51 of 1624 year olds said they were uncomfortable In any case there are more and more eyes watching you and they care a lot about what youre wearing,Behind the bright lights and mirrored panels cameras are watching you If you pick up a boot a camera will make sure you dont put it into your bag Enter a department store and you will be watched But new technology is less focused on shoplifting and more interested in your age sex and shopping habits A few months ago IT company Computer Sciences Corporation CSC wrote a report that said around 30 of stores use facial recognition technology to track customers instore Facial recognition is a technology that can identify people by analysing and comparing facial features from a database It uses devices such as Intel RealSense cameras which are able to analyse everything from particular expressions to the clothing brands someone is wearing Intel spokesman Joe Jensen says that the aim of using RealSense technology in shops is not to create databases of speci c peoples lives but to build generalized models of peoples lifestyles and shopping habits We dont need to know a particular customer We need to know that this shopper has these characteristics and that when those characteristics are present this is what a person tends to do If you combine recognition technology with databases of previous customer patterns you can start to predict a lot about what a person may or may not do in a shop If for example theres a woman walking quickly towards the sock section you can use that data to predict she wants to buy socks That could allow a store to automatically put targeted ads on screens aimed speci cally at that person If she looks like the type of person who wants to buy socks they will show her adverts for socks If it sounds familiar its because the online world has been using techniques like these for years If you search for something on Amazon youll get targeted ads for similar products on other sites But its not easy to bring these systems into the physical world People do not react to cameras in the same way as they do to browser cookies Hoxton Analytics a team of data scientists in London has developed a technology that uses machine learning and arti cial intelligence to categorize people based on the shoes they are wearing By analysing the style and size of peoples footwear as they walk past the sensor the system can identify a customers gender with 7580 accuracy Owen McCormack Hoxton Analytics CEO says that the focus of the system was partly a reaction to facial recognition My idea was why dont we simply consider the clothes someones wearing he said If I just showed you a photo of someones body you could probably tell me what gender they are However pointing a camera at someones chest or hips feels just as creepy as facial recognition The idea was what about peoples shoes People use the word creepy a lot during discussions of instore tracking For stores and data scientists the aim is to nd a way of getting information without seeming intrusive For McCormack the argument is based on the fact that personal information isnt collected Right now shops are doing lots of incredibly invasive things but we just dont know about it What we say is that if you know someones a male or a female then your advertising will be much more ef cient If you know that everyone in your shop right now is a male youll be advertising PlayStations not hairdryers From the perspective of stores its understandable that physical shops want some of the information online shops collect We allow this to happen online so why not of ine Online you get a popup asking you to accept cookies But you cant ask for peoples consent in the same way when they move from one physical shop to another But its also true that the generation that is growing up with online shopping does not see online advertising as so invasive In the CSC report a survey showed that 72 of people aged 55 or more said they were very uncomfortable with these types of technologies in physical shops But only 51 of 1624 year olds said they were uncomfortable Are younger people more open because they are more familiar with digital technology or do they believe in the honesty of organizations offering free services Is this kind of technology always creepy or does it depend In any case there are a growing number of eyes between the shelves and they care a lot about what youre wearing,train,ELE,INT

128,Noise from ships may disturb animals such as killer whales and dolphins much more than we thought before New research shows that underwater noise could stop these animals communicating and make it more dif cult for them to nd food It is well known that noise from ships disturbs large whales But US researchers have found noise also disturbs smaller sea creatures such as killer whales also known as orcas Dolphins and porpoises may have the same problems The main problem is that even a small increase in sound may make it more dif cult for whales to nd food using echo said Scott Veirs who led the research Thats worrying because their food a kind of salmon is already quite scarce Hearing a salmons click is probably one of the most dif cult things a killer whale does It is harder to hear that click if theres a lot of noise around you The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise made by about 1600 ships as they passed through Haro Strait in Washington State USA The twoyear study recorded the sound made by 12 different types of ship including cruise ships container ships and military ships that passed through the strait about 20 times a day Some ships are quieter than others but the average noise next to all the ships was 173 underwater decibels the same as 111 decibels through the air about the sound of a loud rock concert Whales are not usually right next to ships and so would hear noise of about 60 to 90 decibels around the level of a vacuum cleaner Veirs said scientists already knew about the effect of underwater noise on large whales But the new research shows the danger to smaller whales dolphins and porpoises We think that ships make lowfrequency noise like the sound of lorries or trains he said Most noise is at that low frequency but there is more background noise in the high frequencies too This might be causing a big problem that we need to study more Lots of underwater noise can cause many problems Whales may have to stay closer together to hear each other And if they cannot nd food easily they will need to use their extra blubber This is a problem because this blubber often contains manmade pollutants that are poisonous to whales if they get into their bodies Veirs said ships that pass near whales need to be quieter It should be easy to reduce noise pollution he said Military ships are much quieter and there could be simple ways of using that technology on normal ships Another way to reduce noise is to slow down Reducing speed by six knots could decrease noise by half Some whale species are safer now because there is less whaling but other types of whale are still in danger for many different reasons The US has recently protected nearly 40000 square miles of the Atlantic to save a species of whale with just 500 individuals left In Europe killer whales have dangerously high levels of illegal chemicals in their blubber Scientists are still trying to nd out if pollutants caused the deaths of ve whales that were found on beaches on the east coast of Britain in January 2016 And around the coast of Australia whales are in danger from oil and gas drilling as well as Japans recent decision to start whaling again in the seas of Antarctica,Noise from ships may disturb animals such as killer whales and dolphins much more than people previously thought New research shows that underwater noise could disturb the animals communication and ability to nd prey The low rumble of passing ships has for a long time been connected to the disturbance of large whales But US researchers have also found noise at medium and higher frequencies including at 20000Hz where killer whales also known as orcas hear best These noises could be disturbing the ability of killer whales to communicate and use echo to nd their prey Dolphins and porpoises which also hear at higher frequencies may have the same problems The ndings suggest that the noise could affect the endangered population of killer whales that are found near the shipping lanes up the west coast of the USA The main concern of this is that even a slight increase in sound may make echolocation more dif cult for whales said Scott Veirs who led the research Echolocation is the process of using sound to bounce off objects such as prey and identify where they are Thats worrying because their prey chinook salmon is already quite scarce Hearing a salmons click is probably one of the most challenging things a killer whale does Hearing that subtle click is harder if theres a lot of noise around you The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise created by about 1600 ships as they passed through Haro Strait in Washington State USA The twoyear study recorded the sound made by 12 different types of vessel including cruise ships container ships and military vehicles that passed through the strait about 20 times a day Some ships are quieter than others but the average intensity of noise next to all the ships was 173 underwater decibels equivalent to 111 decibels through the air about the sound of a loud rock concert Whales are not usually right next to ships and so would hear noise of about 60 to 90 decibels around the level of a lawnmower or a vacuum cleaner Veirs said scientists already knew about the impact of underwater noise on large whales But the new research shows the threat to smaller whales dolphins and porpoises Ships have been thought of as lowfrequency sources of noise like the rumbling of lorries or trains he said Most noise is at that low frequency but the background noise of the ocean is raised even in the high frequencies This could be causing a signi cant problem that we need to look into more There are several further consequences of a noisy underwater environment Whales may have to group together more closely in order to hear each other And if they fail to nd prey as effectively they will need to use up their stores of extra blubber This is a problem because this blubber often contains manmade pollutants that are toxic to whales if they are released fully into their systems Veirs said more work needs to be done to identify how badly the noise is affecting whales and also to quieten the ships that pass near them It should be easy to reduce noise pollution he said Military ships are quite a bit quieter and there could be simple ways of transferring that technology to commercial ships Another way to reduce noise is to slow down Decreasing speed by six knots could decrease noise by half While some whale species such as blue whales the largest mammal on Earth are safer now because whaling has declined others are still under threat from a range of factors The US federal government has recently protected nearly 40000 square miles of the Atlantic to try to avoid losing a species of whale with just 500 individuals left In Europe killer whales are carrying dangerously high levels of banned chemicals in their blubber Scientists are still trying to nd out whether pollutants caused the deaths of ve whales that were found on beaches on the east coast of Britain in January 2016 Meanwhile around the coast of Australia whales face an increased threat from ship

115,More than one million British workers might be employed on zerohours contracts This number comes from a poll of more than 1000 employers by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development CIPD Recently some UK organizations from shops to Buckingham Palace have been criticized for employing staff without a guarantee of work and pay each week Employees on zerohours contracts often get no holiday or sick pay and have to ask permission before looking for extra work with another company The CIPD found that 38 of zerohours contract workers describe themselves as employed fulltime They say they typically work 30 hours or more a week Onethird of voluntary sector employers use the contracts and one in four public sector organizations The retail company Sports Direct employs around 20000 of its 23000 staff on zerohours contracts Other companies using the contracts include cinema chain Cineworld and Buckingham Palace which uses the contracts for its 350 summer workers Pub group J D Wetherspoon has 24000 of its staff 80 of its workforce on zerohours contracts Vidhya Alakeson from the Resolution Foundation said If its true that there are around one million people on zerohours contracts then that would be a big part of the workforce Unions say that employers put pressure on staff to sign the contracts In this way the employers can avoid their responsibilities to employees and reduce staff bene ts Dave Prentis of the trade union Unison said The majority of workers are only on these contracts because they have no choice Workers on zerohours contracts are often only told how many hours they will work when weekly or monthly rotas are created But they have to be available for extra work at short notice They may get holiday pay but they do not get sick pay The charity National Trust which employs many of its seasonal workers on zerohours contracts said it gives the same pay and bene ts to workers on zerohours contracts as to fulltime staff We believe zerohours contracts are essential in our organization because we are very weatherdependent the National Trust said Its important to be able to reorganize staff rotas quickly to respond to the weather and zerohours contracts allow us to do this Politician Chuka Umunna said While some employees welcome the exibility of zerohours contracts for many zerohours contracts leave them insecure and unsure of when work will come he said The poll shows that 17 of employers in the private sector use zerohours contracts lower than the 34 of organizations in the voluntary sector and 24 in the public sector Industries where employers were most likely to have at least one person on a zerohours contract were hotels catering and leisure 48 education 35 and healthcare 27,More than one million British workers might be employed on zerohours contracts a new poll shows This suggests that British businesses are using the controversial employment contracts far more than previously thought After the results which come from a poll of more than 1000 employers by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development CIPD people began asking the government to launch a full inquiry into the use of the contracts Recently many organizations from retail chains to Buckingham Palace have been criticized for hiring staff but offering no guarantee of work and pay each week Employees on zerohours contracts often get no holiday or sick pay and have to ask permission before looking for additional work elsewhere The CIPD found that 38 of zerohours contract workers describe themselves as employed fulltime typically working 30 hours or more a week Onethird of voluntary sector employers use the contracts and one in four public sector organizations Peter Cheese from the CIPD said There does need to be a closer look at what is meant by a zerohours contract And this needs to consider both the advantages and disadvantages for businesses and employees Retailer Sports Direct recently became the focus of controversy on zerohours when it was reported that the company employs around 20000 of its 23000 staff on the contracts The retailers use of the contracts was followed by details of many other companies using the contracts including cinema chain Cineworld and Buckingham Palace which uses them for its 350 summer workers Pub group J D Wetherspoon has 24000 of its staff 80 of its workforce on zerohours contracts Vidhya Alakeson from the Resolution Foundation added If its true that there are around one million people on zerohours contracts then that would be a substantial portion of the workforce this could no longer be dismissed as an issue affecting only a tiny minority Unions and poverty campaign groups have accused employers of pressuring staff into signing the contracts so that they can avoid their responsibilities and reduce staff bene ts Dave Prentis of the trade union Unison said The vast majority of workers are only on these contracts because they have no choice They may give exibility to a few but the contracts favour the employers and make it hard for workers to complain Workers on zerohours contracts are often only told how many hours they will work when weekly or monthly rotas are created but are expected to be on call for extra work at short notice They should get holiday pay but they do not get sick pay The charity National Trust which employs many of its seasonal workers on zerohours contracts said it offered the same pay and bene ts to those workers pro rata as fulltime staff but needed some workers to be on more exible contracts We believe zerohours contracts are essential in our organization as we are very weatherdependent a spokeswoman said Its important to be able to reorganize staff rotas quickly to respond to the weather and zerohours contracts allow us to do this Politician Chuka Umunna said the contracts should be the exception to the rule While some employees welcome the exibility of such contracts for many zerohours contracts leave them insecure and unsure of when work will come he said Some people have argued that the exibility of zerohours contracts may have allowed the UK to avoid higher levels of unemployment during the economic crisis Figures from the poll suggest that 17 of employers in the private sector use zerohours contracts considerably lower than the 34 of organizations in the voluntary sector and 24 in the public sector Industries where employers were most likely to have at least one person on a zerohours contract were hotels catering and leisure 48 education 35 and healthcare 27,train,ELE,INT
27,It was a beautiful summer evening and I decided to go for a swim from Doolin Pier in County Clare Ireland where I moved in 2012 There was a woman in the water with Dusty a dolphin who has a great relationship with a group of people she regularly swims with Dusty arrived in Doolin in about 2008 Hundreds of people have swum with her so everyone thinks that shes totally tame That evening the woman was tickling Dustys tummy and it looked so nice in the water There were about 20 tourists and locals on the pier They were looking at this lovely sight Just after I got into the water Dusty left the woman she was with and went crazy I found out afterwards that shes very territorial when she is with somebody Her tail was flapping wildly and at first I thought it was a display but then I realized she was angry I knew I had to get out of the water so I swam towards the pier But within seconds Dusty crashed into me with her nose It was very powerful and painful and the speed was amazing All the people on the pier were staring at me with their mouths open Dusty was still in the water beside me her tail flapping crazily That was the most frightening thing I thought if she hits me with her tail I could go under the water and drown I was at the pier but I couldnt get out because of my injuries I was terrified I shouted for help and a man put his arm in and pulled me out of the water Then another man appeared and said he was a doctor I was so cold and very worried I didnt know how bad my injuries were and my biggest fear was internal bleeding The doctor said he didnt think I had internal bleeding but he thought I probably had broken bones I found out later that I had six spinal fractures three broken ribs and a damaged lung I was in hospital for five days and I couldnt work for five months I couldnt move normally and I was in pain Then doctors told me I had posttraumatic stress My neardeath experience made me anxious about everything I felt that people were looking at me in the wrong way I began to have problems with loud noises and I suffered from memory loss I could no longer work It was the hardest year ever but now things are better I had therapy osteopathy and massage I work as an osteopath now I understand how the patients feel because I have been a patient myself I am grateful that I am healthy I really want to prevent other people being injured We think dolphins are lovely and we have faith in them who would think a dolphin would ever attack a person If you see a dangerous animal coming towards you with big teeth its scary but dolphins have this lovely wide smile I dont have any anger towards Dusty I respect her But I was in her territory and shes a wild unpredictable animal People need to know that So many people come here to swim with her and they dont understand how dangerous it can be Several other people were injured that summer After the man pulled me out of the water Dusty swam away but then she came back and looked at me Our eyes met and I felt she was sorry for what she did to me She was a totally different dolphin the anger was gone The people on the pier were amazed When she had that little moment with me that was the end of the terror I forgave her,It was a beautiful summer evening and I decided to go for a swim off Doolin Pier in County Clare Ireland where I moved in 2012 There was a woman in the water with Dusty a

shes totally tame That evening the woman was tickling Dustys tummy and it just looked so inviting There were about 20 tourists and locals on the pier looking at this lovely spectacle Just after I got into the water Dusty left the woman she was with and went crazy I found out afterwards that shes very territorial when she is with somebody Her tail was flapping wildly and at first I thought it was a display but then I realized she was angry I knew I had to get out of the water so I swam towards the pier but within seconds Dusty had crashed into me with her snout It was very powerful and painful and the speed was amazing I was pushed forwards violently All the people on the pier were staring down at me openmouthed Dusty was still in the water beside me her tail flapping crazily That was more frightening than anything I thought if she hits me with her tail I could go under and drown I was at the pier but couldnt get out because of my injuries I felt pure terror I shouted for help and a guy put his arm in and pulled me out on to the steps Then another man appeared and said he was an orthopaedic surgeon He had been driving into Doolin when he saw what was happening on the pier I was so cold and very worried I didnt know how bad my injuries were and my biggest fear was internal bleeding He checked me over and said he couldnt feel any evidence of bleeding but that I probably had broken bones I found out later that I had six spinal fractures three broken ribs and a damaged lung I was in hospital for five days and off work for five months with limited mobility and pain Then I was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress My neardeath experience had left me anxious about everything I felt that people were looking at me in the wrong way I began to struggle with loud noises and I suffered from memory loss Three months before the accident I had opened a healthfood shop but I had to let it go because I could no longer work It was the hardest year ever but now its all behind me I had therapy osteopathy and massage and am building up my own osteopathy practice now I have a new empathy with patients because I have been one I am grateful that I am healthy and I really want to prevent other people being injured We have this lovely idea about dolphins and have faith in them who would think a dolphin would ever attack a person If you see a fierce animal coming towards you with its teeth bared its scary but dolphins have this lovely wide smile I dont have any anger towards Dusty I respect her But I was in her territory and shes a wild unpredictable animal People need to

171,I got a degree in Spanish and this helped me get my fi rst job as a journalist with an international press agency in Mexico City But the degree didnt stop me from making mistakes I arrived in the Mexican capital after a bus journey all the way from New York In my new job I spent my days on the streets in political rallies and my nights alone in the offi ce where I coordinated the news from areas of fi ghting in El Salvador Nicaragua Guatemala and the rest of Central America But I also had to report on disasters fi res fl oods and explosions at fi rework factories While I was working as a reporter I found out that I was bad at understanding numbers in Spanish Once when I wanted to phone the police I got a Mexican grandmother out of bed at 2am because I had misunderstood a phone number Even worse there were too many victims in my stories 83 dead in a fi re at 6pm become 38 dead by 7pm 12 people injured in a coach crash soon became two and so it went on Finally I got a call from the main offi ce in Washington I dont know what training you have had an editor shouted but has no one ever told you a death toll cant go down Why are numbers in another language such a problem Perhaps it is because of different numbering systems In German for example 230pm is halb drei half of three and 21 is einundzwanzig one and twenty Different number systems can clearly cause confusion Some experts believe there is a link between dyscalculia the diffi culty in understanding arithmetic and problems learning foreign languages particularly if you learn languages by rote But some students who fi nd it hard to learn languages with a grammar textbook may learn more easily in a foreign country where learning is more natural In my case I have always found languages quite easy apart from the numbers But perhaps its also because we often hear numbers in a nonnative language out of context You may stop listening to the foreign language and suddenly be unable to understand I talked to multilingual friends and they said that they are fl uent in French or Italian when ordering from a restaurant menu for example but freeze if they have to say numbers especially over the phone Numbers seem to be diffi cult but no one could say why In my case my problems with numbers in a foreign language followed me from Mexico to other countries and from Spanish to German and Portuguese But in that fi rst journalism job getting the numbers wrong didnt always mean failure One night a Mexican colleague told me that a gunman was holding the American consul hostage in his offi ce in the port city of Veracruz There was no senior Englishspeaking reporter in the offi ce so they asked me to try to call the consulate I got the phone number wrong and I was put through to another phone somewhere else in the building I knew straight away who the person was I talked for 15 minutes to the gunman He didnt put away his gun as a result of his conversation with me but my reputation

streets in political rallies and nights were spent alone in the offi ce coordinating the news from areas of fi ghting in El Salvador Nicaragua Guatemala and the rest of Central America But I also had to report on occasional disasters fi res fl oods and explosions at firework factories It was as a reporter that I soon found out that I was as bad at understanding numbers in Spanish as I was at calculating them in English Once when I meant to call the police I got a Mexican grandmother out of bed at 2am because I had misunderstood a number and dialled a wrong digit Even worse there were too many victims in my stories almost 83 dead in a fi re at 6pm turned out to be as few as 38 by 7pm 12 people injured in a coach crash soon became two and so it went on Finally I got a call from the main offi ce in Washington I dont know what training you have had an editor shouted but has no one ever told you a death toll cant go down Why are numbers in another language such a problem It may be because of different numbering systems In German for example which belongs to the same IndoEuropean language family as English 230pm becomes halb drei half of three and 21 becomes einundzwanzig one and twenty Different number systems can clearly cause confusion Some experts believe there is a link between dyscalculia the diffi culty in understanding arithmetic and problems learning foreign languages particularly if languages are learnt by rote But some students who struggle to learn languages with a grammar textbook may thrive in a foreignlanguage setting where learning is more natural and less reliant on sequences of adjectives prepositions and so on In my case I have always found languages quite easy apart from the numbers But perhaps its also because you often hear numbers in a nonnative language out of context or in isolation The listener might have switched off from the foreign language and be unable to suddenly tune in I talked to multilingual friends and found that many can be fl uent in French or Italian when ordering from a restaurant menu for example but freeze if they have to communicate numbers especially over the phone Numbers seem to be taxing but no one could

88,A new report says that almost one billion people will remain in extreme poverty by 2030 if countries dont try to solve the social economic and cultural problems that keep them poor The report by the Chronic Poverty Advisory Network says that many people may rise above the poverty line of 125 a day but fall back again when they have problems such as drought or illness and insecurity or con ict The report found that in parts of rural Kenya and in South Africa 30 to 40 of people who escaped from poverty fell back again This percentage rose to 60 in some areas of Ethiopia between 1999 and 2009 Even in successful countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam the proportion was 20 Individual examples show how easy it is for people to fall back into poverty Amin is from a village in Bangladesh His income has fallen slowly because of his illness and his wifes illness the cost of his sons marriage the death of his father and loss of goods such as shing nets Lovemore from Zimbabwe is now one of the poorest people in his village He recently lost his job because of ill health and has to look after his ve grandchildren after the death of his daughters We need to make sure that people who come out of poverty remain above the poverty line permanently Too many families return to poverty when they have personal or bigger problems Governments shouldnt assume that just because somebodys income hits 125 that means the problem is solved said Andrew Shepherd the main author of the report According to the UN the goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030 is still possible But the report says that countries need to make changes to achieve zero poverty There was a drop in extreme poverty from 19 billion in 1990 to 12 billion in 2010 but the report says that progress in the next 15 years will be much more dif cult There has been a lot of progress in China but there will probably not be similar progress in other parts of the world The report says countries should try to help the chronically poor those who are poor for many years or their entire lives and stop people becoming poor Governments have been quite good at moving people over the poverty line because that is quite easy But they have avoided the more dif cult job of trying to reduce chronic poverty said Shepherd The report says progress on poverty reduction has helped people who were already closer to the poverty line but has helped the chronically poor much less It will not be possible to get to zero poverty if development policies dont focus on the chronically poor it adds The report suggests three ideas They all cost a lot of money The rst is social help to bring the poorest people closer to a goodenough standard of living The second is education from early childhood to the start of work so people can escape and stay out of poverty The third is economic growth policies that make sure that the bene ts of increasing national wealth reach the poorest people All this will cost money and the report says higher taxes will be necessary Aid will also be necessary for the startup costs for social assistance healthcare for everyone and to nance education There remains a huge role for aid in the next 20 years as many developing countries spend less than 500 on each of their citizens a year Even Nigeria with its oil wealth spends only 650 per person Shepherd said The authors say governments should have a national development plan and make sure the poorest people are represented politically as well as trying to stop dif cult social customs such as dowries and witchcraft that make extreme poverty worse,A new report has warned that up to a billion people will remain in extreme poverty by 2030 unless countries confront the social economic and cultural forces that keep them in poverty The report by the Chronic Poverty Advisory Network says that many people may rise above the poverty line of 125 a day but slip back again when they experience problems such as drought or illness and insecurity or con ict The report found that in parts of rural Kenya and in South Africa 30 to 40 of people who escaped from poverty fell back again rising to 60 in some areas of Ethiopia between 1999 and 2009 Even in successful countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam the proportion was 20 Individual examples show how easy it is for people to slip back into poverty Amin from rural Bangladesh has seen his livelihood gradually decline due to his own and his wifes illnesses the cost of his sons marriage the death of his father and loss of goods such as shing nets Lovemore from Zimbabwe has become one of the poorest people in his village He recently lost his job due to bad health and had to take in his ve grandchildren after the death of his daughters We need to ensure that people who are lifted out of poverty remain above the poverty line permanently Too many families are slipping back into poverty because they struggle to recover from personal or bigger setbacks Governments shouldnt assume that just because somebodys income reaches 125 that means job done said Andrew Shepherd lead author of the report A UN highlevel panel said it was possible to achieve the goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030 The report however argues that more of the same will not get to zero Despite a drop in extreme poverty from 19bn in 1990 to 12bn in 2010 the report says that progress in the next 15 years will be much harder The big gains in China are unlikely to be matched by similar progress elsewhere while climaterelated shocks and deep poverty in parts of subSaharan Africa will slow down progress The report says the focus should be on the chronically poor those who are poor for many years or their entire lives and on stopping the descent into poverty Governments have been quite good at moving people over the poverty line because that is relatively easy But they have shied away from the more dif cult job of trying to solve chronic poverty said Shepherd The report says progress on poverty reduction has had less of an impact on the chronically poor than on those who were already closer to the poverty line It will not be possible to get to zero unless development policies focus on the chronically poor it adds The report suggests three policies all of which require massive global investment The rst is social assistance to bring the poorest people closer to a decent standard of living The second is education from early childhood to the start of work to enable people to escape and stay out of poverty The third is economic growth policies that ensure that the bene ts of increasing national prosperity reach the very poorest people All this will cost money and the report says one obvious implication is that countries will need greater tax revenues Aid will also be needed for the startup costs for social assistance universal health coverage and to nance education including scholarships for the poorest children There remains a huge role for aid in the next 20 years as many developing countries spend less than 500 on each of their citizens a year Even Nigeria with its oil wealth spends only 650 per person Shepherd said With the current crises in Syria South Sudan and the Central African Republic the report says it is essential that governments try to reduce the risk of con ict and to create peace The report also argues that if the inequalities which affect the poorest people such as access to land labour markets and the power relationships between men and women are addressed this would tackle two goals at the same time reducing chronic poverty and inequality The authors urge governments to develop an inclusive national development plan and to work with civil society to ensure that the poorest people are represented politically as well as trying to stop dif cult social norms such as dowries and witchcraft that contribute to extreme poverty This often means challenging parts of the status quo,train,ELE,INT
89,Mountain climber Kenton Cool has just flown down from Everest base camp to Kathmandu the capital of Nepal Cool is talking about the three amazing climbs he completed the previous weekend Early on Saturday morning he reached the summit of Nuptse the first of the three main summits in the Everest horseshoe Later that day he climbed to the summit of Everest and reached the top in complete darkness early on Sunday He then continued to the summit of Lhotse the third of the three peaks on Monday morning He says he took advantage of a rare opportunity For the first time since the late 1990s there were fixed ropes on all three mountains What I did was still a great physical achievement But the person who does it next will do it without ropes or bottled oxygen asked Cool to look forward and imagine what top climbers might do 60 years from now I hate to think he says but he mentions the Swiss climber Ueli Steck who fled the mountain in April after an argument with a group of Sherpas Steck was planning to climb Everests west ridge and then immediately climb Lhotse via a new route without fixed ropes Ueli trained like a machine Cool says Hes a fantastic climber It would have been amazing What will tourism look like in the Everest region in the future One clue is in the amazing helicopter rescue by Simone Moro Stecks climbing partner Moro flew back to Everest on Tuesday in a powerful helicopter to rescue a climber at 7800 metres It was the highest rescue ever on Everest and highlights the increase in helicopter flights in recent years By 2073 there might be a helipad on the mountain that would bring tourists At the moment they use helicopters to rescue both climbers and trekkers who walk to Everest base camp Mountain geographer and environmentalist Alton Byers thinks it is not certain that Everest can take more tourists The combination of climate change and tourism he says is putting new pressure on the area Glaciers in the Everest region are getting smaller and even disappearing and this is having a big effect already Everywhere you go people are talking about how theres less water Theres less water for agriculture and less water for all the new lodges that they are building they are building a new pipeline to bring water for the tourists The local stream is contaminated with human waste and does not provide enough water for a place that is full of tourists Every village is digging a pit for garbage Khumbu has the highest landfill sites in the world he says Human waste is now taken away in plastic barrels but then according to Byers these barrels are emptied into a huge pit down the valley it could contaminate the regions streams and rivers We can solve these problems but we need to be serious about it he says One climber can spend 85000 to climb Everest And thats fine But were going to have to look at these other problems For half a million dollars a year you could solve most of them Climate change is another problem Weather patterns are changing and this is also having an effect on tourism Cloudy weather is closing Lukla Airport the entrance to the Everest region more often They are building a new road for 4x4s to Lukla to make sure tourists and their money can reach Everest But Byers is worried that these new roads which they are building very quickly could cause soil erosion and landslides He says that Everest is the perfect place to study some of these problems like the effects of climate change and tourism,Kenton Cool can hardly speak All the physical effort at high altitude has affected his voice He is now in Kathmandu the capital of Nepal he flew down from Everest base camp that morning Cool is talking about a startling sequence of climbs completed the previous weekend Early on Saturday morning he reached the summit of Nuptse the first and lowest of the three main summits in the Everest horseshoe that surrounds the glaciated valley called the Western Cwm That same day he climbed up to the summit of Everest itself reaching the top in complete darkness early on Sunday He and his climbing partner then continued on to the summit of Lhotse the third of this spectacular threepeaks challenge on Monday morning He says he took advantage of a rare opportunity For the first time since the late 1990s there were fixed ropes on all three mountains he says That doesnt take away the physical achievement of what I did Ive set the bar at a certain level But whoever comes along next will move the bar further and do it without ropes or bottled oxygen Sixty years after Everest was first climbed many of the media reports are looking back to Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay and their age of innocence from the modern era of commercialism and environmental damage Ive asked Cool to look forward and imagine what top climbers might be doing 60 years from now I hate to think he says but mentions the Swiss climber Ueli Steck who fled the mountain in April after an argument with a crowd of Sherpas at Camp 2 Steck he says was planning to climb Everests west ridge first done in 1963 descend to the South Col and then immediately climb Lhotse via a new route all without fixed ropes Ueli had been training like a machine Cool says Hes a fantastic climber Hes technically brilliant but he had also taken his physical condition to the highest possible level It would have been amazing to see what he could have done What will tourism look like in the Everest region in the future One clue is in the stunning helicopter rescue by Simone Moro Stecks climbing partner whose rude language caused the argument at Camp 2 Moro flew back to Everest on Tuesday at the controls of a highpowered helicopter to rescue a climber at an altitude of 7800 metres It was the highest rescue ever performed on Everest and highlights the huge rise in helicopter flights in recent years By 2073 the infrastructure on the mountain might include a helipad on the South Col that would bring tourists In the meantime helicopters are making it easier to rescue both climbers and the far more numerous trekkers who go as far as base camp It is not certain that the Everest region can continue to cope with a booming tourism sector according to mountain geographer and environmentalist Alton Byers The combination of climate change and tourism he says is creating new stresses on the Sherpa homeland The retreat and in some cases disappearance of glaciers in the Everest region is having a major impact already Everywhere you go people are talking about how theres less water Theres less water for agriculture and less water for all the new lodges that are getting built In the Sherpa town of Namche Bazaar he says a new fivemile pipeline is being laid to bring water to service the growing tourist demand for showers and flush toilets The local stream has become contaminated with human waste and does not provide enough water for a place that in high season is bursting at the seams Every village is digging a pit just beyond the houses for garbage Khumbu has the highest landfill sites in the world he says Human waste at base camp is now managed well and removed in plastic barrels But according to Byers these barrels are emptied into a huge pit a few hours down the valley that could leak into the regions watercourses These problems can be solved but we need to get serious about it he says One climber can spend 85000 climbing Everest And thats fine But at some point were going to have to look at these other priorities For half a million dollars a year you could solve most of them Climate change is another issue Byers works with local conservation committees to identify and plan for the impacts of climate change most usually finding new water sources or introducing rainwater harvesting The rapid buildup of glacial lakes is a constant threat they threaten to burst and flood the Sherpa homeland At some point in the future people are going to have to get out of their way Changing weather patterns are also having an impact on tourism Increased cloud cover in periods of normally clear weather is closing Lukla Airport the gateway to the Everest region more often A new road for 4x4s is being built to Lukla to guarantee the flow of tourists and their money but Byers is worried that the rapid spread of the road network in Nepal is being done too cheaply with disastrous consequences in terms of soil erosion and landslides Everest is the icon everyone knows he says Its the perfect laboratory for figuring out how to solve some of these problems like the impacts of climate change and tourism,train,ELE,INT
132,An international agreement to improve safety in Bangladeshs clothes factories could face legal action This is because factory owners are asking for compensation for the cost of closures and repair work Some repairs may take months and factory owners say they cannot pay workers while factories are closed Also they cannot pay for big works to make buildings safe The building repairs are happening after the Rana Plaza building in the capital of Bangladesh Dhaka collapsed in 2013 and 1138 people died The problems come as hundreds of Bangladeshi clothes factories are inspected every month for firesafety and structural problems under the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh The Accord is supported by over 170 international companies including Primark and Marks Spencer and international trade unions including IndustriALL The owner of one Dhaka factory Softex Cotton said he will take legal action against the Accord because his factory was closed down as a result of structural problems He wants around 100 million in compensation Another factory owner said that when a factory closed even for a few months it would lose orders and close permanently There is no such thing as temporary closure he said The factory owner said it was not clear in the Accord agreement who would pay for factory closures Jenny Holdcroft policy director for IndustriALL which has been closely involved in the Accord said that the agreement made sure that factories would not lose orders during closure because companies agreed to continue orders with suppliers for two years The Accord has found12 factories that need a lot of work but Holdcroft said many of those only needed partial closure and production could continue on other floors The Accord also asks companies to make sure that workers receive pay during factory closures She said that factory owners who could afford to pay for repairs and compensation for workers should make the payments Companies dont want to pay so that rich factory owners can continue to just take the profits and not spend on their factories for years It is not surprising that there is disruption If there was no disruption there would be no change she said A spokesman for the Accord said negotiations over payments and even legal action would not delay its work to improve safety in factories But there is now more pressure on the Accord to help pay workers when their factories close A rival factorysafety group supported by US retailers including Walmart and Gap the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety has given 5 million to help pay factory workers for up to two months while buildings are improved The Alliance is sharing the workers salary with factory owners so now there is a big confusion We had a big meeting with the Accord to make them understand they have to help or how will we help our workers said Shaidullah Azim a director of the Bangladeshi Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association,An international agreement to improve safety in Bangladeshs clothing factories could face legal action because factory owners are demanding compensation for the cost of closures and repair work Some repair programmes are expected to take months and factory owners say they cannot pay staff while factories are closed as well as paying for major works needed to ensure that buildings are safe The building repairs are happening in the wake of the collapse of the Rana Plaza complex in the capital of Bangladesh Dhaka in 2013 in which 1138 people were killed The problems come as hundreds of Bangladeshi clothing factories per month are inspected for firesafety and structural problems under the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh which is supported by over 170 international brands including Primark and Marks Spencer and international trade unions including IndustriALL The owner of one Dhakabased factory Softex Cotton has said he will take legal action against the Accord because his factory was closed down due to structural problems He is demanding 100m in compensation Another factory owner said that once a factory closed its doors even for a few months it would lose orders and close permanently There is no such thing as temporary closure he said The factory owner said that the Accord agreement had pussyfooted around the issue of who paid for factory closures because they just wanted to get as many brands as possible to sign up to a deal in the wake of the Rana Plaza disaster He said there was no clear process in place to pay the costs involved Jenny Holdcroft policy director for IndustriALL which has been closely involved in the Accord said that the agreement ensured that factories would not lose orders during closure because brands had committed to maintain orders with suppliers for two years Twelve factories have been identified by the Accord as needing significant work so far but Holdcroft said many of those only needed partial closure and production could continue on other floors The Accord also legally requires brands to ensure that workers are paid during factory closures She said the detail on who would make payments had been left open in order to ensure that all those factory owners who could afford to pay for repairs and compensation for workers made the necessary payments This was always going to be a topic of negotiation Brands dont want to commit to paying so that rich factory owners who have just pocketed the profits and not been spending on their factories for years continue to do so There was obviously going to be disruption If there was no disruption there would be no change she said A spokesman for the Accord said negotiations over payments and even legal action would not hold up its work to improve safety in factories However pressure on the Accord to contribute to the payment of displaced workers has increased after a rival factorysafety group backed by US retailers including Walmart and Gap the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety set aside 5m to help pay factory workers for up to two months while buildings are improved It has so far identified five factories in four buildings where production needed to be suspended The Alliance is sharing the workers salary along with entrepreneurs so now there is a big confusion We had a big meeting with the Accord to make them understand they have to come forward or how will we help our

26,36yearold Junior Smart knows a lot about gangs When he was a teenager after his mother died he joined a south London gang At the time it helped fill a big gap in his life They became my new support group he says At first it was just a bit of fun but then it became more serious and we got involved in crime After he left college he got a fulltime job but he was also making money illegally as part of the gang Eventually he was arrested for serious drug crimes and was sent to prison for 12 years The first night after I was arrested was the biggest shock of my life he says I had been living a double life I had been living as one person to my peers and another person to my peers enemies Today Junior Smart runs a team of 12 fulltime workers and six volunteers working to help young criminals and gang members to stop committing crimes Most of the team are excriminals like Smart A few are still in prison but are allowed out during the day to help They work with the police the probation service and other voluntary organizations to help members of the violent criminal gangs of London Smarts extraordinary journey from gang member to mentor began when he was in prison I couldnt believe that people kept coming back in and nobody did anything about it I was talking to the prisoners and they knew what was wrong in their lives but the problem is that the prison system only deals with the crime One guy spent 300 a week on cocaine and burgled houses to get the money He told me how he walked into houses even when he knew people were there So he had a drug addiction but that problem was never solved Smart started working as a prison listener a prisoner who helps new arrivals during their first days inside Then he had an idea to run his own scheme when he left prison using the experience of exoffenders to help others reject crime He left prison after five years and started his scheme So what does he think now Does he believe that things are getting better He says the police have done some good work in arresting gang members But he criticizes the government because they believe that when the leader of a gang is arrested the problem is solved He believes the arrest of gang leaders can even make things worse When you arrest the leader people in the gang start fighting Who was the most loyal Who had the most respect It is a bit like a violent family It means that the arrest of the gang leaders has no longterm effect Can it make the streets more dangerous Yes it can If one gang knows that an elder leader has been arrested then they suddenly think that gangs weak And so we have fights between different gangs And what happens when that elder is in prison He makes friends with other gang members or when he comes out of prison he tries to take control back That is when violence happens Smart says gangs are now recruiting members in primary schools The youngest members are called tinies Over the last years we have seen more and more of this The tinies can be just eight to eleven years old The youngest members protect their seniors from risk They often sell drugs or even stab people he says Smart says that the challenges are very big particularly because the economy is so bad I try to help a young person who has been earning 300 a week illegally It was difficult before but with lots of unemployment its even more difficult now But his project which has more than 1000 clients is bringing results Fewer than 20 of the people he helps reoffend Smart believes that everyone should get a second chance,Junior Smart knows a lot about gangs He is now 36 and his life can be divided into two phases When he was a teenager after his mother died he joined a south London gang At the time it helped fill a big gap in his life They became my new support group he says At first it was just a bit of fun but then it became more serious more and more about making money They got involved in crime That is how it was After leaving college he got a fulltime job in administration and worked as a DJ But on the side he was making money illegally as part of the gang Eventually he was arrested for serious drug crimes and was sent to prison for 12 years The first night after I was arrested was the biggest wakeup call of my life he says I had been living a double life I had been living as one person to my peers and another person to my peers enemies I spent a long time sorting myself out Today Junior Smart runs a team of 12 fulltime workers and six volunteers which aims to turn young criminals and gang members away from crime Most of the team are excriminals like Smart A few are still in prison but they are allowed out during the day to help They work with the police the probation service and other voluntary organizations to help people who feel trapped and frightened in the violent criminal gangs of London For Smart the extraordinary journey from gang member to mentor began when he was in prison I was touched by the people who kept coming back in he says I couldnt believe that nothing was done about it I was talking to the prisoners and they knew what changes they needed in their lives but the problem is that the prison system only deals with the index offence One guy had a 300aweek cocaine habit which he paid for through burglary He told me how he would walk into a house even when he knew people were there So although he had a drug addiction that problem was never solved The thing that shocked me is that it is simply a revolving door Smart started working as a prison listener a prisoner who helps new arrivals during their first days in prison Then he developed an idea to run his own scheme when he was out of prison using the experience of exoffenders to help others reject the revolving door of prison life He was released early after five years and got the opportunity to put his idea into practice So what does he think now Does he believe that things are getting better He is careful to say positive things about the police he says much of their work in arresting gang members has been good But in general he is highly critical of a disjointed government approach that believes that once the leader of a gang is arrested the problem is solved He agrees with a report that says the arrest of gang leaders can even make things worse He says the effect of removing the leader is often to destabilize the entire gang When you arrest the top guy everyone starts fighting for position Who was the most loyal Who had the most respect It is a bit like a family They are more likely to be violent It means that the arrest of the gang leaders has been nullified because it has not had a longterm effect Can it actually make the streets more dangerous It can People take sides If one gang knows that an elder leader has been arrested then they suddenly think that gangs weak And so there are gang disputes And what happens when that elder is in prison He forms alliances with other gang members or when he is released he then tries to retake control That is when violence happens In order to spread risk down to the lowest levels he says gangs are now recruiting far more in primary schools The youngest members are called tinies Over the last years we have seen more and more of this The tinies can be just eight to eleven years old The young protect their seniors from risk They often do the street dealing or even the stabbing he says Smart says that the challenges are immense particularly with the current economic problems I try to help a young person who has been earning 300 a week through illegal methods It was hard before to try to convince him But with unemployment high and cuts to benefits it makes things more difficult However his project which has over 1000 clients is producing results Fewer than 20 of those who come in for help reoffend Smart believes that everyone deserves a second chance,train,ELE,INT
139,Cathal Redmond was swimming off the Greek coast He took some photos of colourful sh with his rst underwater camera and he was sure they would be great But when he looked at the photos later they were brown and murky The photos were bad because he was holding his breath underwater so he didnt have enough time to take the pictures He thought that all he needed was a little more time to photograph the sh in their natural environment To help with this problem he has invented the Express Dive It is a re llable air storage device which you hold in your mouth It lets you swim underwater for two minutes It is somewhere between snorkelling which is very limited and scuba diving which gives people the freedom to breathe underwater but needs heavy and expensive gear The prototype of his invention looks like a combination of a scuba mouthpiece and a water bottle I wanted to let people to do more not just get underwater and spend 30 seconds holding their breath says Redmond 27 In 2006 the Irish designer completed a scubadiving course and loved the feeling of being able to breathe underwater and watch sh in their natural environment But all the equipment he needed was less enjoyable I didnt like that I had about 50kg of equipment on me And getting into the water was quite strange when you are used to trying to stay at the surface It was a very surreal experience he says The real problem is that scuba diving limits what you can do It allows you to stay underwater for longer but it takes a lot of planning You have 20kg to 50kg of gear with you you cant just walk on the beach and decide you want to go in Planning is a very big part of it It was during a nalyear project for his degree that Redmond produced the Express Dive The device has two main parts When above the surface the device takes in air through a vent in the mouthpiece The air is compressed and stored in a tank which has a light that ashes green when it is full When it has nished taking in air the vent closes and when the person dives air is fed back through the mouthpiece The light turns from green to red when the air starts to runs out The device can take in enough air for two minutes of diving and takes approximately the same amount of time to re ll Redmond says the mouthpiece feels similar to a snorkel They have tested the prototype in parts Redmond says he has shown that the motor can compress two minutes of air into the device and that a person can hold the device in their mouth What he has not yet done is test the device on a diver completely underwater for two minutes But with enough testing Redmond is sure the device will work well and that it will not be dangerous for swimmers underwater The device will probably cost 280 he says and it will probably weigh from 1kg to 3kg Perhaps some people think two minutes of air is not enough and is not much better than snorkelling But Redmond says two minutes can make all the difference underwater The typical swimmer can hold their breath for about 40 seconds while underwater Two minutes is not a lot of time but it is a lot longer than that he says,Cathal Redmond was swimming off the Greek coast and he was sure he had taken some great photos of colourful sh with his rst underwater camera But when he looked at the results later the photos were brown and murky He took the pictures while holding his breath underwater and blamed the limited time he had to set up the shots All he needed he thought was a little more time to photograph the sh in their natural environment He decided to invent something to make that little extra time a reality and the result is his invention of the Express Dive a re llable air storage device which is held in the mouth and lets people swim underwater for two minutes It bridges the gap between snorkelling with its limitations and scuba diving which gives divers the freedom to breathe underwater but requires heavy and expensive gear The prototype of the invention looks like a combination of a scuba mouthpiece and a water bottle I wanted to enable people to do more So rather than just go underwater and spend 30 seconds holding their breath I wanted people to do a little bit more says Redmond 27 In 2006 the Irish designer completed a scubadiving course and loved the feeling of being able to breathe underwater and observe sh in their natural environment Less enjoyable however was all the equipment he needed I was very aware of the fact that I had about 50kg of equipment on me and going under the water felt strange when you are used to trying to keep yourself at the surface It was a very surreal experience he says The real problem is that scuba diving is very limiting Although it allows you to stay underwater for longer you have to plan your whole day around it You have 20kg to 50kg of gear with you you cant be walking on the beach and decide you want to go in Planning is a very big part of it It was during a nalyear project for his product design degree that Redmond produced the Express Dive The device has two main parts When above the surface the unit sucks in air through a vent in the mouthpiece The air is compressed through valves and stored in the tank The tank has a light that ashes green when it is full When air is no longer being taken in the vent shuts off and as the person dives air is fed back via the mouthpiece The light turns from green to red when the air start to run out The device can take in enough air for two minutes of diving and takes approximately the same amount of time to re ll When you put the compressor into the unit with all of the rest of the stuff the batteries and the electronics the dif cult thing was to make it small enough so that people could hold it in their mouths Redmond says Redmond says the mouthpiece feels similar to using a snorkel He compares it to an extension of the lungs in that the user is taking a deep breath and then using it underwater It is an extension of the bodys ability to store air he says The prototype has been tested in parts Redmond says he has shown that the motor can compress two minutes worth of air into the unit and that the design can be held in the divers mouth What he has not yet done is test the device on a diver fully submerged for two minutes But with enough testing Redmond is con dent he can get a fully working device that will not endanger swimmers underwater The device will probably cost 280 he says and it is likely to weigh from 1kg to 3kg depending on the safety features needed To anyone who thinks two minutes of air is no more than a very small improvement on snorkelling Redmond says it could make a big difference underwater The typical swimmer can hold their breath for about 40 seconds while underwater he says Two minutes is not a lot of time but it is a lot longer than that he says,train,ELE,INT
144,Passing clouds One of the good things about flying is seeing clouds very close They seem to be light but they carry a lot of water around 500 tonnes in a small cloud And water is heavier than air So why dont clouds fall out of the sky like rain They do but they take a very long time An average cloud would take a year to fall one metre On cloud nine Most of us are happy to call clouds fluffy ones or nasty black ones but there are more than 50 cloud types The 50 cloud types fit into nine categories Cloud nine is the very big cumulonimbus so to be on cloud nine means that you are on top of the world or very very happy Around the rainbow The best place to see a rainbow is from a plane Rainbows are made when sunlight hits raindrops We see a bow because the Earth is in the way but from a plane a rainbow is a complete circle Mr blue sky Sunlight is white It includes all the colours of the spectrum As it passes through air some of the light is scattered Blue light scatters more than other colours so the blue looks like it comes from the sky Theres life out there We usually only see clouds and other planes from a flying aircrafts window but the air is full of bacteria 1800 different types of bacteria Turbulence terror Even someone who flies all the time can feel sick because of turbulence The good news is that no modern airliner has ever crashed because of these sudden and violent movements of air People have been hurt when they are not strapped in or falling luggage may hit them but the plane is not going to fall out of the sky You cant cure jet lag The world is divided into time zones When you take a long flight the difference between local time and your bodys time causes jet lag But jet lag can be reduced if you keep food bland for 24 hours before travel drink a lot and live on your destination time from the moment you get on the aircraft Supersonic 747s Many of us have travelled faster than sound There are many jet streams in the air around the Earth especially on the journey from the US to Europe A jet stream can move as fast as 250 miles per hour If an airliner flying at 550mph enters a jet stream the result can be that the plane flies at 800mph Thats faster than the speed of sound Flying through time Flying across time zones means that we travel through time But this time travel is so small that crossing the Atlantic every week for 40 years would only move you 11000th of a second into the future Terrible tea Dont blame the cabin attendant if your tea isnt great Water should be just under 100C when you pour it on to tea leaves but that isnt possible on a plane Its impossible to get water hotter than 90C during flight so choose coffee I cant hear my food People often say that airline food is bland and without taste But some of the problem may not be bad food A plane is a noisy place and food loses some of its taste when there are loud noises Needle in a haystack With modern technology it seems strange that Malaysian flight MH370 could disappear but finding a missing aircraft is a needleinahaystack problem The plane knows where it is but it does not send this information anywhere The problem is not technology the problem is that there is no law that says that planes must send this information Volcanic fallout Air travel can be cancelled by volcanic activity Ash melts in the heat of the engine then solidifies on the rotors It is very dangerous to ignore the volcanic ash The wing myth For many years we taught the wrong explanation for the way wings keep planes in the air But now we know that a plane stays in the air because of Newtons Third Law of Motion The shape of the wing pushes air down As the air is pushed down the wing gets an equal and opposite push up and this lifts the plane,Passing clouds One of the pleasures of flying is seeing clouds close up Even though they seem to be light they carry a lot of water around 500 tonnes in a small cloud And water is heavier than air So why dont clouds fall out of the sky like rain They do but they take a very long time An average cloud would take a year to fall one metre On cloud nine Most of us are happy to call clouds fluffy ones or nasty black ones but meteorologists identify more than 50 cloud types These fit into categories given the numbers one to nine Cloud nine is the vast tall cumulonimbus so to be on cloud nine means that you are on top of the world Around the rainbow Theres no better place to see a rainbow than from a plane Rainbows are produced when sunlight hits raindrops We see a bow because the Earth gets in the way but from a plane a rainbow is a complete circle Mr blue sky Sunlight is white containing all the colours of the spectrum but as it passes through air some of the light is scattered when it interacts with the gas molecules Blue light scatters more than the lowerenergy colours so the blue looks like it comes from the sky Theres life out there Apart from clouds and other planes we dont expect to see much directly outside a flying aircrafts window but the air is full of bacterial life as many as 1800 different types of bacteria have been detected over cities and they can reach twice the cruising height of a plane Turbulence terror Turbulence can make even the most experienced flyer turn green The violent movements of air can cause anything from repeated bumping to sudden dramatic plunges The good news for nervous flyers is that no modern airliner has ever been brought down by turbulence People have been injured and occasionally killed when they are not strapped in or get hit by falling luggage but the plane is not going to fall out of the sky Inflight radiation When body scanners were introduced at airports there were radiation scares but the level produced by the scanners is the same as passengers receive in one minute of flight The Earth is constantly hit by cosmic rays natural radiation from space that is stronger at altitude You cant cure jet lag The world is divided into time zones The result is that longhaul travel results in a difference between local time and your bodys time causing jet lag However its effects can be reduced by keeping food bland for 24 hours before travel drinking plenty of fluids and living on your destination time from the moment you reach the aircraft Supersonic 747s Many of us have travelled faster than sound There are a number of jet streams in the upper atmosphere especially on the journey from the US to Europe where a temperature inversion causes a stream of air to move as fast as 250 miles per hour If an airliner with an airspeed of 550mph enters a jet stream the result can be that it flies at 800mph faster than the speed of sound Flying through time Time zones provide an artificial journey through time but special relativity means that a flight involves actual time travel However its so minimal that crossing the Atlantic weekly for 40 years would only move you 11000th of a second into the future Terrible tea Dont blame the cabin attendant if your tea isnt great Water should be just under 100C when it is poured on to tea leaves but that isnt possible on a plane Its impossible to get water beyond 90C during

156,A new scientific study says that global warming might make temperatures rise more than people think The scientist who led the research said that if emissions of greenhouse gases are not reduced the planet will be at least 4C warmer by 2100 This is twice the level the worlds governments consider to be dangerous The research shows that fewer clouds form as the planet warms This means that less sunlight reflects back into space and this makes temperatures even higher The way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery in the study of future climate change Professor Steven Sherwood at the University of New South Wales in Australia who led the research said that their work was new in two ways First it found what controls the cloud changes and second it did not accept the lowest estimates of future global warming it believed the higher more damaging estimates 4C would be catastrophic not simply dangerous Sherwood said For example it would make life difficult if not impossible in much of the tropics and it would guarantee the eventual melting of the Greenland ice sheet and some of the Antarctic ice sheet And if the ice sheets melt sea levels will rise by many metres The research helps to show how much warming is caused by rises in carbon emissions say scientists who have commented on the study published in the journal Nature Experts at Japans National Institute for Environmental Studies said the explanation of how fewer clouds form as the world warms was a good one They also agreed that this showed future climate change would be bigger than people think To measure the effect of greenhouse gases on the Earths climate scientists estimate what the rise in temperature would be with twice as much CO2 in the atmosphere as in the preindustrial age and this will probably happen within 50 years For twenty years those estimates have been from 15C to 5C a wide range The new research has reduced that range to between 3C and 5C by studying the biggest cause of uncertainty clouds Researchers use computer climate models to predict future temperatures and it was important to include the way clouds form in those models When water evaporates from the oceans the vapour can rise over nine miles to form rain clouds that reflect sunlight or it may rise just a few miles and fall slowly back down without forming clouds In reality both things happen and climate models that include the second possibility predict much higher future temperatures than the models that only include the ninemilehigh clouds Climate sceptics like to criticize climate models because they are sometimes wrong and we know that they are not perfect said Sherwood But we are finding that the mistakes are being made by the models that predict less warming not the models that predict more warming He added Sceptics may also point to the pause in the rise of temperatures since the end of the 20th century but there is more and more evidence that we cannot see this pause in other measures of the climate system And the pause is almost certainly temporary The worlds average air temperatures have increased quite slowly since a high point in 1998 which the ocean phenomenon El Nino caused But greenhouse gases are trapping more and more heat and over 90 disappears into the oceans Also a recent study suggested that it may seem there is a pause but this is only because we did not have temperature readings from polar regions where there is the most warming Sherwood accepts that his teams work on the role of clouds does not mean for sure that temperature rises will be in the higher range He added that a 4C rise in the worlds average temperatures would have a serious effect on the world and the economies of many countries if we do not reduce emissions,According to a new scientific study temperature rises caused by uncontrolled global warming could be at the high end of current estimates The scientist who led the research said that unless emissions of greenhouse gases are reduced the planet will heat up by a minimum of 4C by 2100 This is twice the level the worlds governments consider to be dangerous The research indicates that fewer clouds form as the planet warms which means less sunlight is reflected back into space This forces temperatures up even higher The way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery in the study of future climate change Professor Steven Sherwood at the University of New South Wales in Australia who led the new work said that the study broke new ground in two ways First it identified what controls the cloud changes and second it rejected the lowest estimates of future global warming and favoured the higher and more damaging estimates 4C would be catastrophic rather than simply dangerous Sherwood said For example it would make life difficult if not impossible in much of the tropics and would guarantee the eventual melting of the Greenland ice sheet and some of the Antarctic ice sheet with sea levels rising by many metres as a result The research reduces the uncertainty about how much warming is caused by rises in carbon emissions according to scientists commenting on the study published in the journal Nature Experts at Japans National Institute for Environmental Studies said the explanation of how fewer clouds form as the world warms was convincing and agreed that this indicated future climate change would be greater than expected Scientists measure the sensitivity of the Earths climate to greenhouse gases by estimating the temperature rise that would be caused by a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere compared with preindustrial levels which is likely to happen within 50 years For two decades those estimates have run from 15C to 5C wide range The new research narrowed that range down to between 3C and 5C by closely examining the biggest cause of uncertainty clouds Computer climate models are the only tool researchers have to predict future temperatures and it was important to make sure that the way clouds are formed was represented accurately in those models When water evaporates from the oceans the vapour can rise over nine miles to form rain clouds that reflect sunlight or it may rise just a few miles and drift back down without forming clouds In reality both processes happen and climate models that included the second possibility predicted significantly higher future temperatures than models that only included the ninemilehigh clouds Climate sceptics like to criticize climate models for getting things wrong and we are the first to admit they are not perfect said Sherwood But what we are finding is that the mistakes are being made by the models that predict less warming not those that predict more He added Sceptics may also point to the hiatus of temperatures since the end of the 20th century but there is increasing evidence that this hiatus is not seen in other measures of the climate system and is almost certainly temporary Global average air temperatures have increased quite slowly since a high point in 1998 which was caused by the ocean phenomenon El Nino But observations show that heat is continuing to be trapped in increasing amounts by greenhouse gases with over 90 disappearing into the oceans Furthermore a study in November 2013 suggested the pause may be mainly an illusion a result of the lack of temperature readings from polar regions where warming is greatest Sherwood accepts his teams work on the role of clouds cannot definitely rule out that future temperature rises will be at the lower end of projections But for that to be the case there would need to be some major missing ingredient for which there is currently no evidence He added that a 4C rise in global average temperatures would have a serious impact on the world and the economies of many countries if emissions were not reduced,train,ELE,INT
74,Is this the moment when streaming goes mainstream According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry IFPI only 41 million subscribers used music streaming services around the world in 2014 In the record business it is the area that is growing the fastest but it is still quite small Also many subscribers have streaming as part of a mobile phone package so nobody knows if they use the service or not Apple hopes to reach 100 million subscribers The subscription fee would be 120 per year so Apple would earn 12 billion a year By comparison the entire global worth of recorded music in 2014 was just under 15 billion Apple is good at making products go mainstream but its not that good Is this the end of downloading The iTunes Store arrived in 2003 2004 in Europe Apple was able to persuade consumers to pay for downloads and it grew a really big business with an estimated 70 market share Downloads were still 52 of total digital income in 2014 according to IFPI Apple has most of this this means it is the biggest music retailer in the world But download earnings reached their highest point in 2013 in the UK at 283 million and fell to 249 million in 2014 Download sales fell in the US in 2013 so Apple bought Beats in 2014 because it wanted to move from music ownership downloads to music access subscription streaming Apple and the record industry cannot afford to get rid of the download market yet so streaming and downloading will have to coexist under the Apple brand Most people like music but dont love it enough to pay 120 a year to listen to it On average people in the UK for example spent just 3952 on music in 2014 Even Apple will nd it very dif cult to make people triple the money they spend on recorded music Has Apple Connect made Apple the most artistfriendly service Apple Connect is somewhere in the middle of YouTube Facebook and SoundCloud It allows artists to post music videos photos and more to their pro le pages Apple has good relations with the music industry and also with artists It has a good reputation among artists This is a bit different from Spotify artists from Radioheads Thom Yorke to Taylor Swift have criticized Spotify There is probably going to be a revolution and Apple is trying to make sure it has the support of artists Where are the artist exclusives Artist exclusives is going to be the interesting bit when Apple Music opens It will be very important for streaming to have exclusive rights to big albums Spotify paid a lot of money to get Led Zeppelin and Metallica exclusively Apple already has the music of ACDC and the Beatles for download on iTunes but it is uncertain if these two will want to move to streaming It was an easy decision for artists to give iTunes the download exclusive on an album because most people download music using iTunes But trying to do that in streaming is not the same thing Is this going to kill Spotify Some people already believe that Apple Music will destroy competitors like Spotify But its not that simple Other companies have been offering music streaming for many years but Apple hasnt it has no experience of music streaming The winner of this battle will not be the company with the best service it will be the company with the most money Apples competitors have an advantage but they are losing a lot of money Spotify for example lost 931 million in 2013 But Apple is different it started 2015 by becoming the most pro table company in business history It had 178 billion in the bank,Is this the moment when streaming goes truly mainstream According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry IFPI there were only 41m subscribers using music streaming services around the world in 2014 It might be the area with the biggest revenue growth for the record business but it is still quite small Not only that but many of those subscribers have streaming as part of a mobile phone package so it is uncertain exactly how active its users are Some sources suggest that Apple is aiming to reach 100m subscribers which based on a subscription fee of 120 per year would generate 12bn annually To put that in context the entire global worth of recorded music in 2014 was just under 15bn Apple is good at making products go mainstream but its not that good Is this the end of downloading The iTunes Store arrived in 2003 2004 in Europe at a time when piracy was widespread Apple managed to persuade consumers to pay for downloads and grew a huge business with an estimated 70 market share Downloads were still 52 of the total digital income in 2014 according to IFPI Apple holds the lions share of this it is biggest music retailer in the world But download revenue reached a peak in 2013 in the UK at 283m and fell to 249m in 2014 The decline in download sales hit the US in 2013 so Apple bought Beats in 2014 for 3bn in order to get into the premium headphone market and also to make the transition from music ownership downloads to music access subscription streaming Apple and the record industry cannot afford to get rid of the download market just yet so streaming and downloading will have to coexist under the Apple brand The vast majority of people like music but dont love it enough to pay 120 a year to listen to it The average spend of a music buyer in the UK in 2014 for example was just 3952 Even Apple will nd it very dif cult to make most of those people triple their annual spend on recorded music Has Apple Connect made Apple the most artistfriendly service Apple have previously tried to be artistfriendly via iTunes It didnt work Apple Connect is something very different somewhere in the middle of YouTube Facebook and SoundCloud It lets artists post music videos photos and more to their pro le pages Apple has generally had strong relations with the music industry and also artists themselves and generally it has a good reputation among artists Compare that to Spotify which has been criticized by artists from Radioheads Thom Yorke to Taylor Swift There is the smell of revolution in the air and Apple is making sure its on the right side of the battle Where are the artist exclusives This is going to be the interesting bit when the service goes live Getting exclusives for big albums will be crucial to streaming Spotify paid a lot of money to get Led Zeppelin and Metallica exclusively Apple was watching this carefully and making notes It already has ACDC and the Beatles catalogues for download on iTunes But can it persuade these two to enter the world of streaming It also managed to get the surprise Beyonce album in 2013 before anyone else so it is inevitable that it will want more like that It was an easy decision for artists to give iTunes the download exclusive on an album because iTunes controls so much of the download market But trying to do that in streaming is not the same thing It is also important to remember that streaming now counts towards the album chart in markets like the UK and US and artists who still want to succeed in the charts will not want to limit their audience by limiting themselves to one service Is this going to kill Spotify Some people are already saying that Apple Music will destroy rivals like Spotify However its not that simple Apple is entering a market where others have been working and gaining experience for many years It has a lot of catching up to do The winner of this battle will not be the company with the best service it will be the company with the most money Apples competitors have a head start in the market but they are losing huge amounts of money Spotify for example lost 931m in 2013 Apple on the other hand started 2015 by becoming the most pro table company in corporate history with 178bn in the bank If Apple Music loses Apple money the company will not continue it for long but it will not stop investment without at least trying to beat the competition,train,ELE,INT
5,Introduction Did you know that in the UK there is no law that says restaurants have to pass on tips to staff A new government report asked workers employers and customers what they thought about tipping After reading the report the UK government says it wants to change the rules to make sure that lowpaid workers get the tips that customers leave for them The report said that some waiters are made to pay a 15 administration fee on tips that customers pay by credit or debit card The government said that it wants customers to know that tips are voluntary They want the tipping process to be made clearer so that everyone can understand it We asked waiters around the UK what they think of tipping including how much money they get from tips and if its fair 1 Rodri 37 London Around 50 of a waiters income is tips Average tips 60 per eighthour shift I think they treat waiters best in the US Everything has got fairer since the tipping scandal in the summer of 2015 This is when lots of restaurants were taking money from tips for administration fees But you still hear horror stories from new employees at some chains I get about 60 in tips per shift On a good night this goes up to over 100 and on a poor night its around 40 Around 50 of a waiters income is tips All restaurants should have to tell customers what they do with tips American waiters are lucky everyone tips in America 2 Elle 22 Edinburgh We never know whether its fair Average tips 20 per eighthour shift I think they treat waiters best in France I have three parttime jobs My day job is in a cafe where the staff work both in the cafe and in the kitchen so all our tips go in a pot and we all get the same My evening job is at a restaurant where we dont get our tips but we get the minimum wage plus an extra 250 per hour My third job is events catering and nobody ever tips In restaurants because a lot of customers add tips by card the staff never see how much the tip is so we dont know if what we get is fair or not The system seems better in France where they dont tip much but being a waiter is seen as a proper job with job security and good wages 3 Ashley 22 London Tips go towards customer breakages Average tips 1015 per eighthour shift I think they treat waiters best in Australia I work in a London pub in the evenings and I do day shifts at a local restaurant In both places all the tips are collected and shared out at the end of the night Money is taken from the tips to pay for breakages by staff and customers It is very unfair that our tips are shared out especially when one member of the team doesnt work hard enough Its really unfair that money from our tips is taken for breakages by customers The managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without taking our tips I make around 20 a shift in tips but often I only get 1015 of that money I really need tips because I am only paid 7 an hour Id prefer to get a good basic wage like in Australia and not have to rely on tips 4 Tom Manchester A big night of tips can help pay the rent Average tips 40 per eighthour shift I think they treat waiters best in Italy Where I used to work waiters kept 80 of cash tips and 40 of card tips The rest went to the other staff in the restaurant Its hard to say how much I earn in a shift maybe about 40 It can make a big difference Sometimes waiters need a good night to be able to pay their rent They have got tipping right in Italy where customers dont add a big tip but usually round up their bill so if their meal is 19 they leave a 20 note and dont ask for change,Introduction Did you know that in the UK there is no legal requirement for restaurants to pass on tips to staff For a new government report workers employers and customers were asked about their views on tipping After reading the report government ministers said they wanted to change the rules and make sure lowpaid workers get the money left for them by happy customers The report said that some waiters are charged up to a 15 administration fee on tips that are left when customers pay by credit or debit cards The government said it would consider not allowing employers to charge workers an administration fee The government also said that it wanted customers to know that tips are voluntary and they want the system to be more transparent with restaurants clearly displaying their tips policy We asked waiters around the UK what they think of the tipping process including how much they take home from tips and whether its fair and what would improve it for them 1 Rodri 37 London Around 50 of a waiters income is tips Average tips 60 per eighthour shift I think they treat waiters best in the US Everything has got fairer since the tipping scandal was exposed in the summer of 2015 This is when dozens of restaurants were exposed for taking money from tips for administration fees However you still hear horror stories from new employees at some chains Some restaurants take 4 of all sales to pay the chefs and as an admin fee It doesnt matter how much you make in tips This means that if a table has a 100 bill and doesnt tip the waiter has to pay 4 of their own money This leads to bad service If a table doesnt tip the waiter feels as if the company is stealing their money and resents the customers I get an average of around 60 of tips per shift On a good night this can go up to over 100 and on a poor night its around 40 Around 50 of a waiters income is tips All restaurants should have to publicly state their exact tipping policy America has it pretty good everyone tips 2 Elle 22 Edinburgh We never know whether its fair Average tips 20 per eighthour shift I think they treat waiters best in France I have three parttime catering jobs My main day job is in a cafe where the small number of staff work both in the cafe and in the kitchen so all our tips go in a pot and they are shared equally My main evening job is at a restaurant where we dont get our tips but our wages are minimum wage plus an extra 250 per hour My third job is events catering and nobody ever tips In restaurants because a lot of customers add tips through card payments the staff never see how much the tip is so we dont know whether what we get is fair or not The system seems better in France where they dont tip much but being a waiter is seen as a proper job with job security and a

day shifts at a local restaurant In both places all the tips are collected and shared out at the end of the night Money is also taken from the tips to pay for breakages by either staff or customers It is incredibly unfair that our tips are shared out especially when one member of the team doesnt work hard enough Or when a member of the team does incredibly well they dont get what theyve earned Its really unfair that tips go towards breakages made by customers The managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without taking our tips I make around 20 a shift in tips but often I only get 1015 of that money I really rely on tips because I am only paid 7 an hour Id rather we earned a good basic wage like in Australia and didnt have to rely on tips 4 Tom Manchester A big night

20,A topsecret document shows that the US National Security Agency NSA now has direct access to the systems of Google Facebook Apple and other major US internet companies The NSA access is part of a program called PRISM which allows the government to collect search history the content of emails file transfers live chats and more the document says The document says that the NSA can now get information directly from the servers of major US internet companies It says the companies help them run the program but all the companies that commented said they have not heard of the program Google said Google cares very much about the security of our users data We disclose user data to government legally and when the government asks us for data we think about it carefully first Sometimes people allege that we have created a government back door into our systems but Google does not have a back door for the government to access private user data Several senior tech executives said that they had no knowledge of PRISM or of any similar program They said they would never be involved in a program like that If they are doing this they are doing it without our knowledge one executive said An Apple spokesman said he has never heard of PRISM Changes to US surveillance law introduced under President Bush and renewed under Obama in December 2012 made it possible for the NSA to access the information The program allows a large amount of indepth surveillance on live communications and stored information The law allows the NSA to watch customers of companies who live outside the US or Americans who communicate with people outside the US The document says that some of the worlds largest internet companies have been part of the informationsharing program since its introduction in 2007 Microsoft whose advertising slogan is Your privacy is our priority was the first in December 2007 It was followed by Yahoo in 2008 Google Facebook and PalTalk in 2009 YouTube in 2010 Skype and AOL in 2011 and finally Apple which joined the program in 2012 Under US law if the government asks for users communications companies must give that information but the PRISM program allows the government direct access to the companies servers The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act FISA was changed in December 2012 At the time several US senators were worried that the law might increase the amount of surveillance and they could see problems with some of the safeguards in the law When the change in the law was first introduced its supporters said that one safeguard would be that the NSA could not get electronic communications without the permission of the telecom and internet companies that control the data But the PRISM program makes that permission unnecessary because it allows the government to take directly from the companies servers communications that include email video and voice chat videos photos file transfers and social networking details A senior administration official said Section 702 of the FISA does not allow the targeting of any US citizen or of any person who is within the United States It targets only non US persons outside the US Information that is collected under this program is some of the most important and valuable intelligence information we collect and we use it to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats,According to a topsecret document the National Security Agency NSA has got direct access to the systems of Google Facebook Apple and other major US internet companies The NSA access is part of a program called PRISM which allows officials to collect material including search history the content of emails file transfers and live chats the document says The document claims collection directly from the servers of major US service providers Although the document claims that the program is run with the help of the companies all the companies who responded to a request for comment denied knowledge of any such program In a statement Google said Google cares deeply about the security of our users data We disclose user data to government in accordance with the law and we review all such requests carefully From time to time people allege that we have created a government back door into our systems but Google does not have a back door for the government to access private user data Several senior tech executives insisted that they had no knowledge of PRISM or of any similar scheme They said they would never have been involved in such a program If they are doing this they are doing it without our knowledge one said An Apple spokesman said he had never heard of PRISM The NSA access became possible because of changes to US surveillance law introduced under President Bush and renewed under Obama in December 2012 The program facilitates a large amount of indepth surveillance on live communications and stored information The law allows for the targeting of any customers of participating companies who live outside the US or those Americans whose communications include people outside the US The revelation of the PRISM program follows a leak of a topsecret court order that forced telecoms provider Verizon to give the telephone records of millions of US customers to the US government The participation of the internet companies in PRISM will add to the debate about the level of surveillance by the intelligence services Unlike the collection of those call records from Verizon this surveillance can include the content of communications and not just the metadata It is claimed that some of the worlds largest internet companies are part of the informationsharing program which was introduced in 2007 Microsoft which is currently running an advertising campaign with the slogan Your privacy is

NSA document notes that the operations have the help of communications providers in the US During the renewal of the FISA Amendments Act FAA in December 2012 several US senators warned about the high level of surveillance the law might allow and shortcomings in the safeguards it introduces When the FAA was first introduced its supporters argued that one safeguard would be the fact that the NSA could not get electronic communications without the permission of the telecom and internet companies that control the data But the PRISM program makes that permission unnecessary because it allows the agency to take the communications directly off the companies servers communications that include email video and voice chat videos photos voiceoverIP Skype for example chats file transfers and social networking details The PRISM program allows the NSA the worlds largest surveillance organization to get targeted communications without requesting them from the service providers and without needing individual court orders With this program the NSA is able to reach directly into the servers of the companies and get both stored communications and live communications A senior administration official said in a statement The Guardian and Washington Post articles refer to collection of communications under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act FISA This law does not allow the targeting of any US citizen or of any person who is within the United States The program is overseen by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court the Executive Branch and Congress Only nonUS persons outside the US are targeted The program must limit the information it gets keeps and disseminates about US citizens This program was recently reauthorized by Congress after a lot of debate

90,Valdevaqueros is one of the last unspoilt beaches in southern Spain The road to the beach is filled with camper vans from Germany France Italy and Britain The camper vans bring windsurfers and kitesurfers who are attracted by strong winds in the area Valdevaqueros beach is very different from the beaches of Torremolinos and Marbella which are full of hotels and concrete but earlier in 2012 the local council in Tarifa said yes to plans to build a tourist complex next to the beach Environmental groups are angry They say that the project will harm the habitats of protected animals and plants but most of the council just want to create more jobs 18000 people live in Tarifa and 2600 of them have no work Spain is having its worst economic crisis for fifty years Traditional jobs like fishing are finishing so tourism is the only solution said Sebastin Galindo a councillor from the Socialist party Galindo says the complex does not break the law There is a law to stop more ugly developments like those that spoilt a lot of Spains beaches in the 1960s and 1970s This law says that the complex must be at least 200 metres from the coast it will be much farther than that it will be 800 metres Some people say more houses are not needed in Spain because the country already has a million empty houses Galindo says it is unfair to migrant workers who came to Spain when the economy was good Many of the workers are from Morocco which is just 14km away across the sea You can see it from Tarifa Surfers fear that new buildings in Valdevaqueros would make the famous local wind less strong but would not attract people who want a traditional beach holiday Its not really a place for families The wind is too strong said Henning Mayer from Germany Ten years ago they said they would build a new highway here It didnt happen so I think it will be impossible to build new hotels Tarifa is at the most southern point of Spain It is where Africa and Europe meet where the Mediterranean Sea meets the Atlantic It is also a very important place for animals Hours after the Tarifa council voted for the project a campaign started to save the beach The campaign has a Facebook page and is supported by groups including Greenpeace and the World Wide Fund for Nature The Andalusian College of Geographers is also against the project they say that the complex would disturb two wildlife conservation areas and cross the border of a national park They think money is more important than laws said Ral Romeva a member of the European Parliament Romeva believes the project is wrong because the site has too little water The town already has too little water in the hot summer weather of Andalusa Many local people also want to know why they want to built a complex 10km away They think it would be better near Tarifas beautiful old centre We agree with the complex if it creates jobs in the town said Cristbal Lobato who has worked at the same beach bar in Tarifa for 30 years If they put it in the centre of Tarifa where there is space then tourists could visit shops bars and restaurants Standing in the green fields where they want to build the complex biologist Aitor Galn said In other countries they would protect this place but here they want to build lots of buildings They want this place to become Benidorm But what attracts people here is wild animals and the wind,Valdevaqueros is one of the last unspoilt beaches in southern Spain Currently the beach just has an access road filled with camper vans from Germany France Italy and Britain which bring windsurfers and kitesurfers who are attracted by the strong winds in the area For years it has been very different from the concretelined beaches of Torremolinos and Marbella along the coast but earlier in 2012 the local council in Tarifa said yes to plans to build a tourist complex next to the beach Environmental and conservation groups have protested that the project will harm the habitats of protected species but for most of the council the issue is simple jobs Tarifa has 18000 inhabitants and 2600 are unemployed as Spain experiences its worst economic crisis in at least half a century Traditional jobs such as fishing are dying out so tourism is the only solution but it must be sustainable said Sebastin Galindo a councillor from the Socialist party which is in opposition in Tarifa but voted with the governing Peoples Party support the project Galindo says the complex meets environmental standards There is a law that was designed to stop more ugly developments like those that spoilt a lot of Spains beaches when mass tourism first arrived in the 1960s and 1970s This law says that the complex must be at least 200 metres from the coast it will be much farther than that it will be 800 metres Opponents of the complex say more housing is not needed in a country that already has a million empty homes The Socialist opposition in Madrid attacked the idea and Galindo said it discriminated against migrant workers who came to Spain during the boom years many of them from Morocco whose coastline is just 14km away and can be seen from Tarifa Surfers fear that new buildings in Valdevaqueros would reduce the strength of the famous local wind but fail to attract traditional package holidaymakers Its not really a family spot Just wait until they see what the wind is like said Henning Mayer who has come here from Germany every year for 20 years Ten years ago they said they would build a new highway here It didnt happen so I think it will be impossible to build new hotels At the southernmost point of Spain Tarifa is where Africa and Europe meet where the Mediterranean Sea meets the Atlantic Campaigners say it also has a vital role for migrating animals The campaign to save the beach was launched hours after the Tarifa council voted for the project The campaign has a Facebook page and is supported by groups including Greenpeace the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Spanish branch of conservation network Birdlife Also joining the opposition to the project is the Andalusian College of Geographers which says that the site would disturb two wildlife conservation areas and cross the border of a national park Money is once again more important than urban laws and European environmental directives said Ral Romeva a member of the European Parliament In Romevas view another problem with the project is that the site has too little water in a town that already suffers from shortages in the hot summer weather of Andalusa Many locals are also wondering why a resort should be built 10km away and not on wasteland near Tarifas picturesque old centre with its typically Andalusian white walls and small streets dominated by a 10thcentury Moorish castle We agree with the complex as long as it creates jobs in the town but we are against it if it only benefits a few said Cristbal Lobato who has worked at the same beachside bar in Tarifa for 30 years If they put

61,Astronaut Scott Kelly has just spent 340 days in space He says that Himalayan lakes spacewalks and the US presidential campaign helped him to stay sane during his mission It was the longest mission ever It seemed like I lived there forever Kelly said He had been on several missions before but said that his biggest surprise was how long this mission felt Maybe sometimes you go bananas he said Kelly and a Russian astronaut Mikhail Kornienko spent nearly a year on the International Space Station ISS They studied the effects on humans of weightlessness radiation and the cramped conditions of space ight This is research that NASA thinks is very important for a future mission to Mars Kelly said the length of the mission was the most dif cult thing He felt more pain after he returned to gravity than after shorter trips Kelly and his twin brother Mark a retired astronaut have spent the last year taking physical and mental tests The tests will continue to help NASA learn about what happens to the human body during space ight Kelly described the sense of wonder he felt after he landed back on Earth When the Russian capsule opened he felt the cool air of Kazakhstan and smelled a smell like a plant was blooming in that area It was the fresh air mixed with the burnt sweet smell of a spacecraft that had just re entered through the Earths atmosphere When he left the spacecraft he said he began to understand the importance of the mission 340 days on a 15yearold space station which is a million pounds the size of a football eld with the space some say of a sixbedroom house The ISS he said is a place that uses the power of the sun and an international team helped to build it The view is great too he said Kelly posted amazing photos on social media of the Earths cities countryside oceans and atmosphere The Earth is a beautiful planet he said He described the beautiful waters around the Bahamas and the rainbow colours of the lakes of the northern Himalayas But the main thing you notice is how thin the atmosphere is Kelly said It is scary to see the thin atmosphere together with large areas of pollution He said he could see large areas of pollution smoke clouds from wild res cover parts of the US parts of Asia have pollution nearly all year He said the message we need to save the planet was slightly wrong The planet will get better its us that wont be here because well destroy the environment We must take care of the air we breathe and the water we drink And I believe we do have a big effect on that and we have the ability to change it if we want to Kelly was very active on social media so many people follow him online But he said he didnt know about it instead he watched the news and especially the 2016 US presidential campaign The news helped keep him sane he said and also work I looked forward to the next event for example the next spacewalk the next science experiment That made a difference to me Being back on Earth with everyone still felt strange he said Kelly said that he would probably not y again with NASA But I dont think I would ever say Im absolutely 100 nished he said Maybe he will y with private space ight companies which are becoming more and more popular They might need a guy like me someday he said Maybe in the next 20 years youll be able to buy a cheap ticket just go for a little visit,Himalayan lakes spacewalks and the US presidential campaign helped Scott Kelly stay sane during his 340 days in space the astronaut told journalists after he landed back on Earth from a recordbreaking mission It seemed like I lived there forever Kelly said He had been on several previous missions but said that his biggest surprise was simply how long this one felt Maybe occasionally you do go bananas he said Kelly and a Russian colleague Mikhail Kornienko spent nearly a year on the International Space Station ISS in order to study the effects of weightlessness radiation and the cramped conditions of space ight on humans NASA considers this research essential for a future mission to Mars Kelly said the length of the mission was its biggest challenge and that he felt much more sore when he returned to gravity than after shorter trips Kelly and his twin brother Mark a retired astronaut have spent the last year taking physical and mental tests The tests will continue to help NASA learn about how the body copes with the severe strains of space ight He said the discomfort of returning to gravity took nothing from the sense of wonder he felt after he landed back on Earth When the Russian capsule opened on to the cool air of Kazakhstan Kelly said he smelled a fragrance like a plant was blooming in that area It was the fresh air mixed with the charred kind of sweet smell of a spacecraft that had survived reentry through the atmosphere As he left the spacecraft he said the importance of the mission began to sink in 340 days on a 15year old space station which is a million pounds the size of a football eld the internal volume some say of a sixbedroom house The ISS he said is a place that uses the power of the sun and was built with the help of an international team There are things were going to discover about our experience in space in the space station that we dont even know now Kelly said comparing the research of more than 450 missions there to the work done by computer scientists at NASA in the 1960s and 1970s He added The view is great too Kelly made the most of that view he posted spectacular photos on social media of the Earths cities landscapes oceans and atmosphere The Earth is a beautiful planet he said describing the beautiful waters around the Bahamas and the rainbow colours of the lakes of the northern Himalayas He said he would like to visit that region though he would rst need to learn what country actually owns them But mainly you just notice how thin the atmosphere is Kelly added That together with these large areas of pollution is kind of alarming The astronaut said he could see entire systems of pollution smoke clouds from wild res that covered parts of the US sections of Asia with continuous visible pollution nearly all year round He said the message we need to save the planet wasnt completely correct The planet will get better its us that wont be here because well destroy the environment The worlds thin shield of atmosphere makes you more of an environmentalist after spending so much time looking down he said Its for us to take care of the air we breathe and the water we drink And I do believe we have an impact on that and we do have the ability to change it if we make the decision to Kelly was very active on social media which made many people follow him online But he said he was unaware of it Instead he watched the drama of the 2016 US presidential election Besides the news he said steady work helped keep him sane I tried to have milestones that were close like when is the next crew arriving the next spacewalk the next science experiment That made a difference to me it kept my sanity Being back on Earth with the rest of humanity had not quite sunk in he added He recalled how shocked he had been to see a crowd of people after a previous mission Ill soon start feeling that kind of culture shock he said Kelly predicted that he would not y again with NASA But I dont think I would ever say Im absolutely 100

14,The European Parliament have said that health warnings will cover nearly twothirds of cigarette packs and there will be a ban on menthol cigarettes in the EU The EU will ban menthol and other flavours from 2022 MEPs also decided that most electronic cigarettes which are more and more popular as alternatives to normal cigarettes do not to be need regulated in the same way as medicines The Department of Health and ecigarette companies in Britain want to find out exactly what this means for example will ecigarette companies be banned from advertising at sports events The Department of Health said We are very pleased to see tougher action on smoking with European controls banning flavoured cigarettes and the introduction of stricter rules on health warnings on cigarette packs But we are disappointed with the decision not to regulate nicotinecontaining products NCPs including ecigarettes as medicines We believe these products need to be regulated as medicines Smoking levels in England are at their lowest since records began 195 per cent but we want to reduce the numbers of people smoking even more and believe this important step will help UK ecigarette companies who were happy with the parliaments vote said they were already in talks with the Advertising Standards Authority But they said that it would not be a good idea to ban all advertising MEPs decided ecigarettes should only be regulated as medical products if the ecigarette companies said they could stop people from smoking Other groups want ecigarettes used by about 13 million people in Britain to be regulated in the same way as gums patches and mouth sprays which are aimed at helping smokers to quit The MEPs voted to put health warnings on 65 of each cigarette pack At the moment the warnings cover at least 30 on the front and 40 on the back The UK government has not decided if they will do the same as Australia and introduce standardized packaging First they want to know that this will stop people from smoking The MEPs decision about the bigger health warnings on the packaging could become law in 2014 The UK continues to believe that medicinal regulation of NCPs is best for public health said the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority Linda McAvan Labour MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber said We know that it is children not adults who start smoking There are fewer and fewer adult smokers in most EU countries but there are more young smokers Martin Callanan the Conservative MEP for North East England said that banning ecigarettes would have been totally crazy These are products that have helped many people stop smoking more harmful cigarettes British American Tobacco said the bigger health warnings were not necessary and that a ban on menthol cigarettes would make more people want to buy from the black market,Health warnings that cover nearly twothirds of cigarette packs and a ban on menthol cigarettes in the EU have come a step nearer after a vote in the European Parliament Menthol and other flavours will be banned from 2022 and MEPs also decided that most electronic cigarettes which are increasingly popular as alternatives to tobacco products do not need to be regulated in the same way as medicines Health officials and the ecigarette industry in Britain want to clarify what this means for instance whether ecigarette companies will have the same bans on sponsorship and promotion at sports events as tobacco firms The Department of Health would not comment on the advertising issue until officials had studied the MEPs decisions But in a statement the DH said We are very pleased to see tougher action on tobacco with European controls banning flavoured cigarettes and the introduction of stricter rules on frontofpack health warnings However we are disappointed with the decision not to regulate nicotinecontaining products NCPs including ecigarettes as medicines We believe these products need to be regulated as medicines and will continue to make this point during further negotiations Smoking levels in England are at their lowest since records began 195 per cent but we are determined to further reduce rates of smoking and believe this important step will help The UK ecigarette industry which welcomed the parliaments vote said it was already in talks with the Advertising Standards Authority but added that it would not be sensible reasonable or useful to ban all advertising MEPs decided ecigarettes should only be regulated as medical products if manufacturers claimed they could prevent the smoking of tobacco a decision criticized by the governments main medicines regulator They want to put the ecigarettes used by an estimated 13 million people in Britain on the same legal basis as gums patches and mouth sprays which help smokers to quit but the industry says that licensing is expensive and this would force alternatives to tobacco off the shelves The MEPs voted to put health warnings on 65 of each cigarette pack At present the warnings cover at least 30 on the front and 40 on the back The UK government has delayed a decision on whether to follow Australia by introducing standardized packaging until there is evidence that this will reduce tobacco use The MEPs decision which could become law in 2014 will be followed by negotiations with the EU Council of Ministers The UK continues to believe that medicinal regulation of NCPs is the best way to improve public health said a spokesman for the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority Linda McAvan Labour MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber and spokesperson on tobacco issues for the parliaments Socialists Democrats group said We know that it is children not adults who start smoking And although there are fewer and fewer adult smokers in most member states the World Health Organization figures show an increase in a number of our member states of young smokers We need to stop tobacco companies targeting young people with gimmicky products and we need to make sure that cigarette packs have effective warnings Martin Callanan the Conservative MEP for North East England said Forcing ecigarettes off the shelves would have been totally crazy These are products that have helped many people stop smoking more harmful cigarettes and yet some MEPs wanted to make them harder to manufacture than ordinary tobacco British American Tobacco said the larger health warnings demanded by MEPs were not necessary and that a ban on mentholated cigarettes would increase demand for blackmarket

68,A team at Leicester University has told the world that the body they found under a local car park is the body of King Richard III There were cheers when Richard Buckley leader of the team of archaeologists finally said that they were certain they had found the body of the king The evidence is very strong The scientists who did the DNA tests the people who created the computerimaging technology to look at the bones in extraordinary detail the genealogists who found a distant descendant with matching DNA and the academics who read old texts looking for accounts of the kings death and burial all gave their findings Work has started on designing a new tomb in Leicester Cathedral only 100 yards from the excavation site There will be a ceremony to lay him into his new grave there probably next year Leicesters Museums Service is working on plans for a new visitor centre in an old school building next to the site Richard died at the Battle of Bosworth on 22 August 1485 the last English king to die in battle The researchers revealed how he died for the first time One picture showed the bottom of his skull cut off by one terrible hit probably from a razorsharp iron axe The axe probably went several centimetres into his brain and experts say he would have been unconscious at once and dead very soon The injury confirms the story that he died in the middle of the battle without his horse In Shakespeares play he cries A horse A horse My kingdom for a horse Another hit with a sword which also went through the bone and into the brain would also have killed him But many of the other injuries were after death which suggests that the kings naked body was mutilated as it was brought back to Leicester One terrible injury was certainly after death and could not have happened when his lower body was protected by armour It suggests the story that his naked corpse was brought back on a horse and mutilated is true Bob Savage a medieval weapons expert said it was probably not a war weapon It was probably the sort of sharp knife a workman normally carried Michael Ibsen identified as the descendant of Richards sister was shocked when he heard the confirmation on Sunday My head is still not clear now he said Many many hundreds of people died on that field that day He was a king but just one of the dead He lived in very violent times and these deaths would not have been pretty or quick It was Mathew Morris who first found the body in the first hour of the first day of the excavation At first he did not believe it was the king He was digging in the car park a place that local historians and the Richard III Society said was probably the site of the lost church of Grey Friars The priests of Grey Friars were brave they took the body of the king and buried him in their church Ten days later on 5 September when more excavation proved Morris had found the right place he returned with Lin Foxhall head of the archaeology department to excavate the body We did it the usual way lifting the arms legs and skull first and then we lifted the torso so it was only when we finally saw the twisted spine that I thought My word I think weve found him For Philippa Langley of the Richard III Society Richard was the true king the last king of the north a worthy and brave leader who was a victim of Shakespeares negative propaganda Many people still believe he killed the little princes in the tower the child Edward V and his brother Richard were kept as prisoners in the Tower of London when Richard III became king and they were never seen alive again Some bones were found at the tower centuries later but it is not certain they are the princes There may be a need for more DNA detective work there,An extraordinary press conference at Leicester University

church of Grey Friars The priests of Grey Friars bravely took the body of the king and buried him in a hastily dug grave probably still naked but in a position of honour near the high altar of their church The leg bones which were just showing through the soil were covered up again Ten days later on 5 September when further excavation proved Morris had hit the crucial spot he returned with Lin

plastic air conditioning smartphones and fast fashion that are better for the environment The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change met in Copenhagen to present its latest report There is now climate change on all continents We must increase our efforts to reduce emissions to make sure that climate change does not get out of control Copenhagen looked at the risks and challenges but it also looked at the solutions The Sustainia Award looked at ten best solutions to climate change The solutions are used in 84 countries From the areas of food fashion energy transport education and health the awards showed that the future may not be so bad From California we saw how we can now produce plastics from greenhouse gases These plastics are good quality and not too expensive From Switzerland we learned a better way to recycle and reuse old clothes and shoes And from Canada we learned how smartphones can make bikesharing easier The ten projects each offered unique solutions to the problem of climate change The Nigerian project Wecyclers won the Sustainia Award 2014 Wecyclers makes it possible for poor communities to make money from the waste from their streets Families in Lagos collect the rubbish on the streets Then bicycles come and collect the waste Families get points for the garbage they collect They can use these points to get things they need Recycling companies buy Wecyclers waste They make the waste into products such as mattresses pillows and trash bags Wecyclers helps to solve local waste problems in Lagos where only 40 of the citys rubbish is collected Only 46 of town and city waste in Africa is collected More than 5000 families are involved in the Wecyclers scheme and there are plans to start the project in other cities in Nigeria Solutions to climate change are often hitech But to solve all the different problems we need different solutions We cant just reduce emissions we must also use our natural resources more intelligently and create healthier lives for ourselves,When it comes to climate change we usually just focus on the rst part of the story the part about the problem We usually forget the second part of the story about the many available solutions These solutions are speeding up recycling slowing down emissions and providing sustainable alternatives to plastic air conditioning smartphones and fast fashion The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change met recently in Copenhagen to present its latest report on the impacts and speed of climate change Climate change is now measured on all continents Our efforts to lower emissions must be intensi ed to avoid climate change getting out of control Copenhagen looked at the risks and challenges but also the solutions Focusing on what can be done Sustainia Award chaired by Arnold Schwarzenegger celebrated ten leading sustainable solutions used in 84 countries From food to fashion energy to transportation education to health the awards showed that there is an alternative to the grimfuture scenarios we so often read about From California we saw how we can now produce plastics from greenhouse gases that are competitive with normal oilbased plastics in price and quality From Switzerland we learned how we can recycle and reuse old clothes and shoes more effectively And from Canada we learned how smartphones can make bikesharing more convenient The ten projects each offered unique solutions to sustainability challenges but it was the Nigerian initiative Wecyclers that won Arnold Schwarzenegger and the rest of jurys vote It won the Sustainia Award 2014 Wecyclers allows poor communities to make money on waste in their streets By using bicycles to collect and recycle waste in Lagos Wecyclers lets families exchange garbage for consumer goods via an SMSbased point system Recycling companies purchase Wecyclers sorted waste and make it into products such as mattresses pillows and trash bags Wecyclers is a response to local waste problems where its estimated that only 40 of the citys rubbish is collected According to the World Bank only 46 of municipal waste in Africa is collected More than 5000 households are involved and there are plans to extend the initiative to other cities throughout Nigeria Solutions to deal with climate change are often hitech innovations focused on cutting emissions However to successfully solve the variety of challenges we need variety in our solutions as well Sustainability is not just about bringing down emissions it is also a question of using our natural resources more intelligently and creating healthier lives for ourselves These initiatives might be lowtech in innovation but they are highimpact when it comes to creating sustainable change for entire communities With a wide range of solutions for the wide range of challenges we must focus more on the important part of the story that creates enthusiasm momentum and that helps to create positive change,train,ELE,INT

158,Google has made maps of the worlds highest mountains the ocean floor the Amazon rainforest and even shown us a bit of North Korea They want to make maps of the whole world but they have mostly stayed away from the Arctic Now however Google is starting a very important update to hundreds of years of polar map making and it hopes that the map will help give a better understanding of life on the permafrost for millions of web users A small Google team has flown to Iqaluit the largest town in the Canadian territory of Nunavut They have taken their warmest winter clothes many laptop computers and an 18kg telescopic camera that they can fix to their backpacks The team spent four days collecting the images and information that will give the isolated community on Baffin Island something that people across the world who live in cities now take for granted An Inuit mapping expert helped the Google team and curious locals followed them around The town of 7000 people will go on display via Googles popular Street View application in July 2013 When Google made maps of other parts of the world it used a special camera on a car roof In Iqaluit that was not possible so Googles map makers walked the towns snowy roads and trails Some roads are made of ice and disappear in the short summer months The team also walked along part of a 15km road known as the Road to Nowhere despite warnings about meeting polar bears The online map that Google had already created using satellite images was mostly correct but one road was missing that had been built in the last year One difficulty was how to place on the map many businesses and homes that have mail sent to the local post office and not delivered to their address Putting the PO box addresses on the map would mean the new map would show all the companies banks and schools in the same place around the Canada Post building in the centre of town About 30 Inuit elders business people and highschool pupils helped Google to correct this problem They were given a laptop computer and told how to make sure their homes shops and meeting places would show up correctly on the map The project is more than a novelty Arif Sayani the towns Director of Planning said that people who are thinking of visiting or moving to the area would be able to use the maps to see the area It may also help planning decisions in Iqaluit happen more quickly The project leader for Google said he hoped to see the work continue in other northern towns But moving people and equipment around the vast Arctic territory is very expensive So in the future Google might send equipment to the area and ask volunteers to complete the map,It has mapped the worlds highest peaks the ocean floor the Amazon rainforest and even shown us a bit of North Korea But Googles mission to map the world has mostly stayed away from the inhospitable Arctic Now however Google is starting what might be the most significant update to centuries of polar map making and one it hopes will help provide a better understanding of life on the permafrost for millions of web users Google has flown a small team to Iqaluit the largest town in the Canadian territory of Nunavut They have with them their warmest winter clothes a stack of laptop computers and an 18kg telescopic camera that they can fix to their backpacks Helped by an Inuit mapping expert and followed around by curious locals the team spent four days collecting the images and information that will give the isolated community on Baffin Island what people across the globe who live in cities now take for granted The town of 7000 people will go on display via Googles popular Street View application in July 2013 Unlike more accessible parts of the world which have been mapped using a special camera on a car roof for Googles Iqaluit project mappers walked the towns snowpacked roads and crossed littleknown trails some of which are made of ice and disappear in the short summer months The team also walked along part of a 15km deadend road known as the Road to Nowhere despite warnings about the risk from polar bears and other wildlife John Graham mayor of Iqaluit understands the enthusiasm of the locals who followed Googles digital map makers while they worked The Street View project he said follows in the footsteps of the English explorer Martin Frobisher who in 1576 sailed into the bay where Iqaluit now is while searching for the Northwest Passage and the 1941 flight of Captain Elliott Roosevelt an officer and son of the US President which led to the site being chosen for a military airbase His exploration led to the founding of the modern town of Iqaluit What Google had already created on their existing map using satellite images was quite accurate but they were missing one road that had been created in the past year One difficulty was how to situate many businesses and homeowners that have mail sent to the local post office not delivered to their address Putting the PO box addresses on the map would mean the map would show all the companies banks and schools in the same place around the Canada Post building in the centre of town About 30 Inuit elders business people and highschool pupils came one night to help correct such problems They were provided with a laptop computer and shown how to make sure their homes shops and meeting places would show up accurately on the map The project is more than a novelty Arif Sayani the towns Director of Planning said the town would be able to use the maps as a promotional tool for those thinking of visiting or moving to the area It may also speed up planning decisions in Iqaluit The project leader for Google said he hoped to see the work continue in other northern towns However the high costs of moving people and equipment around the vast Arctic territory means they might have to use cheaper methods in the future for example sending equipment to the area and asking volunteers to complete the

78 I said Thank you doctor You can go now She also has a practical idea for people who are overweight I just think people shouldnt eat too much When I hear someone say Oh I cant lose weight I say Sellotape She mimes taping her mouth shut I said this the other day to a big fat man Everything in moderation is my motto Earlier in 2013 Allen was watching the news and saw a woman get the British Empire Medal The woman said Im 80 and Im the oldest fitness instructor in the country I thought No youre not But Allen wont write to the Queen to complain,Not many exercise classes have a tea break halfway through But Margaret Allens does After a gentle warmup and a few quick exercises the 93yearold greatgrandmother lets her group relax with a cup of tea and a quick rest Some of the class of eight look as if they need to rest more than others Allen herself wearing a thick shirt knitted waistcoat slacks and sensible shoes is not even sweating Despite an extremely painful trapped nerve in one leg and a knee in need of replacement she looks like she could go on for hours The general rule is that eating just before doing sport is not a good idea and especially not halfway through the

169,The vicepresident of Google has warned that digitized material from blogs tweets pictures videos and official documents such as emails could be lost forever because the programs we need to view them will no longer exist Our first steps into the digital world could be lost to future historians Vint Cerf told the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences annual meeting He said that we might become a forgotten generation or even a forgotten century because of bit rot where old computer files become useless junk Cerf said we should develop digital methods to preserve old software and hardware to read old files So much of the information about our daily lives is in digital form like our interactions by email peoples tweets and all of the world wide web So its clear that we could lose a lot of our history he said If we want to keep it we need to make sure that people can still see the digital objects we create today in the future he added What is bit rot and is Vint Cerf right to be worried His warning highlights an irony about modern technology we digitize music photos letters and other documents so that they survive for centuries but the programs and hardware people will need to read those files dont survive We are throwing all of our data into an information black hole We digitize things because we think we will preserve them But what we dont understand is that if we dont do something those digital versions may not be any better than the things that we digitized In fact they may be worse Cerf says If there are photos you really care about print them out Ancient civilizations did not have these problems because people wrote histories down and we need only eyes to read them To study todays culture future historians will have to read PDFs Word documents and hundreds of other file types using special software and sometimes hardware too The problem is already here In the 1980s it was normal to save documents on floppy disks and buy computer games on cassettes Even if the disks and cassettes are in good condition we can now only find the equipment to view them in museums Cerf warns that we will also lose important political and historical documents because of bit rot In 2005 American historian Doris Kearns Goodwin wrote a book about Abraham Lincoln She went to libraries around the US and found the paper letters of the people involved In todays world those letters would be emails and it will be almost impossible to find them one hundred years from now said Cerf He admits that historians will try to preserve important material But he says that people often dont understand the importance of documents until hundreds of years later Historians have learned how Archimedes thought about infinity in 3BC because they found his writings hidden under the words of a thirteenthcentury book Weve been surprised by what weve learned from objects that have been preserved by accident he said Researchers in Pittsburgh are trying to find a solution to bit rot They are creating a computer that can read old files Inventing new technology helps but it is only part of the solution It could be even more difficult to get the legal permissions to copy and store software before it dies To do this properly we might need to think about things like copyright Were talking about preserving documents for hundreds to thousands of years said Cerf,The vicepresident of Google has warned that piles of digitized material blogs tweets pictures videos and official documents such as court rulings and emails could be lost forever because the programs we need to view them will become defunct Our first steps into the digital world could be lost to future historians Vint Cerf told the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences annual meeting He warned that we faced a forgotten generation or even a forgotten century because of what he called bit rot where old computer files become useless junk Cerf says we need to develop digital methods to preserve old software and hardware so that outofdate files can be recovered even if they are really old When you think about the quantity of documentation from our daily lives that is captured in digital form like our interactions by email peoples tweets and all of the world wide web its clear that we could lose an awful lot of our history he said We dont want our digital lives to fade away If we want to preserve them we need to make sure that the digital objects we create today can still be viewed far into the future he added What is bit rot and is Vint Cerf right to be worried Accessing digital content in the future could be less of a problem than Cerf thinks His warning highlights an irony at the heart of modern technology where music photos letters and other documents are digitized in order to ensure their longterm survival But while researchers are making progress in storing digital files for centuries the programs and hardware needed to read the files are continually falling out of use We are throwing all of our data into what could become an information black hole without realizing it We digitize things because we think we will preserve them But what we dont understand is that unless we take other steps those digital versions may not be any better and may even be worse than the artefacts that we digitized Cerf says If there are photos you really care about print them out Ancient civilizations did not have these problems because histories written on clay tablets or sheets of papyrus needed only eyes to read them To study todays culture future scholars would be faced with PDFs Word documents and hundreds of other file types that can only be interpreted with special software and sometimes hardware too The problem is already here In the 1980s it was routine to save documents on floppy disks and buy computer games on cassettes Even if the disks and cassettes are in good condition the equipment needed to run them is now mostly found only in museums Cerf warns that important political and historical documents will also be lost to bit rot In 2005 American historian Doris Kearns Goodwin wrote Team of Rivals the Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln She went to libraries around the US found the physical letters of the people involved and reconstructed their conversations In todays world those letters would be emails and the chances of finding them will be incredibly small one hundred years from now said Cerf He concedes that historians will take steps to preserve material considered important by todays standards But he argues that the significance of documents and correspondence is often not fully appreciated until hundreds of years later Historians have learned how Archimedes the greatest mathematician of antiquity considered the concept of infinity and anticipated calculus in 3BC after his writings were found hidden under the words of a thirteenthcentury prayer book Weve been surprised by what weve learned about an earlier civilizations from objects that have been preserved only by chance he said Researchers in Pittsburgh have made progress towards finding a solution to bit rot Digital snapshots of computer hard drives are taken while they run different software programs These can then be uploaded to a computer that copies the one the software ran on The result is a computer that can read defunct files Inventing new technology is only half the battle though It could be even more difficult to obtain the legal permissions to copy and store software before it dies When IT companies go out of business they may sell the rights to someone else which makes it very difficult to get approval To do this properly the rights of preservation might need to be incorporated into our thinking about things like copyright and patents and licensing Were talking about preserving them for hundreds to thousands of years said Cerf,train,ELE,INT
131,A recent report says that the wealthiest people in India will become four times richer by 2018 hundreds of thousands of new entrepreneurs and inheritors will become multimillionaires In India at the moment business people are beginning to be confident again in the worlds biggest democracy Economic growth has been weak in recent years in India The cost of basic foods has risen and the value of the Indian currency has fallen The economy has not been good but there are now nearly a sixth more Indians with more than 375 million than in 2013 the report says Cities are mushrooming the middle class is growing there are lots more opportunities and Indian politics have improved a lot in recent months according to Murali Balaraman a coauthor of the report The richest people in India have money and houses that are worth a trillion dollars This is about a fifth of the total wealth in the country By 2018 that total will probably reach 4 trillion the report says and there will be three times more multimillionaires New rich people are buying lots of luxury things They really want to show or talk about their wealth and buying luxury things is a nice way to do it Balaraman said Abhay Gupta who works for the company Luxury Connect said that more and more people will want to buy luxury things and experiences There is a huge class of people who want to copy very wealthy people he said Cars are very popular things to buy the report says In 2009 wealthy Indians bought Indian SUVs to impress their friends but now they buy foreign cars Mercedes sold 47 more cars in India in 2013 BMW has launched a new 200000 model in Delhi But companies sell fewer luxury cars because of Indias terrible transport system Lamborghinis Chief Executive Stephan Winkelmann said in 2013 that the traffic and roads in India are not so suitable for the 450000 sports cars In India Lamborghini sells two models the Gallardo and the Aventador which has a maximum speed of 217 miles per hour Winkelmann said Lamborghinis Indian customers were much younger than European customers In India a normal buyer is in his 30s But the most popular investments are still houses mainly in India and jewellery Indias superrich have often surprised people around the world with their very high spending Mukesh Ambani Indias wealthiest man has built the worlds most expensive home in Mumbai the business capital The 27storey tower has helicopter pads indoor cinemas and more than 600 people who work there It is worth 1 billion The threeday wedding of the niece of Lakshmi Mittal the steel tycoon who lives in the UK and has 16 billion cost 80 million Hundreds of guests flew to Barcelona for the wedding and party which was in a museum in the city But people who buy luxury things are becoming more and more difficult to satisfy the report says One superrich person bought nine boxes of Japanese whisky that cost more than over 750 a bottle for a wedding party The attraction of the imported whisky was that no one who came to the wedding would be able to find the same drink in India Another superrich person bought identical pairs of Louis Vuitton bags then cut up half of them to make clothes that would match her bags Even the traditional Indian wedding is changing Traditionally people send presents such as silver plates dried fruit or sweets with wedding invitations But now rich people prefer to send gifts by top western designers These days its Rolex watches and Louis Vuitton bags says Gupta Almost half the new multimillionaires live in small cities and many of them give a lot of money to charity Coauthor Balaraman says that more rich people will not create more social problems because a wide gap in wealth is an accepted norm in India People know that someone is rich and someone is poor and they carry on with their lives he explains,According to a recent report the wealthiest people in India will become four times richer by 2018 with hundreds of thousands of new entrepreneurs and inheritors becoming multimillionaires The survey based on interviews with 150 wealthy individuals comes at a time when there are signs of returning business confidence in the worlds biggest democracy Recent years have seen weak economic growth rising prices of basic foods and a fall in the value of the Indian currency But the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP won a landslide victory in May 2014 with its promise to improve the economy Despite the economic slowdown there are now nearly a sixth more Indians worth more than 375m than in 2013 the report says Cities are mushrooming the middle class population growing opportunities have increased many times over and the political environment has improved greatly in recent months says Murali Balaraman a coauthor Between them Indias rich hold assets worth a trillion dollars which is around a fifth of the total wealth in the country By 2018 that total is likely to reach 4tn the report says making three times as many people multimillionaires A booming luxury market is serving the new rich They really want to show or talk about their wealth in a really subtle way and buying luxury goods is a nice way to do it Balaraman said Abhay Gupta the CEO of brand consultancy Luxury Connect said the market for luxury goods and experiences would only get bigger There is a huge aspirational class who look up to what the very wealthy are doing and then copy it he said Cars are among the most popular items bought the report says Whereas in 2009 locally made SUVs were shown off by the wealthy now only foreign cars will impress people Mercedes saw a 47 growth in sales in India in 2013 BMW has launched a new 200000 model in Delhi Indias appalling infrastructure limits demand for luxury cars however Lamborghinis Chief Executive Stephan Winkelmann admitted in 2013 that the traffic and roads in India are not so suitable for the 450000 sports cars In India Lamborghini sells two models the Gallardo and the Aventador which has a top speed of 217mph Winkelmann said Lamborghinis Indian customers were much younger than those in Europe with a typical buyer being in his 30s However the most popular investments are still real estate mainly within India and jewellery Indias superrich have often surprised people around the world with their spectacular spending Mukesh Ambani the countrys wealthiest man has built the worlds most valuable home in Mumbai the commercial capital The 27storey tower complete with helicopter pads indoor cinemas and a staff of more than 600 is worth 1bn The threeday wedding of the niece of Lakshmi Mittal the UKbased steel tycoon who is worth 16bn was reported to have cost 80m Hundreds of guests were flown to Barcelona for the ceremony and party which took place in a museum in

that each winner keeps six people in a fulltime job for a year Winners have contributed almost 750 million to the economy Most of their money was spent on property with 272 billion spent on winners main properties and 170 million in paying off existing debt and mortgages 2125 billion was spent on investments 117 billion was given to family and friends and 680 million was spent on cars and

started in 1994 the UK national lottery has created 3000 millionaires who have won more than 85bn in total at an average of 28m each Between them they have created a further 3780 millionaires among their children family and friends according to the authors of the study Oxford Economics Most winners 59 give up work straight away but 19 carry on working and 31 do unpaid voluntary work The good news for the economy is that 98 of the money the winners spent remained in the UK Through their spending on property vehicles and holidays it is estimated that each winner keeps six people in a fulltime job for a year Winners have contributed almost 750m to gross domestic product GDP and generated more than 500m in tax for the Exchequer The bulk of the money went on property with 272bn spent on winners main properties and 170m in paying off existing debt and mortgages 2125bn was spent on investments Gifts to family and friends accounted for 117bn and 680m was spent on cars and holidays The study was based on research from 100 1mplus winners It found that in total the 3000 winners have purchased 7958 houses or flats in the UK or 27 each spending 33bn Most winners 82 changed their main home spending an average 900000 The new home is likely to have a hot tub with almost a third 29 putting that on their shopping list A walkin wardrobe was absolutely necessary for 28 almost a

followed by the Caribbean 9 Closer to home however UK caravan sales have benefited Over the past 18 years 10 of millionaires have bought a caravan generating sales worth about 74m Some winners 15 have started their own businesses 9 have helped others to do so and 6 have invested in or bought other peoples businesses Businesses started or supported by lottery winners employ 3195 people according to the study Andy Logan author of the report said The effect of a win spreads much further and wider than we expected Not only does it change the lives of friends and family but each win has an effect on

152,James Bond films are one of the worlds oldest and most successful film series Twentythree Bond films have been made so far They have earned more than 6 billion at cinemas around the world James Bond is not slowing down In fact the films are more popular than ever Skyfall which broke all records and became the biggest ever film at UK cinemas in 2012 earned a total of 11 billion So there was a lot of interest when they announced more details about the 24th Bond film especially its title Spectre The number one question is can Spectre be as successful as Skyfall Charles Gant film editor for Heat magazine thinks it can They were very clever when they made Skyfall he says It was both modern and retro Daniel Craig fans liked it and also older more nostalgic Bond fans who lost interest over the previous few films With the new title he adds it is certain to be a success Eon Productions is the company started in 1961 that made Dr No and all the official Bond films The company really wants the next film to be successful so it is using the same people that worked on Skyfall in the new film Daniel Craig will play Bond and the same people have written the script Most importantly Sam Mendes will again be the director According to Gant Mendes is the best Bond director Gant says Mendes attracted top actors like Ralph Fiennes Actors like Fiennes will only be in a film if they like the director The Bond series was not in trouble before the arrival of Mendes and Craig but the films were becoming a bit boring towards the end of Pierce Brosnans time as Bond There were no longer any more original Bond stories to adapt and the films no longer had enough energy This was nothing new the history of the Bond series has been one of constant change especially of the lead actor first Sean Connery then George Lazenby Roger Moore Timothy Dalton Brosnan and now Craig Each new actor has been different and some have been better than others Lazenby only did one Bond film Daltons two films The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill were during a period in the late 80s when more aggressive Hollywood action movies were more popular According to Gant the period of Roger Moores last films and Daltons films didnt excite audiences Brosnan was more successful but Craig is the best On the other hand the early Bond films were sexy and exciting Skyfall made more money than all the other Bond films But some of the 1960s Bond films were almost as successful With figures adjusted for inflation the 1965 film Thunderball is only a little bit below Skyfall And Goldfinger and You Only Live Twice both did better than the other Craig films Licence to Kill made the least money of all Bond films and Moores final film A View to a Kill the second least Martin Campbell is an experienced British director and he planned one of the most elaborate stunts in Bond history In the famous first scene of Goldeneye released in 1995 Bond falls into a light aeroplane without a pilot This scene helped to make the Bond series more modern and popular Also a very successful Goldeneye video game created new younger fans of Bond and made people think that the Bond film was no longer boring and oldfashioned,James Bond films are one of the worlds longest running and most successful film series with 23 movies and more than 6bn earned at box offices around the world But James Bond shows no signs of slowing down In fact Bond is more popular than ever after the recordbreaking performance of Skyfall which became the biggest ever film at the UK box office in 2012 earning a total of 11bn For this reason there was a lot of interest surrounding the announcement of a few more details about the 24th Bond film especially its official title Spectre The number one question is can Spectre repeat Skyfalls success Charles Gant film editor for Heat magazine says it is heading in the right direction Skyfall was a brilliant strategic move he says It was simultaneously modern and retro It appealed to fans of Daniel Craig and it also engaged the older more nostalgic Bond fans who may have lost interest over the previous few films With the new title he adds it is certain to be a success It seems that Eon Productions the company originally founded in 1961 to make Dr No and that is behind all the official Bonds is doing all it can to ensure another success they are installing the key creative talent behind Skyfall on Spectre Daniel Craig will play Bond at least until film 25 and the same writers have produced the script But its getting Sam Mendes as director again that gives Bond fans the most hope A director mainly known for character studies such as American Beauty and Revolutionary Road Mendes has taken the Bond series to new heights Gant says Mendes managed to engage with both the modern and the traditional Bond audience and he also attracted top actors like Ralph Fiennes Actors like Fiennes will only agree to be in a film if they like the director Though the Bond series was not in trouble before Mendess arrival and Craigs there was a certain amount of staleness towards the end of Pierce Brosnans time as Bond The series had survived the drying up of original Bond stories to adapt and the movies were no longer anything like the Ian Fleming originals but they were lacking dynamism This cycle however was nothing new the history of the Bond series has been one of ebb and flow revolving most obviously around the lead actor first Sean Connery then successively George Lazenby Roger Moore Timothy Dalton Brosnan and now Craig Each new Bond has been a response to the state of the series and some have been more successful than others Lazenby only lasted a single film and Daltons two efforts The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill were during a period in the late 80s when the 007 movie was eclipsed by more aggressive slick Hollywood action movies According to Gant the period of Roger Moores last films and the Dalton period didnt really excite audiences Brosnan was more successful commercially but Craig has taken Bond to new levels On the other hand the early Bonds were incredibly commercial films sexy and exciting and there was very little like them Skyfall made more money than all the other Bond films However the performance of some of the 1960s films was almost as brilliant by comparison If you adjust the figures for inflation the 1965 release Thunderball is only just below Skyfall while Goldfinger and You Only Live Twice both did better than the other Craig films and the 70s Bonds The Spy Who Loved Me and Live and Let Die did better too By this calculation Licence to Kill is the worstperforming of all Bonds with Moores final film A View to a Kill the second least successful Nevertheless the Bond brand has remained very powerful over the years and Eon has had to fight off attempts by rival companies to capitalize on the popularity of the series Through a quirk of rights ownership adaptations of Casino Royale in 1967 and Thunderball as Never Say Never Again in 1983 were released in competition with Eon productions After legal disputes that continued for many years Eon now has full control of both books Martin Campbell was another experienced British director and he was able to plan one of the most elaborate stunts in Bond history In the famous opening scene of Goldeneye released in 1995 Bond freefalls into a pilotless light aeroplane This scene really helped modernize the series and increase its popularity Moreover a whole new generation was reached through a hugely successful Goldeneye videogame spinoff which made a significant contribution to perceptions that the Bond film was no longer stale and oldfashioned,train,ELE,INT
124,Rare mountain gorillas live in the Virunga National Park in DR Congo The country could earn 400 million a year from tourism hydropower and carbon credits said a WWF report But a British company want to look for oil there If they look for oil at the UNESCO World Heritage Site that crosses the equator as the Congolese government and exploration firm SOCO International hope it could lead to terrible pollution and conflict says the WWF SOCO say that they would look for oil in a part of the park called Block V and that their work would not affect the gorillas SOCO Chairman Rui de Sousa said that SOCO knows about the environmental importance of the Virunga National Park He also said that oil companies have a central role in todays global energy supply and that a successful oil project could help a whole country But Raymond Lumbuenamo country director for WWF Democratic Republic of the Congo based in Kinshassa said that security in and around the park would get worse if SOCO started looking for oil Security is already bad The UN is involved with fighting units and the M23 rebel force is inside the park Oil would be a curse It always makes conflict worse The park might become like the Niger Delta Developing Virunga for oil will not make anything better Many people live in the park over 350 people per square kilometre Oil would not create many jobs and many more people would come looking for work Lumbuenamo said One danger is that another eruption of one of the volcanoes in the park could damage oil company buildings and machines and lead to oil spills in the lakes Virungas rich natural resources are for the Congolese people not for foreign oil companies Lumbuenamo said But Raymond accepted that although the gorillas were safe now the park would probably not be able to make 400 million It would be difficult to make the kind of money that the report talks of The WWF report says that ecosystems in the park could support fishing and ecotourism and play an important role in providing water and stopping soil erosion The park is Africas oldest and most diverse It is home to over 3000 different kinds of animals Virunga is a valuable asset to DR Congo the report says Plans to look for oil put Virungas future in danger it says,The Virunga National Park is home to rare mountain gorillas but is targeted for oil exploration by a British company The park could earn DR Congo 400m a year from tourism hydropower and carbon credits said a WWF report But if the UNESCO World Heritage Site that crosses the equator is exploited for oil as the Congolese government and exploration firm SOCO International are hoping it could lead to devastating pollution and permanent conflict in the region says the WWF SOCO International is the only company that wants to explore inside the boundaries of the Virunga park SOCO insist that their operations in Congo would be kept to an area in the park known as Block V and would not affect the gorillas SOCO Chairman Rui de Sousa said Despite the views of WWF SOCO is extremely sensitive to the environmental significance of the Virunga National Park Oil companies still have a central role in todays global energy supply and a successful oil project has the potential to transform the economic and social wellbeing of a whole country However Raymond Lumbuenamo country director for WWF Democratic Republic of the Congo based in Kinshassa said that security in and around the park would get worse if SOCO went ahead with its exploration plans The security situation is already bad The UN is involved with fighting units and the M23 rebel force is inside the park Oil would be a curse It always increases conflict The park might become like the Niger Delta Developing Virunga for oil will not make anything better The population there is already very dense with over 350 people per square kilometre When you take part of the land for oil you put more pressure on the rest Oil would not provide many jobs people would flood in looking for work he said One fear is that the area is seismically active and another eruption of one of the volcanoes in the park could damage oil company infrastructure and lead to oil spills in the lakes Virungas rich natural resources are for the benefit of the Congolese people not for foreign oil prospectors Our countrys future depends on sustainable economic development said Lumbuenamo For me choosing the conservation option is the best option Once you have started drilling for oil theres no turning back he said But Lumbuenamo accepted that while the gorillas were safe now the chances of the park making 400m a year were small It would be difficult to make the kind of money that the report talks of Virunga used to be a very peaceful place and can be again The security situation right now is bad The UN is involved with fighting units Its not as quiet as it used to be According to the WWF report ecosystems in the park could support hydropower generation fishing and ecotourism and play an important role in providing secure water supplies regulating climate and preventing soil erosion The park Africas oldest and most diverse is home to over 3000 different kinds of animals but is now heavily populated with desperately poor people many of whom went there after the Rwanda massacre in 1994 In all the park could support around 45000 permanent jobs In addition people around the world could know that the park is well managed and is safe for future generations says the report Virunga represents a valuable asset to DR Congo and contributes to Africas heritage as the oldest and most biodiverse park on the continent the report continues Plans to explore for oil and exploit oil reserves put Virungas potential value at risk it

85,Imagine that you read a headline Fit in four minutes in a health magazine Would you believe it Well Dr Izumi Tabatas training programme 20 seconds of intensive effort ten seconds of rest repeat eight times promises that it is possible to be fit with just 88 minutes of training a week Tabata remembers the first time he tested his training system on his university students in the early 1990s After four minutes hard exercise they were completely exhausted They were almost dead But after six weeks they saw the results and were surprised We all were surprised Tabata created his training programme after he watched Japans speed skating team in the early 1990s He saw that short bursts of very hard exercise were as effective as hours of normal exercise Tabata tried to prove this with a simple experiment One group of students did an hour of cardiovascular exercise on an exercise bike five times a week The other group did a tenminute warmup on the bike then four minutes of Tabata training four times a week plus one 30minute session of exercise with two minutes of Tabata The results were very surprising After six weeks of testing the group who did Tabatas plan exercising for just 88 minutes a week increased their anaerobic capacity by 28 and their VO2 max by 15 The other group who trained for five hours every week also improved their VO2 max but only by 10 But their training had no effect on their anaerobic capacity But you have to work very very hard You cant sit on a machine chewing gum and reading HELLO magazine You have to do intensive bursts of activity on an exercise bike or rowing machine explosive bodyweight exercises sprints and so on Remember how you felt after doing a 100m sprint at school Imagine doing eight sprints with only a tensecond break between them Full effort at 170 of your VO2 max is the basis of the programme says Tabata If you feel OK afterwards youve not done it properly The first three repetitions will feel easy but the last two will feel impossible In the original plan we wanted eight repetitions but some people could only do six or seven One person on an online forum wrote Most people cannot do it correctly and they shouldnt even try Tabata doesnt completely agree Everyone can do it but beginners should start with educated trainers so that they dont work too hard he explains He also says that his programme burns an extra 150 calories in the 12 hours after exercise Most people use it to get fit or to get even fitter but the programme also burns fat So its a little surprising that at the moment only serious athletes are doing the programme This may change because Tabata says there will soon be Tabata instructors and a series of DVDs at the end of the year I decided to do this because I often go on YouTube and some people are doing it wrong because they dont understand how hard they need to work says Tabata So should we all start using Tabata in our fitness programmes Richard Scrivener a former rugby fitness coach says that you should not stop your usual training Tabata training is something extra Runners for example need to run a lot of miles in their training he says But they could do fewer long runs by introducing Tabata training This will give their bodies the chance to rest and recover especially if they have injuries Gym fans can benefit by doing three strength sessions and three Tabatas a week And the rest of us can slowly increase the number of sessions but we know that it will never get easier because every session needs maximum effort Thats the programme it is hard but it works,Fit in four minutes sounds like a headline from a health magazine or an impossible promise on latenight satellite TV Then you try Dr Izumi Tabatas training programme 20 seconds of allout effort ten seconds of rest repeat eight times and after collapsing on the floor you realize you were wrong Tabata has seen it all before They were dead he laughs as he remembers the first time he tried out his system on his university students in the early 1990s After four minutes hard exercise they were completely exhausted But after six weeks they saw the results and were surprised We all were He began his research after he watched Japans speed skating team in the early 1990s he noticed that short bursts of incredibly hard exercise seemed to be at least as effective as hours of moderate training Tabata tried to prove this with a simple experiment One group of moderately trained students did an hour of steady cardiovascular exercise on an exercise bike five times a week The other group did a tenminute warmup on the bike followed by four minutes of Tabata training four times a week plus one 30minute session of steady exercise with two minutes of Tabata The results were very surprising After six weeks of testing the group following Tabatas plan exercising for just 88 minutes a week had increased their anaerobic capacity by 28 and their VO2 max something that shows your cardiovascular health and maximal aerobic power by 15 The control group who trained for five hours every week also improved their VO2 max but by 10 and their training had no effect on anaerobic capacityWe also measured increases in heart size after three weeks of doing the exercises says Tabata But you have to work very very hard You cant sit on a cross trainer chewing gum and reading the latest issue of HELLO The programme demands intensive bursts on a stationary bike or rowing machine explosive bodyweight exercises sprints and so on Remember how you felt after doing a 100m sprint at school Imagine doing eight of them with only a tensecond break to recover Allout effort at 170 of your VO2 max is the basis of the programme says Tabata If you feel OK afterwards youve not done it properly The first three repetitions will feel easy but the last two will feel impossibly hard In the original plan the aim was to get to eight but some only managed six or seven One person on an online forum wrote When done correctly you should meet God Most people are incapable of doing it correctly and shouldnt even try Tabata doesnt completely agree Everyone can do it but beginners should start with educated trainers so that they can work at the correct intensity for them he explains He adds that his programme burns an extra 150 calories in the 12 hours after exercise even at rest So although it is used by most people to get fit or by fit people to get even fitter it also burns fat Its slightly surprising therefore that only serious athletes follow the programme at the moment But that may change now that Tabata has agreed a deal that will lead to a network of instructors and a DVD range released towards the end of the year I decided to do this because I often go on YouTube and while I am pleased that people are doing it some are doing it wrong because they dont realize how hard they need to work says Tabata So should we all start following this plan Richard Scrivener a former rugby fitness coach says that while the benefits are clear Tabatas are an addition not a replacement to a favoured sport or training method Runners for instance need a high level of running economy which comes from learning the skills and running for many miles says Scrivener But they could reduce the number of long runs and the overall mileage by introducing Tabata training This will give joints the chance to rest and recover especially if you have a history of injuries and you would probably therefore get more benefit from the long runs when you do them Gym rats can benefit by doing three strength sessions and three Tabatas a week And the rest of us can slowly increase the number of sessions although we know that it will never get easier because every session needs maximum effort Thats the cruel genius of the programme it is hard and effective,train,ELE,INT

thousands of supporters from around the world who have made the beach into a party zone Some danced some took photos some drank but mostly they just walked and talked about football waiting for the next game to begin on the big screen nearby The friendly mostly peaceful mood was very different from the protests transport chaos and stadium problems during the preparations for the World Cup But now the football has started visiting supporters want to enjoy the experience If I knew when I started planning how complicated and expensive it would be I wouldnt have come But now that were here its

Everyone enjoyed Robin van Persies extraordinary diving header for the Netherlands against Spain And there have been lots of goals 28 in the rst eight games almost three times as many as at the same stage in South Africa in 2010 LatinAmerican teams have been very successful so far and as most fans are from neighbouring countries this has added to the carnival atmosphere Up to now the tournament has avoided the problems many people predicted though it is not trouble free The stadiums were delivered late and in some cases not fully nished but there have been no structural problems or dif

protests have happened less often since the opening day when small demonstrations took place in several cities and police used pepper spray Since then the only security problem has been petty theft

World Cup fever with brightly decorated streets and ags on many cars The English Football Association chairman Greg Dyke said there was a big difference in atmosphere Weve had a really warm welcome in Manaus Its a big thing for them But we were in Sao Paulo for four or ve days before the rst match and it was hard to see until the last day that the World Cup was happening It was weird,There are worse things to do in life than stroll along Rios Copacabana beach in the sunshine on the way to watch a World Cup match so it was perhaps not surprising that England fan Anthony McDowell from

170,Swedish prisons have a reputation around the world for being liberal and modern But are the countrys prisons too soft The head of Swedens prison and probation service Nils Oberg said in November 2013 that four Swedish prisons will close because of an out of the ordinary drop in the number of prisoner There has been no fall in crime rates but between 2011 and 2012 there was a 6 drop in the number of people in Swedens prisons now a little over 4500 Oberg said he was confused by the drop in numbers but hoped that the reason was to do with how his prisons are managed We certainly hope that the efforts we put into rehabilitation and into stopping criminals from reoffending has made a difference he said The modern prison service in Sweden is very different from when I joined as a young prison officer in 1978 says Kenneth Gustafsson governor of Kumla Prison Swedens most secure jail When I joined prisoners were treated well maybe too well But after highprofile escapes in 2004 we had to make the prisons more secure In Sweden prison sentences are not usually for more than ten years Sweden was the first country in Europe to introduce the electronic tagging of criminals and it continues to keep prison sentences short when possible by using communitybased punishments These have stopped many criminals from reoffending The reoffending rate in Sweden is between 30 and 40 to compare that with another European country the number is around half that of the UK One thing that has kept reoffending down and the number of prisoners in Sweden below 70 per 100000 people is that anyone under 15 cannot be responsible for their crime Also in Sweden no young person under the age of 21 can be sentenced to life this is not the same in many other countries and they try to keep young offenders out of prison One reason for the drop in prison numbers might be the amount of postprison support available in Sweden A governmentrun probation service gives treatment programmes to offenders with drug alcohol or violence problems Around 4500 Swedes help the service they volunteer to make friends with and support offenders In Sweden we believe very much in the idea of rehabilitation says Gustafsson Of course there are some people who will not or cannot change But in my experience most prisoners want to change and we must do what we can to help them,Swedish prisons have long had a reputation around the world for being progressive But are the countrys prisons a soft option The head of Swedens prison and probation service Nils Oberg said in November 2013 that four Swedish prisons will close due to an out of the ordinary fall in prisoner numbers Although there has been no fall in crime rates between 2011 and 2012 there was a 6 fall in Swedens prisoner population now a little over 4500 A similar decrease is expected in 2013 and 2014 Oberg said he was puzzled by the unexpected fall but hoped that the reason was to do with how his prisons are run We certainly hope that the efforts we put into rehabilitation and preventing criminals from reoffending has made a difference he said The modern prison service in Sweden is very different from when I joined as a young prison officer in 1978 says Kenneth Gustafsson governor of Kumla Prison Swedens most secure jail 130 miles west of Stockholm However he doesnt think the system has gone soft When I joined the focus was very much on humanity in prisons Prisoners were treated well maybe too well some might say But after a number of escapes in 2004 we had to place more emphasis on security The Swedes still have a humane approach to sentencing even of the most serious offenders jail sentences are not usually more than ten years Those who receive life imprisonment can still apply to the courts after a decade to have the sentence changed to a fixed sentence usually between 18 and 25 years Sweden was the first country in Europe to introduce the electronic tagging of convicted criminals and continues to keep prison sentences short wherever possible by using communitybased measures These have been effective at stopping criminals from reoffending The overall reoffending rate in Sweden is between 30 and 40 over three years to compare that with another European country the number is around half that of the UK One thing that has kept reoffending down and the number of prisoners in Sweden below 70 per 100000 people is that the age of criminal responsibility is 15 In the UK for example children aged ten to 17 and young people under the age of 21 have the highest reoffending rates In Sweden no young person under the age of 21 can be sentenced to life this is not the case in many other countries and they try to keep young offenders out of prison One strong reason for the fall in prison numbers might be the amount of postprison support available in Sweden A governmentrun probation service supervises people on probation and provides treatment programmes for offenders with drug alcohol or violence problems The service is helped by around 4500 members of the public who volunteer to befriend and support offenders under supervision I spoke to a former prisoner who now runs a group called XCons Sweden Peter Soderlund served almost three years of a fouryear sentence for drug and weapons offences before he was released in 1998 He was helped by an organization run by other former prisoners called Kris Criminals Return Into Society Both organizations work with the same goal helping prisoners successfully fit back into society after they have been released And what is life like for the prisoner in Sweden When I was inside I was lucky says Soderlund In Osteraker Prison where I served my sentence we were treated well But I knew that not all Swedish prisons were like that I met so many people in there who needed help after I received help from Kris I knew I wanted to help others With XCons we meet them at the prison gate and support them into accommodation and offer a network of support In Sweden we believe very much in the idea of rehabilitation says Gustafsson Of course there are some people who will not or cannot change But in my experience the majority of prisoners want to change and we must do what we can to help them,train,ELE,INT
7,Youve spent eight hours in the office Youve finished the most important work of the day This is the time when most workers would think about going home But for millions of Japanese employees if they leave work and arrive home in time for dinner people say that they are disloyal to their company But now the government is trying to do something about Japans culture of overwork It wants to make workers take at least five days paid holiday a year Japanese employees are allowed an average of 185 days paid holiday a year Companies must allow them a minimum of ten days paid holiday plus 15 oneday national holidays But very few employees take these days Most take only nine days of holiday according to the labour ministry Many British workers think that a twoweek summer holiday is their right but workers in Japan think that a fournight vacation in Hawaii is a big selfindulgence By 2020 the government hopes that the law will make Japanese employees follow the example of British workers who take an average of 20 days paid annual leave and workers in France who take an average of 25 Japans employees are respected and admired in the rest of the world for their commitment to the company But they often have no time for anything else Couples dont have time to start families So Japan has a low birth rate and the population is declining More employees are falling ill from stress or even dying through overwork About 22 of Japanese work more than 49 hours a week compared with 16 of US workers and 11 in France and Germany according to data from the Japanese government Nobody else uses their vacation days says Erika Sekiguchi a 36yearold worker She spends 14 hours a day at work and used only eight of her 20 days of paid vacation in 2014 six of which were sick leave Yuu Wakebe who works at the health ministry admits that he does 100 hours of overtime a month It is a workers right to take paid vacations Wakebe said But workers in Japan have to do a lot of extra work for no money Workers are scared that their colleagues will think they are not working hard enough This is one reason for a rise in stressrelated illness early death and suicide About 200 people die every year from heart attacks and strokes in Japan caused by long hours and hard work,Youve spent eight hours in the office The most important work of the day is done whatever is left can wait until the morning This is the point many workers would think about heading for the door But for millions of Japanese employees the thought of leaving their desks and being at home in time for dinner is enough to make people accuse them of disloyalty For decades the government has allowed companies to make sure their workforce is as productive as possible But now it is challenging Japans culture of overwork The government is considering making it a legal requirement for workers to take at least five days paid holiday a year Japanese employees are currently entitled to an average 185 days paid holiday a year only two fewer than the global average with a minimum of ten days as well as 15 oneday national holidays In reality very few employees take these days Most use only nine of their 185day average entitlement according to the labour ministry While many British workers see a twoweek summer holiday as their right workers in Japan think that a fournight vacation in Hawaii is complete selfindulgence By the end of the decade the government hopes that the law will push Japanese employees towards following the example set by British workers who use an average of 20 days paid annual leave and those in France who take an average of 25 Japans tough work culture helped turn it into an economic superpower its employees respected and admired in the rest of the world for their commitment to the company but they have little time to do anything except work Japans low birth rate and population decline are partly blamed on the lack of time couples have to start families More employees are falling ill from stress or worse succumbing to karoshi death through overwork Japanese people continue to work hard despite studies that suggest that longer hours in the office or workshop or on the factory floor do not necessarily make people more productive About 22 of Japanese people work more than 49 hours a week compared with 16 of US workers and 11 in France and Germany according to data from the Japanese government At 35 South Koreas workaholics work even more Erika Sekiguchi spends 14 hours a day at work and gives up many of her paid holidays But she is not even an extreme example The 36yearold trading company employee used eight of her 20 days of paid vacation in 2014 six of which were sick leave Nobody else uses their vacation days Sekiguchi said Yuu Wakebe a health ministry official overseeing policy on working hours admits that he does 100 hours of overtime a month He blames the pressure to match the number of hours your colleagues work It is a workers right to take paid vacations Wakebe said But working in Japan involves quite a lot of volunteer spirit That fear of being ostracized at work is the reason for a rise in stressrelated illness premature death and suicide According to official data about 200 people die every year from heart attacks strokes and other karoshi events because of tough work schedules The prime minister Shinzo Abe is not known for taking long vacations But even he has said that companies ask too much of their employees and that working hours in Japan are too long,train,ELE,INT
122,According to a new survey there are more tigers in Nepal than at any time since the 1970s The number of big cats has been decreasing in south Asia for 100 years but conservationists now hope that we can save them The number of wild royal bengal tigers in Nepal has increased to 198 a 636 increase in five years the survey showed This is very good news said Maheshwar Dhakal an ecologist with Nepals Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation The survey looked at pictures from more than 500 cameras in five protected areas and three wildlife corridors More than 250 conservationists and wildlife experts worked on the survey which cost about 250000 Dhakal said that there was a similar survey in India and the results from both countries will be published later in 2013 It will take a few more months for India which now has 1300 big cats in several huge protected areas to finish the survey he added Nepal says it will double the population of tigers by the year 2022 from 121 in 2009 to 242 Some rich people want tiger skins Tiger body parts are used in traditional Chinese medicine International gangs pay poor local Nepali people large amounts of money to kill the cats The skin and bones are taken through the border to India where the big dealers are One big problem is that some senior officials help the mafia who are involved in the illegal buying and selling Conservation experts believe that tiger numbers have increased because the police are controlling national parks better and because there is now better management of tiger habitats in Nepal where forests cover 29 of the land But they say Nepal must do more to protect the habitat and animals that tigers eat so the big cats have enough space to move around and food to eat The number of tigers has increased but attacks on villagers have increased too Seven people were killed in attacks by tigers around national parks in 2012 compared to four in 2011 park officials said Villagers also want better protection The government is making conservation plans for tigers But it should also make plans to protect people from tigers Krishna Bhurtel a village leader told a Nepali newspaper Recently a tiger was captured after it killed two people including a villager who was pulled from his bed in May Thousands of tigers used to lived in the forests in Bangladesh India and Nepal But their numbers have decreased to about 3000 a 95 decrease in one hundred years Chitwan National Park in central Nepal has the most adult tigers with 120 followed by Bardiya National Park 50 and Shukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve 17 Tiger skins are popular in Tibet where rich people use them as festival costumes In Nepal kings used to stand on tiger skins for special occasions Some rich Nepali have tiger heads on the walls of their living rooms Tiger bones are in high demand for use in traditional Chinese medicine People can make a lot of money selling tiger skins and bones illegally,According to a new census there are more tigers in Nepal than at any time since the 1970s This has given conservationists hope that the big cats whose numbers have been dropping across south Asia for 100 years can be saved The number of wild royal bengal tigers in Nepal has increased to 198 a 636 rise in five years the government survey showed This is very good news said Maheshwar Dhakal an ecologist with Nepals Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation The census is based on the examination of pictures from more than 500 cameras in five protected areas and three wildlife corridors More

later in 2013 It will take a few more months for India which now has 1300 big cats in several huge protected areas to finish the survey he added Nepal has promised to double the population of tigers by the year 2022 from 121 in 2009 when the last systematic tiger count took place Increasing wealth in Asia has led to higher prices for tiger skins and the body parts used in traditional Chinese medicines International gangs pay poor local Nepali large amounts of money to kill the cats The skin and bones are given to middlemen who pass easily through the border with India where the major dealers are based One major problem is that some senior officials help mafia networks involved in the trade Conservation experts believe that the increase in tiger numbers is the result of better policing of national parks and better management of tiger habitats in Nepal where forests cover 29 of the land But they say Nepal needs to do more to protect the habitat and animals on which tigers feed so the big cats have enough space to roam and food to eat As the number of tigers has increased over the years conflict with villagers has increased too Seven people were killed in attacks by

to let children leave for two to three hours a day to attend school and to make sure the workplace is safe for the children says Nasrin When the children have missed starting school at five years old

attack in June on a hospital in Quetta capital of Baluchistan and killings of female teachers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa That is why they are blasting schools every day because they were and they are afraid of change afraid of the equality that we will bring to our society The Stand with Malala petition that is asking for education for the 57 million children around the world who do not go to

extraordinary four years for the girl from Mingora in Pakistan She was thrust into the public glare after she wrote a blog for the BBC Urdu service describing her experiences of struggling to get an education under the rising power of Taliban militants By 11 she was showing exceptional determination calling personally on the US special representative to Pakistan Richard Holbrooke to use his influence against the Talibans efforts to stop education for girls By 14 she was on the radar of Archbishop Desmond Tutu who suggested her for the International Childrens Peace Prize and by 15 she became the youngest Nobel Peace Prize nominee in history But all this global attention came at a price Death threats followed and on 9 October 2012 following a meeting of Pakistani Taliban leaders the

slightly drooping left side of her face to hint at such fresh traumas There was one other allusion to the horror of her past she wore a white shawl belonging to a woman who was also targeted by extremists but who unlike Malala did not survive Benazir Bhutto the former prime minister of Pakistan The extremists are afraid of books and pens the teenager continued The power of education

teachers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa That is why they are blasting schools every day because they were and they are afraid of change afraid of the equality that we will bring to our society And she gave her own opposing interpretation of Islam to the Talibans They think that God is a tiny little conservative being who would send girls to hell just because they go to school The terrorists are misusing the name of Islam and Pashtun society for their own personal benefits Islam is a religion of peace humanity and brotherhood Islam says that it is not only each childs right to get education but their duty and responsibility Such ability to say what normally remains unsaid to give voice to young people who are normally silenced has created its own response The Stand with Malala petition demanding education for the 57 million children around the world who do not go to school has attracted more than four million signatures more than a million were added after Malalas speech At the start of her

since 2003 but now the numbers of customers are falling McDonalds says that its worldwide sales have fallen by 33 The company has problems almost everywhere In China sales fell by 23 In Europe sales fell by 4 mostly because of problems in Ukraine and the antiwestern mood in Russia Health inspectors have investigated around 200 of McDonalds 450 restaurants in Russia and they have closed ten restaurants But the worst crisis is in the US where McDonalds has around 40 of its restaurants Almost 60 years since Ray Kroc opened his rst restaurant in Des Plaines Illinois consumers are losing their appetite for a Big Mac and fries Sales have fallen every month for 12 months in the US Many younger diners are eating at rival companies such as Chipotle Mexican Grill The number of 19to21yearolds who visit McDonalds once a month has fallen by 13 since 2011 Another problem is that McDonalds hamburgers were recently named the worst in America in a poll of more than 32000 American diners they said they would rather eat a burger at Five Guys Smashburger or Fuddruckers Many people also believe that McDonalds is less healthy than most of its rivals especially Chipotle Chipotle uses antibioticfree meat and locally sourced seasonal ingredients McDonalds asked customers for their opinions in the US in October Someone asked Have you ever used pink slime in your burgers pink slime is the beef ller that is used for dog food McDonalds stopped using this meat product in 2012 but McDonalds Chief Executive Don Thompson said the company still had to improve peoples opinions about the freshness and quality of its ingredients McDonalds has always had a reputation for fast service at low prices But since it introduced 2 items on its dollar menu people think it is more expensive than its rivals and many consumers complain that service is slower But Mary Chapman at food analysts Technomic said that it wasnt fair to say that McDonalds was more expensive than its rivals Prices have gone up but they havent gone up as quickly as the rest of the fastfood chains in the US Prices at McDonalds have increased by 48 since 2009 much less than the fastfood average up 194 But people are right when they complain that the queues are longer McDonalds has a bigger menu than some other restaurants with more complicated items its chicken McWrap takes 60 seconds to make I think it is worth waiting but the guy behind me who wants his double cheeseburger for a dollar might not said Chapman McDonald managers are promising to improve peoples opinions about its food in the US Thompson has promised more organic food and build your own burgers But to reduce queues he also wants to introduce simpler menus How can the company have simpler menus and at the same time a larger selection of llings They want to simplify the menu but also offer build your own burgers that sounds tricky said consumer expert Mark Kalinowski Only four out of McDonalds 14000 US restaurants have tested build your own burger he said Right now we are sceptical we would like to see more detail Sales are falling but McDonalds continues to expand around the world by the end of 2014 it expects to open 1400 new restaurants Kalinowski thinks that McDonalds sales will continue to fall but he thinks it will be number one for many years,McDonalds is the worlds biggest burger chain and a global emblem of American consumer capitalism But these days the golden arches of McDonalds are looking a little tarnished After a decade of expansion customers around the world dont seem to be lovin it any more McDonalds has revealed that worldwide sales dropped by 33 from 2013 The set of results were described as awful The company has problems almost everywhere In China sales fell by 23 because local media showed workers at a local supplier claiming to use outofdate beef and chicken in McDonalds and KFC products In Europe sales are down by 4 mostly because of problems in Ukraine and the antiwestern mood in Russia Around 200 of McDonalds 450 restaurants in Russia are being investigated by health inspectors and ten have been closed But it is in the US where McDonalds has around 40 of its restaurants where the crisis is deepest Almost 60 years since Ray Kroc opened his rst restaurant in Des Plaines Illinois consumers are losing their appetite for a Big Mac and fries McDonalds has seen 12 straight months of falling sales in its massive home market with sales down 41 in the latest quarter Younger diners are deserting the restaurant in droves to eat out at rivals such as Chipotle Mexican Grill The number of 19to21yearolds visiting McDonalds once a month has fallen by 13 since 2011 To add to the companys problems McDonalds hamburgers were recently named the worst in America in a poll of more than 32000 American diners who said they would rather eat a burger at Five Guys Smashburger or Fuddruckers McDonalds is also widely perceived as less healthy than most of its rivals especially Chipotle with its antibioticfree meat and locally sourced seasonal produce although local can mean 350 miles away The depth of consumer mistrust of McDonalds was exposed by a consumer outreach exercise the company launched in the US in October Have you ever used pink slime in your burgers was one question on the Our Food Your Questions website this refers to the controversial beef ller used for dog food that is sprayed with ammonia to make it t for human consumption McDonalds has not used the meat product since 2012 but Chief Executive Don Thompson acknowledged the company had a job to do in addressing misconceptions about the freshness and quality of its ingredients Yet just as McDonalds has been losing the customers who will pay a bit more for food they think is fresher and healthier it has also lost its edge in fastfood essentials speedy service at low prices Ever since it introduced 2 items on its dollar menu it has gained a reputation for being more expensive than its rivals while many consumers complain that service is slower The expensive tag was unjusti ed said Mary Chapman at food analysts Technomic Prices have indeed gone up but they havent gone up as quickly as the rest of the fastservice chains in the US Prices at McDonalds have increased by 48 since 2009 well below the fastfood average up 194 and the cost of fast casual eating a category that includes Chipotle is up 169 US consumer prices rose 11 over the same period But critics are not wrong about the longer queues McDonalds has a bigger menu than some with more complicated items its chicken McWrap takes 60 seconds to make I think it is worth waiting but the guy behind me who wants his double cheeseburger for a dollar might not said Chapman In the UK McDonalds has turned around its business which makes Britain a rare bright spot for the company A competitive breakfast menu improved coffee and free wi have given McDonalds a broad appeal in the UK said consultant Peter Martin adding that 56 of British adults have visited a McDonalds restaurant at least once in the last six months Executives are promising to fight misconceptions about its food in its home market Thompson

afford to spend time sleeping Sleep may make you perform better but its an inefficient way to improve your performance The real prize is finding a way that humans can work on less sleep It is no surprise that the US military is researching this In 2008 the Pentagon published a report called Human Performance which examined the possibility of a future in which soldiers could perform at their best with only a couple of hours sleep Imagine that you could make a human who slept for the same amount of time as a giraffe 19 hours per night This would reduce the number of deaths and injuries An

already have sleeping areas and Huffington predicts that nap rooms in offices are going to become as common as conference rooms in the next two years So how did this happen How did sleep something humans have done since long before Huffington suddenly become so fashionable Many people these days find it normal to pay 10 for green juice and 34 for an indoor cycle class And getting enough sleep fits into this kind of lifestyle Then theres wearable technology Our bodies have become machines that we monitor and optimize for greater efficiency and sleep has become another data set to be monitored What Huffington emphasizes about sleep after all is not that it rests you but that it restores you Sleep she says is the ultimate performance enhancer and getting eight hours of rest has become the ultimate status symbol You know how Arianna Huffington gets her eight hours Well she has nine or so assistants Huffington calls them her ATeam They do everything for her They run her errands plan her travel and load The Huffington Post on her computer in the morning According to the New York Times most of the ATeam can only survive about 12 months in the job because its so taxing The low pay also means many of them take second jobs Basically they dont sleep so that Huffington can and can sell books about it Getting enough sleep isnt just a question of valuing sleep enough to go to bed at the right time its a question of going to bed in the right neighbourhood and in the right body Numerous studies show that youre more likely to sleep badly if youre poor Its hard to sleep if youre worried about your safety or havent had enough to eat Its hard to sleep if youre one of the 15 million American shift workers who work irregular hours Research has also found that theres a blackwhite sleep gap One study shows that white people sleep an average of 685 hours but African Americans sleep an average of 605 hours They also have a lower quality of sleep Researchers say this is partly due to the stress of racism Do you know who gets the most sleep and the best quality of sleep in America Rich white women Who are probably the same people Huffington wrote her book for Huffington describes her promotion of sleep as a revolution but really its a rebranding The very real sleep crisis isnt that a few rich people think its a waste of time the problem is the 99 who cant afford to spend time sleeping Sleep may be a performance enhancer but its an inefficient one The real prize is finding a way to negate sleep deprivation so humans can work on less sleep Unsurprisingly the military is at the forefront of this research In 2008 the Pentagon published a report called Human Performance It examined the possibility of a future in which soldiers could perform at their peak with only a couple of hours sleep Imagine that you could make a human who slept for the same amount of time as a giraffe 19 hours per night This would lead to a twofold decrease in the casualty rate An enemy would need approximately 40 more soldiers to compensate for this advantage Eventually humans will find a way to remove the need for sleep completely Spending a third of your life unconscious wont be a luxury anymore itll be something only the poor will be forced to do At that point we may need a whole new sort of sleep revolution,train,ELE,INT
24,On average a girl born today in the UK will live to the age of nearly 82 and her brother will live to 78 They would have a longer life in Andorra the girl 85 and the boy 79 but will live a little longer than in the US 81 and 76 If they lived in the Central African Republic they would die in middle age 49 and 44 Almost everywhere in the world except countries such as Lesotho which have problems with HIV and violence life expectancy is increasing The best news is that small children die much less often than forty years ago There has been a reduction in deaths of underfives of nearly 60 from 164 million in 1970 to 68 million in 2010 Over the past five years the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation IHME in Seattle has led a very big project to look at the global effects of disease If we know how many children die and why the world can try to keep them alive The big IHME database will help global organizations and governments to better care for us all The project has been controversial IHME has been very radical in some of its methods When they didnt have death registries or medical records they decided the cause of death by an interview with the family called a verbal autopsy The most surprising result has been with malaria IHME said 12 million die of the disease every year this is twice as many as people believed The big increase is in adult deaths It is commonly believed that malaria kills mostly children under five We are taught as doctors that in areas with malaria you become semiimmune as an adult said Dr Christopher Murray IHME Director But he says the evidence tells them that may not be right African doctors write on hospital records that adults are dying of malaria a lot But their fever could be something different he adds The results have led to more studies Although the Director General of the World Health Organization was happy about the IHME study other people are not so sure We need to be very careful said Colin Mathers a senior scientist He thinks scientists need to find out if the numbers are correct One of the most important things in the study said Murray was the very fast change in the main causes of death and the speed of that change is a lot faster than we thought Reduced fertility and longer life have led to an increase in the average age of the worlds population in ten years from 26 years old to almost 30 The change has been dramatic in Latin America for example where countries like Brazil and Paraguay had life expectancy of below 30 in 1970 and almost 64 in 2010 That is a 35year increase in the average age of death in forty years Also important is the change outside Africa from communicable diseases to lifestyle diseases such as heart disease stroke diabetes and cancer That change is very obvious in Latin America the Middle East and southeast and even south Asia Murray said The third big result was he said a surprise to us The study showed that there are lots of people with disabilities and it has a big effect on people who are living longer but not healthier lives The main causes of disability are different from the ones that kill you he said They were mental health problems such as anxiety and depression disorders such as arthritis and lower back pain anaemia sight and hearing loss and skin disease Also there was drug abuse The number of people with these problems is not reducing over time he said We are making no progress in reducing these problems,A girl born today in the UK can expect to live nearly to the age of 82 on average and her brother will live to 78 They would have a longer life in Andorra 85 and 79 respectively but will live a little longer than in the US 81 and 76 If they lived in the Central African Republic they would die in middle age 49 and 44 However almost everywhere in the world with the exception of countries such as Lesotho which have experienced HIV and violence lifespans are lengthening And the best news is that small children are much less likely to die than they were forty years ago There has been a drop in deaths in underfives of nearly 60 from 164 million in 1970 to 68 million in 2010 This last statistic provides justification for the enormous project that the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation IHME in Seattle has led over the past five years involving nearly 500 researchers to assess the global effects of disease Knowing how many children die and from what cause allows the world to focus its efforts and resources on keeping them alive There are many lessons to be learnt from the enormous database they have put together which will help global organizations and individual governments to better care for us all The project was a big task and is not without controversy IHME has been very radical in some of its methods Where they did not have death registries or medical records for instance they have taken evidence from verbal autopsies deciding the cause of death by an interview with the family The most surprising result has been the malaria figure IHME said 12 million die of the disease every year twice as many as previously thought The big increase is in adult deaths It is commonly believed that malaria kills mostly children under five The way I was taught as a doctor and everybody else is taught is that in malarial areas you become semiimmune as an adult said Dr Christopher Murray IHME Director We originally went with that opinion but there has been a change as we have become more empirical following the data African doctors write on hospital records that adults are dying of malaria a lot But he adds their fever could be something else The findings have led to further studies Although Margaret Chan Director General of the World Health Organization gave the IHME study a warm official welcome some of the staff are cautious We need to be very careful in assessing the validity of the figures said Colin Mathers a senior scientist We need to wait to be persuaded by evidence His colleague Dr Tiers Boerma Director of one WHO department added People should understand that some of the numbers are very different and the WHO cant go with any academic publication that states a different number However said Mathers IHME has pushed the envelope with some of these analyses and that is stimulating One of the main themes said Murray was incredibly rapid change in the main causes of death and the speed of that change is a lot faster than we expected it to be Reduced fertility and longer life have led to a rise in the average age of the worlds population in a decade from 26 years old to almost 30 The change has been dramatic in Latin America for instance where countries like Brazil and Paraguay had life expectancy of below 30 in 1970 and almost 64 in 2010 That is a 35year increase in the average age of death over four decades In a place like Brazil the speed of change is so fast that most institutions are not able to deal with it Murray said A second factor is the move outside Africa from communicable diseases and the common causes of mother and baby deaths to what are sometimes termed lifestyle diseases such as heart disease stroke diabetes and cancer some of which have significant genetic triggers That change has been particularly marked in Latin America the Middle East and southeast and even south Asia he said The third big finding was Murray said a surprise to us There is a lot of disability and it has a big effect on people who are living longer but not healthier lives The main causes of disability are different from the ones that kill you he said They were mental health problems such as anxiety and depression and disorders such as arthritis and lower back pain anaemia sight and hearing loss and skin disease In addition there was substance abuse The numbers for these are not going down over time he said We are making no progress in reducing these conditions,train,ELE,INT
38,Felix Baumgartner stood at the edge of space above New Mexico and paused for a moment It was a small step away from the capsule but a 24mile drop back down to Earth Our guardian angel will take care of you said mission control and Baumgartner jumped Ten frightening minutes later the Austrian landed back on Earth He fell at speeds of up to 725 miles per hour and he broke three world records He became the worlds first supersonic skydiver when he broke the sound barrier We love you Felix shouted his team in the control room He was wearing a special suit to protect him against the very big pressure changes during the jump Without the suit a mans blood would boil and his lungs would explode Baumgartner later said that all he could think about was getting back alive but he also said Sometimes you have to go up really high to see how small you are His other two records were for the highest altitude manned balloon flight and the highest altitude skydive The jump was on a sunny morning in good weather Baumgartner went up into clear skies in an enormous balloon it was 30 million square cubic feet and its skin was onetenth the thickness of a sandwich bag At the bottom of the balloon was a capsule where Baumgartner sat in his suit At the correct height Baumgartner went through a checklist of 40 things with his helper Joe Kittinger Kittinger held the record for the highest altitude manned balloon flight before Baumgartner Baumgartner had a problem with his visor This is very serious Joe he told Kitttinger I cant see when I breathe out But they decided to continue and a record 8 million people watched live on YouTube The ascent during which the skies slowly turned black took two and a half hours But the descent was much quicker Three cameras which were attached to Baumgartners suit recorded his freefall of just over four minutes and then the parachute opening Baumgartner has done lots of dangerous things before He has parachuted off buildings and mountains and once into a 600 foot deep cave He did two practice freefalls to prepare for this jump one from 71000 feet and a second from 97000 feet But nothing can compare with his jump above the town of Roswell a place famous for its UFO sightings He was trying to break five different records the first human to ever break the sound barrier in freefall the highest freefall altitude jump the highest manned balloon flight the longest freefall and his jump platform is probably the largest manned balloon in history The jump beat two of Kittingers records before the retired US air force colonel held the high altitude and speed records for parachuting Kittinger jumped from a balloon 19 miles above the Earth in 1960 and gave advice to Baumgartner during the ascent Someone asked him What do you want to do next Baumgartner said I want to inspire young people Id like to sit in the same place in the next four years as Joe Kittinger If there is a young guy who wants to break my record I want to give him advice He said the most exciting moment for him was when he was standing outside the capsule on top of the world He added The most beautiful moment was when I was standing on the landing area and Mike Todd the man who dressed Baumgartner in his suit came and he had a smile on his face like a little kid Baumgartner said that he felt like Todds son He said Todd was so happy that I was alive Earlier Todd said The world needs a hero right now and they have got one in Felix Baumgartner This will be the last jump Baumgartner said He has promised to settle down with his girlfriend and fly helicopters on rescue missions in the US and Austria,Felix Baumgartner stood at the edge of space above New Mexico and paused slightly It was a small step away from the capsule but a 24mile drop back down to Earth Our guardian angel will take care of you said mission control and the man known as Fearless Felix jumped Ten terrifying minutes later the Austrian landed back on Earth He had reached speeds of up to 725 miles per hour and broken three world records including becoming the worlds first supersonic skydiver by breaking the sound barrier at Mach 124 We love you Felix cheered the control room Baumgartner raised his arms in a victory salute He was wearing a specially designed survival suit to protect him against the enormous pressure changes during the jump Without it his blood would have boiled and his lungs might have exploded Baumgartner later told a press conference that all he could think about was getting back alive but he added Sometimes you have to go up really high to see how small you are His other two records were for the highest altitude manned balloon flight and the highest altitude skydive The jump happened on a sunny morning in good weather Baumgartner was carried up into clear skies by a gigantic balloon it measured 30 million square cubic feet and its skin was onetenth the thickness of a sandwich bag At the bottom of the balloon was a capsule where Baumgartner sat in his suit As he reached the correct height Baumgartner went through a checklist of 40 things with his mentor Joe Kittinger Kittinger was the previous holder of the highest altitude manned balloon flight Baumgartner had a problem with his visor This is very serious Joe he told Kitttinger Sometimes its getting foggy when I breathe out But they decided to go ahead watched by a record 8 million people live on YouTube After a twoandahalfhour journey up during which the curvature of the Earth became visible and the skies gradually turned black the descent was much quicker Three cameras which were attached to Baumgartners suit recorded his freefall of just over four minutes and then the parachute opening The success of the mission and of the suit means that astronauts might be able to survive a highaltitude disaster like on the space shuttle Columbia in 2003 by jumping out of their craft Baumgartners top medical man in the stunt was Dr Jonathan Clark whose wife Laurel Clark died in the Columbia accident Clark is now working to help astronauts survive highaltitude disasters Baumgartner has a reputation for daring stunts The former paratrooper has parachuted off buildings and mountains and once into a 600 foot deep cave He had already done two practice freefalls in preparation for this jump one from 71000 feet and a second from 97000 feet But nothing can compare with his

Christmas ads this year but I think a lot of those brands who tried to compete with John Lewis by doing something emotional and creative have gone back to what you can buy in store she said John Lewis

157,Two scientists at Stanford University in the USA used metadata on peoples telephone calls and texts to find out peoples names where they lived and the names of their partners The metadata told them what number people called when and for how long but it didnt tell them what people said But that was not all With the same metadata they could find out private information about some people They discovered that one man had a gun and that another man had a heart problem Other data told them that someone was having a baby and someone had a serious illness The results show the extraordinary power of telephone metadata It is particularly powerful when you use it together with information from Google Yelp and Facebook Stewart Baker who worked at the US National Security Agency NSA said Metadata tells you everything about somebodys life Patrick Mutchler a researcher at Stanford said that people who collect the information understand the power of metadata but that the public was in the dark For the study 823 people agreed for researchers to collect metadata from their phones using an app The app also received information from their Facebook pages which the scientists used to check their results The scientists collected metadata on more than 250000 calls and over 12 million texts With very little money Mutchler and Jonathan Mayer found out a lot of personal information about the people in the study Some of the information was private They found out 82 of peoples names The same method gave them the names of businesses the people called When they marked these on a map they showed groups of local businesses which the scientists guessed were near the persons home address In this way they named the city people lived in 57 of the time and were nearly 90 correct in guessing within 50 miles where people lived Then the scientists used a simple computer program to analyse peoples calls and this helped them to see who was in a relationship Once they knew the owner of a particular phone number had a partner it was easy to find out who the partner was they said For the final part of the study the researchers looked even deeper to see what private information they could get from telephone metadata They collected details on calls made to and from places such as hospitals pharmacies religious groups legal services and gun shops From these they produced interesting pictures of peoples lives Mutchler said the study showed how easy it is to find out private information about people He says that the results should make governments think twice before they record this information Metadata programmes like the NSAs will show very private information about ordinary people the scientists said,The mass collection of telephone records by government surveillance programmes poses a threat to the personal privacy of ordinary people say US researchers They used basic phone logs to identify people and find out confidential information about their lives With metadata on peoples calls and texts but not the content of the communications two scientists at Stanford University worked out peoples names where they lived and the names of their partners But that was not all The same metadata led them to discover confidential information about some people They discovered that one man had a gun and that another man had a heart problem Other data told them about a new pregnancy and a person with multiple sclerosis The results show the extraordinary power of telephone metadata that is the number called when and for how long particularly when you use it together with public information from services such as Google Yelp and Facebook Security services know how important this data is Stewart Baker the former general counsel at the US National Security Agency NSA said Metadata tells you everything about somebodys life Patrick Mutchler a computer security researcher at Stanford said that the power of metadata was understood by people who collect the information but the public was in the dark That made it difficult for people to fight these programmes Now we have hard evidence we can point to that we didnt have in the past he said For the study 823 people agreed to have metadata collected from their phones through an Android app The app also received information from their Facebook accounts which the scientists used to check the accuracy of their results In total the researchers collected metadata on more than 250000 calls and over 12m texts Mutchler describes how with very little money he and Jonathan Mayer discovered a lot of personal information some of it confidential about people who took part in the study They could find out 82 of peoples names The same technique gave them the names of businesses the people had called When these were marked on a map they showed groups of local businesses which the scientists speculated surrounded the persons home address In this way they named the city people lived in 57 of

relationship Once they knew the owner of a particular number had a partner it was easy to find out who the partner was they said For the final part of the study the researchers looked even deeper to see what private information they could find out from telephone metadata They collected details on calls made to and from a list of organizations including hospitals pharmacies religious groups and legal services From these they put together some extraordinary pictures of peoples lives One person in the study made frequent calls to a local gun shop and later made long calls to the customer support hotline of a major gun manufacturer The metadata from two others suggested one had multiple sclerosis and the other had just become pregnant All of this shows what is possible with two graduate students and limited resources said Mutchler He says that the results should make policymakers think twice before allowing mass surveillance programmes Metadata surveillance programmes like the NSAs will reveal highly confidential information about ordinary people the scientists said,train,ELE,INT

42,A report by the World Health Organization WHO says that 356 of all women around the world will experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime usually from a male partner The report says that 30 of women are attacked by their partners It also says that a large percentage of murders of women 38 are done by their partners The highest levels of violence against women are in Africa where nearly half of all women 456 will experience physical or sexual violence In poor and middleincome Europe the percentage is 272 But richer countries are not always safer for women a third of women in rich countries 327 will experience violence 42 of the women who experience violence have injuries which doctors and nurses may notice The report says that injuries are often the first opportunity to discover violence in the home and to offer the woman help Violence has a big effect on womens health Some come to hospital with broken bones and others have problems related to pregnancy and mental illness The WHO has two reports one report is on violence the other report tells doctors and nurses how to help women Dr Claudia GarciaMoreno of the WHO and Professor Charlotte Watts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine wrote the reports For the first time we have compared data from all over the world on partner violence and sexual violence by nonpartners and the effect of these sorts of violence on health said GarciaMoreno These included HIV and other sexually transmitted infections depression alcoholism unwanted pregnancies and babies that are born too small There were differences in the levels of violence against women in different regions of the world but said GarciaMoreno it is too high everywhere Data from 81 countries shows that even in rich countries 232 of women will experience physical andor sexual violence from a partner in their lives The global figure for women attacked by partners was 30 Women report more sexual assaults and rapes by acquaintances or strangers in rich countries than elsewhere The report says that 126 of women in wealthy countries will be sexually attacked by a nonpartner in their lives The percentage in Africa is 119 The report says that their previous research shows that bettereducated women and working women are less likely to experience violence but not in all regions There is a need to change some attitudes said Watts In some societies are certain forms of violence against women acceptable she asked In some societies violence against women is not OK but in some societies it is OK GarciaMoreno said that the percentages show that we must pay more attention to this question Over the past ten years more people see that there is a problem she said but it is a complex problem We dont have a vaccine or a pill The WHO now recommends teaching doctors and nurses to recognize the signs of domestic violence and sexual assault But they do not recommend asking every woman who arrives in a clinic if she has been the victim of violence If a woman comes back several times with injuries she doesnt mention you should ask her about domestic violence said GarciaMoreno,According to a report by the World Health Organization WHO 356 of all women around the world will experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime usually from a male partner The report reveals the shocking extent of attacks on women from the men with whom they share their lives with 30 of women being attacked by partners It also finds that a large proportion of murders of women 38 are carried out by their partners The highest levels of violence against women are in Africa where nearly half of all women 456 will suffer physical or sexual violence In low and middleincome Europe the proportion is 272 However wealthier nations are not always safer for women a third of women in highincome countries 327 will experience violence at some stage in their lives 42 of the women who experience violence suffer injuries which can bring them to the attention of healthcare staff That says the report is often the first opportunity for violence in the home to be discovered and for the woman to be offered help Violence has a significant effect on womens health Some arrive at hospital with broken bones while others suffer pregnancyrelated complications and mental illness The two reports from the WHO one is on the extent of violence the other offers guidelines to healthcare staff on helping women are the work of Dr Claudia GarciaMoreno lead specialist in gender reproductive rights sexual health and adolescence at WHO and Professor Charlotte Watts an epidemiologist who specializes in gender violence and health from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine For the first time we have compared data from all over the world on the extent of partner violence and sexual violence by nonpartners and the impact of these sorts of violence on health said GarciaMoreno These included HIV and other sexually transmitted infections depression alcoholism unwanted pregnancies and lowbirthweight babies There were variations in the rates of violence against women in different regions of the world but said GarciaMoreno in whatever region we looked at it is unacceptably high Data from 81 countries shows that even in highincome countries 232 of women will suffer physical andor sexual violence from a partner in their lives The global figure for women attacked by partners was 30 More sexual assaults and rapes by acquaintances or strangers are reported in highincome countries than elsewhere the report says that 126 of women in wealthy countries will be sexually attacked by a nonpartner in their lives which is higher than the African rate of 119 But the data on such crimes is not well collected in all regions The authors say that their previous research shows that bettereducated women and working women are less likely to suffer violence although not in all regions There is a need to question social norms said Watts What is societys attitude concerning the acceptability of certain forms of violence against women she asked In some societies it is not OK but not all I think the numbers are a wakeup call for all of us to pay more attention to this issue said GarciaMoreno Over the past ten years there has been increasing recognition of the problem she said but we have to recognize that it is a complex problem We dont have a vaccine or a pill The new WHO clinical and policy guidelines recommend healthcare staff should be trained to recognize the signs of domestic violence and sexual assault but they do not recommend general screening that is asking every woman who arrives in a clinic whether she has been subjected to violence But if you see a woman coming back several times with injuries she doesnt mention you should ask about domestic violence said GarciaMoreno When I was training in medical school it wasnt something you learned or knew about Years later I was sometimes in a situation where I could tell there was something else wrong with the woman I was interviewing but didnt know that domestic violence was the issue Now I think I would do the interview very differently,train,ELE,INT
135,Thousands of people protested on Australias beaches against a shark cull in Western Australia They asked the states prime minister to stop the cull and RSPCA Australia and Virgin Atlantic owner Richard Branson criticized it Catching and killing sharks longer than three metres began after a number of shark attacks on Western Australias coast A 35yearold surfer who was killed in November 2013 was the sixth person to die from a shark attack in two years But the whole of Australia has had on average just one sharkrelated death a year for the last 50 years Kate Faehrmann of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society said from a protest in Perth the state capital of Western Australia Weve always said that this idea wont work Drumlines which they use to catch the sharks kill sharks if theyre one two three metres or more and also dolphins turtles and other things Thats why we dont want the cull Thousands of people protested on beaches in the cities of Perth Sydney and Adelaide and at beaches in Victoria and Queensland Faehrmann said the protests showed that Australians wanted sharks to be protected Whats amazing is that so many people in Australia love sharks This has shown that people are scared but thousands of people are coming out across the country to say Thats the sharks ocean We respect them we love them and we dont want you to kill them Anthony Joyce a surfer who once had his foot caught in a sharks mouth said The number of sharks they are going to kill is going to make no difference The state government will not say how many sharks they have killed but some people say that sharks smaller than three metres were released after they were caught on drumlines oating drums xed to the sea bed with bait on hooks underneath them Conservationists say there is no evidence the cull will reduce the number of shark attacks on humans because no other cull has only used drumlines Researchers at the University of Western Australia say the increased number of shark attacks in the state may be because Western Australia has the fastestgrowing population in Australia not because of a rising number of sharks Richard Peirce of the UKbased conservation charity the Shark Trust said that the cull would not work and could bring more predators towards the coast The activity in Western Australia is adding to the human tragedy of shark attacks It is very sad that a government has ignored the best advice and chosen a method that is ineffective and counterproductive he said and even if they monitor drumlines through the day leaving the lines in at night could attract other predators to the area attracted by those sharks and other species hooked and injured Worldwide in 2012 there were 80 attacks by sharks Seven of the attacks were fatal This is compared to nearly 100 million sharks killed by humans each year RSPCA Australia says it believes the cull is wrong There is no evidence that the increase in attacks is a result of increasing shark numbers We think it is the result of a changing population and changing human behaviour that is there are more people in the water it said Richard Branson said the idea was not working Im sure one of the reasons Western Australia Premier Colin Barnett did it was because he was thinking it would encourage tourism Its going to do the opposite I think Youre advertising a problem that doesnt exist in a big way and youre going to stop people from wanting to come to Perth and your beautiful countryside around it All youre going to achieve I think is to worry people,Thousands of people protested on Australias beaches
