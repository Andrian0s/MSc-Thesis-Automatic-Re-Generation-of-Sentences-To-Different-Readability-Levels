18,Joseph Roche is on the shortlist of astronauts for Mars One a private mission that plans to send humans to live on Mars from 2025 He is on the shortlist but he is sceptical about Mars One Roche is an astrophysicist at Trinity College Dublin He is one of the 100 people on the shortlist for the mission He has doubts about Mars One The selection process Roche says did not reach the standard of more traditional astronaut selection processes He also says the Dutch Mars One team are naive because they believe they can succeed alone in the 6 billion mission He says they should now accept it will probably not happen The group plans to send a lander and satellite to Mars in 2018 followed by a rover in 2020 and cargo missions starting in 2022 Humans will start arriving in 2025 and they will send more crews of four people every two years The astronauts will not return to Earth Gerard t Hooft is a Dutch Nobel laureate in physics He is a supporter of the project but he says he does not believe the Mars One plans are realistic He said It will take longer and be more expensive When they asked me to be involved I told them You have to put a zero after everything Roche also said that there were not 200000 people who applied to be astronauts as Mars One said there were only 2761 He talked about the selection process in more detail I have not met anyone from Mars One At first they said there would be regional interviews we would travel there and they would interview and test us over several days To me that sounded like a proper astronaut selection process But it changed from a proper regional interview over several days to a tenminute Skype call Roche says he does not want to give more interviews because he doesnt want to sound negative about space travel He said that being involved in the public debate about future missions is one of the most interesting and enjoyable things about his connection with Mars One He then said that If a oneway mission to Mars ever became possible I would always volunteer For an astrophysicist that is not a difficult decision to make But he does not think there will be a oneway mission in his lifetime,He is not the first person to express scepticism about Mars One a private mission that aims to send humans to live on Mars from 2025 But Joseph Roche is different from most critics hes on the shortlist of astronauts Roche an astrophysicist at Trinity College Dublin who was announced in February as one of the 100 people shortlisted for the mission has written for the Guardian expressing his doubts about the viability of Mars One The selection process Roche writes was not rigorous enough to reach the standard of more traditional astronaut selection programmes He also says the Dutch Mars One team have shown a certain naivety because they believe they can succeed alone in the 6bn mission He says they should now accept it is very unlikely to happen Roche also expressed worries about the way the mission organizers publicized a topten list of candidates The ranking he said didnt mean these were the best astronauts It was based on how many supporter points each had earned He says that these points only show how much each supporter has donated to Mars One for example by buying official merchandise The official timeline for the mission says the group plans to send a stationary lander and satellite to Mars in 2018 followed by a rover in 2020 and cargo missions starting in 2022 Humans would start arriving in 2025 and crews of four would be sent every two years to add to the settlement They would not return to Earth In February a supporter of the project Gerard t Hooft a Dutch Nobel laureate in physics said he did not believe this timetable was realistic He said It will take quite a bit longer and be quite a bit more expensive When they first asked me to be involved I told them You have to put a zero after everything Roche also said that there were not 200000 people who applied to be astronauts as Mars One said there were only 2761 He talked about the selection process in more detail I have not met anyone from Mars One in person Initially there were going to be regional interviews we would travel there wed be interviewed and wed be tested over several days In my mind that sounded like a proper astronaut selection process But all of a sudden it changed from being a proper regional interview over several days to being a tenminute Skype call Roche told the Guardian that he did not want to give more interviews because he didnt want to sound negative about the idea of space travel He writes I am passionate about scientific endeavour and that is why the ambitiousness of the Mars One plan appealed to me Mars One were never likely to overcome the financial and technical barriers during their proposed timeline But it was nice to hear a new idea that challenges us to think about our own role in the future of space exploration He said that being part of the public debate about future missions has been one of the most interesting and enjoyable aspects of his involvement with Mars One He went on to say that If a oneway mission to Mars ever became possible I would always volunteer For an astrophysicist that is not a difficult decision to make But he does not think there will be a oneway mission in his lifetime,test,ELE,INT
134,How long can you hold your breath Im trying it right now The rst 30 seconds are easy I want to give up at 45 seconds but I continue and it gets easier for a while But as I go past one minute my heart is pounding I breathe out a tiny bit and this helps One minute and 12 seconds Im quite impressed with myself In some sports it is very important to be able to hold your breath particularly in freediving In 2006 I met Sam Amps who was captain of the UK freedive team At a swimming pool in Bristol she taught me some simple ways to help me hold my breath for longer while swimming underwater By the end of the session I could hold my breath for 90 seconds long enough to let me swim across the pool Sam swam across the pool three times easily She could hold her breath for ve minutes while swimming Five minutes I asked how she did it very slow breathing for several minutes before each dive then a big deep breath before diving in Our heart rate doesnt slow down when we hold our breath At least it doesnt if youre doing it on land When youre under cold water the heart rate slows down in most people This change in our bodies is useful in diving but it is even more useful for not drowning Holding our breath is becoming very useful in one particular area of medicine Radiotherapy for breast cancer involves pointing radiation exactly at the tumour Its usually done in short periods between breaths But if the patient can hold their breath for several minutes it means that doctors can give the complete radiation dose in the right place all at the same time The problem of course is that most people cannot hold their breath for several minutes But doctors at University Hospital Birmingham have shown that if patients are given air with extra oxygen before holding their breath they can hold it for veandahalf minutes Surprisingly to achieve this you have to fool the diaphragm When you breathe in youre pulling the muscle of your diaphragm at so that the volume of your chest increases this pulls the air into your lungs When you hold your breath you keep your diaphragm like that If you breathe extra oxygen before a breathhold as in the Birmingham radiotherapy experiments you may be able to stop the diaphragm from becoming tired too quickly So its your diaphragm the main muscle of breathing that is in charge when you are holding your breath But in the end even if youve fooled it for a while the signals from the diaphragm become too strong and you have to give up and take a breath,How long can you hold your breath Im trying it right now The rst 30 seconds are easy Im ready to give up at 45 seconds but I continue and it seems to get easier for a while But as the second hand ticks past a minute my heart is pounding I let out a tiny breath and this helps Eventually I give up releasing the air in my lungs and taking a huge breath I manage one minute and 12 seconds Im quite impressed with myself The ability to hold your breath is extremely important in some sports particularly freediving In 2006 I was lming a programme about the anatomy and physiology of the lungs for a BBC series I was lucky to meet Sam Amps who was captain of the UK freedive team At a pool in Bristol she taught me some simple exercises to help me hold my breath for longer while swimming underwater By the end of the session Id managed 90 seconds of breathholding enough to let me swim a width Sam swam three widths easily She could hold her breath for ve minutes while swimming Five I asked how she did it very slow breathing for several minutes before each dive then a big deep breath before diving in She also said that training helped her resist the urge to breathe for far longer than most people Some have suggested that the ability to voluntarily hold your breath is evidence that at some point during our evolution we lived in water Some even say that humans have an ability to lower their heart rate in order to breathhold for even longer Other facts our hairlessness the distribution of our subcutaneous fat and even that we walk on two legs have been linked to an aquatic phase of our evolutionary development But unfortunately the aquatic ape hypothesis is not true Looking at voluntary breathholding we are in fact not the only nonaquatic mammals that are able to hold their breath But its a dif cult thing to investigate in other mammals because unlike humans its dif cult to get them to hold their breath And evidence shows that our heart rate doesnt drop during breathholding At least it doesnt if youre breathholding on land When youre in cold water its different this leads to a slower heart rate in most people But once again this isnt evidence of an aquatic ape ancestry This reduction in heart rate is just one of the physiological responses that are sometimes called the mammalian diving re ex But physiological responses that are useful in diving are also and perhaps even more importantly useful for not drowning While our ability to breathhold may not be special when we compare ourselves with other animals its now becoming very useful in one particular area of medicine Radiotherapy for breast cancer involves pointing radiation very precisely at the tumour This may require several minutes of radiation and so its usually done in short periods between breaths But if the patient can keep her chest perfectly still for several minutes it means that the entire dose can be given in the right place in one go The problem of course is that most people just like me cannot hold their breath for much longer than a minute But doctors at University Hospital Birmingham have shown that if patients are given oxygenrich air before holding their breath they can hold it for veandahalf minutes Surprisingly the trick seems to be the ability to fool the diaphragm When you breathe in youre pulling the muscle of your diaphragm at so that the volume of your chest increases and air is pulled into your lungs When you hold your breath you keep your diaphragm like that If you arti cially raise oxygen levels and reduce carbon dioxide levels before a breathhold as in the Birmingham radiotherapy experiments you may be able to delay tiredness in the diaphragm So its your diaphragm the main muscle of breathing that is in charge when it comes to holding your breath Eventually even if youve fooled it for a while the signals from the diaphragm are just too strong and you have to give up and take a breath,test,ELE,INT

125,A new computerassisted autopsy system is becoming more and more popular in European hospitals Its inventor says that the system could mean that now there will be no such thing as a perfect murder The method called Virtopsy is being used at some forensic medical institutes in Europe It was invented by a group of scientists at the University of Zurich Instead of cutting the chest like in a traditional autopsy pathologists are now able to examine the dead body in 3D via computer screens Michael Thali the Director of Zurichs Institute for Forensic Medicine in Europe and one of the inventors of Virtopsy said it could completely change criminal investigations Basically there will be no such thing as the perfect murder any more because a virtual autopsy allows you to find every piece of evidence he said Virtopsies use powerful machines Together the machines are called a Virtobot Virtopsies can find injuries that are not seen during a traditional autopsy as well as air pockets heart attacks and even cancer The Virtopsy could replace the autopsy one day said Richard Dirndorfer one of the first people to use DNA analysis in criminology I think well see it happen slowly just like DNA analysis slowly replaced blood group analysis The method allows doctors to see deep inside dead bodies It can see things that cannot be found during traditional autopsies Criminologists from around the world have been travelling to Switzerland over the past few years to see the new method Forensic scientists and pathologists think the method can be used together with the traditional autopsy In order to analyze the colour of the blood the thickness of body fluids or smells well need to use traditional autopsy methods said Lars Oesterhelweg Deputy Director of the Institute of Forensic Medicine at the Charit Hospital in Berlin which is using a version of the Virtopsy He added that the new method was very helpful in reexamining cases where the cause of death was unclear It means that investigations can be reexamined and we can try again to find the murderer he said Scientists said that relatives of the dead prefer the Virtopsy method because during a traditional autopsy scientists have to cut and damage the dead body,A new hightech computerassisted autopsy system is becoming more and more popular in European hospitals Its inventor has said the technique could eventually mean there is no such thing as a perfect murder The method called Virtopsy is now being used at some forensic medical institutes in Europe after it was pioneered by a group of scientists at the University of Zurich A traditional autopsy begins by using a knife to make a Yshaped cut in the chest But now pathologists are able to examine the dead body in 3D via computer screens Michael Thali the Director of Zurichs Institute for Forensic Medicine in Europe and one of the inventors of Virtopsy said it had the potential to revolutionize criminal investigations Basically there will be no such thing as the perfect murder any more because a virtual autopsy allows you to find every piece of evidence he said Virtopsies combine the images from highpowered magnetic resonance imaging MRI computed tomography CT and surface scans of dead bodies Combined the machines are referred to as a Virtobot The technique allows you to find injuries that are not seen during a traditional autopsy as well as air pockets heart attacks and even cancer The Virtopsy might replace the autopsy one day Richard Dirndorfer one of the pioneers of DNA analysis in criminology and a developer of Virtopsy told the German science magazine PM I think well see it happen gradually just like DNA analysis gradually replaced blood group analysis he said The computer imaging techniques allow doctors to see deep inside dead bodies The method has already allowed the discovery of injuries that were not picked up during traditional autopsies At first the aim is to use the new method to complement the traditional autopsy It will allow forensic scientists to plan their autopsies far more efficiently Dominic Wichmann an internal medicine specialist at Hamburgs University Hospital told Spiegel Criminologists from around the world have been travelling to Switzerland over the past few years to see the new method The method had been under development for decades Then a donation from a rich ophthalmologist allowed the project to take off The new generation of forensic scientists and pathologists dont see it as a threat They see it as something that will complement traditional methods and possibly even one day replace them though probably not entirely In order to analyze the colour of the blood the consistencies of body fluids or smells well need to keep on with the traditional cut said Lars Oesterhelweg Deputy Director of the Institute of Forensic Medicine at the Charit Hospital in Berlin which is using a version of the Virtopsy He added that the new method was particularly helpful in reexamining cases where the cause of death was unclear It means that third opinions can be gathered investigations can be reexamined and cases can be reopened he said Scientists using the new method said that relatives of the dead often dont like the idea of autopsies because of the disfigurement they cause They are much happier with the noninvasive

135,Thousands of people protested on Australias beaches against a shark cull in Western Australia They asked the states prime minister to stop the cull and RSPCA Australia and Virgin Atlantic owner Richard Branson criticized it Catching and killing sharks longer than three metres began after a number of shark attacks on Western Australias coast A 35yearold surfer who was killed in November 2013 was the sixth person to die from a shark attack in two years But the whole of Australia has had on average just one sharkrelated death a year for the last 50 years Kate Faehrmann of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society said from a protest in Perth the state capital of Western Australia Weve always said that this idea wont work Drumlines which they use to catch the sharks kill sharks if theyre one two three metres or more and also dolphins turtles and other things Thats why we dont want the cull Thousands of people protested on beaches in the cities of Perth Sydney and Adelaide and at beaches in Victoria and Queensland Faehrmann said the protests showed that Australians wanted sharks to be protected Whats amazing is that so many people in Australia love sharks This has shown that people are scared but thousands of people are coming out across the country to say Thats the sharks ocean We respect them we love them and we dont want you to kill them Anthony Joyce a surfer who once had his foot caught in a sharks mouth said The number of sharks they are going to kill is going to make no difference The state government will not say how many sharks they have killed but some people say that sharks smaller than three metres were released after they were caught on drumlines oating drums xed to the sea bed with bait on hooks underneath them Conservationists say there is no evidence the cull will reduce the number of shark attacks on humans because no other cull has only used drumlines Researchers at the University of Western Australia say the increased number of shark attacks in the state may be because Western Australia has the fastestgrowing population in Australia not because of a rising number of sharks Richard Peirce of the UKbased conservation charity the Shark Trust said that the cull would not work and could bring more predators towards the coast The activity in Western Australia is adding to the human tragedy of shark attacks It is very sad that a government has ignored the best advice and chosen a method that is ineffective and counterproductive he said and even if they monitor drumlines through the day leaving the lines in at night could attract other predators to the area attracted by those sharks and other species hooked and injured Worldwide in 2012 there were 80 attacks by sharks Seven of the attacks were fatal This is compared to nearly 100 million sharks killed by humans each year RSPCA Australia says it believes the cull is wrong There is no evidence that the increase in attacks is a result of increasing shark numbers We think it is the result of a changing population and changing human behaviour that is there are more people in the water it said Richard Branson said the idea was not working Im sure one of the reasons Western Australia Premier Colin Barnett did it was because he was thinking it would encourage tourism Its going to do the opposite I think Youre advertising a problem that doesnt exist in a big way and youre

67,We all know about wildlife emergencies such as the possible extinction of the tiger in India the orangutan in Indonesia and the panda Everybody loves these animals and no one wants to see them disappear But now scientists are worried that the threat to creatures such as ladybirds is a much greater danger to biodiversity Climate change falling numbers of animals rising numbers of humans and extinction mean that more and more scientists now believe that we are in the Anthropocene age the age of extinction A recent report from the World Wildlife Fund WWF confirms that worrying idea statistics from the report show a very big reduction in the numbers of many species The number of vertebrates has declined by 52 over the last forty years We are losing too many species Some populations of mammals birds reptiles and amphibians have reduced even more with freshwater species declining by 76 over the same period But its the creatures that help us the most that are worrying many scientists Three quarters of the worlds food production depends on bees and other insects Pandas are cute and tigers are beautiful but other animals are more useful its worms that turn our waste into nutrients and bats that catch mosquitoes and keep malaria rates down Its the loss of the common species that will affect people The loss of the rarer creatures will not affect us much because were not reliant on them in such an obvious way said Dr Nick Isaac who studies the environment He says that Britains insects and other invertebrates are declining just as fast as vertebrates He says that this will cause serious problems for humans He said that between 23 and 36 of all birds mammals and amphibians that we use for food or medicine might become extinct In many parts of the world wild animals are an important part of the diet particularly for the poor Most people also blame humans humans damage ecosystems create climate change and destroy habitats But this time its not just the big cuddly mammals we have to worry about losing but the smaller creatures that are less easy to see We depend on insects creepycrawlies and even worms They might not become extinct very soon but a decline in their numbers will affect us all We are going to feel the effect of those losses The numbers of both invertebrates and vertebrates are declining Its not so simple as fish die and people starve its more complex said Isaac Humans said TV naturalist Sir David Attenborough in 2013 are a plague on earth But the WWF claims there is still time to stop the decline Its UK Chief Executive David Nussbaum said The amount of destruction shown in this report should make us all change our behaviour We all politicians business and people have a responsibility to protect what we all value a healthy future for people and nature Humans are cutting down too many trees too quickly fishing too many fish taking too much water from our rivers and producing too much carbon he said,We have all become familiar with wildlife emergencies such as the threatened extinction of the tiger in India the orangutan in Indonesia and the panda They are wellloved animals that no one wants to see disappear But now scientists fear the real impact of declining wildlife could be closer to home they believe the threat to creatures such as ladybirds is a much greater danger to biodiversity Climate change falling numbers of animals rising numbers of humans and the rapid rate of species extinction mean more and more scientists now believe that we are in the Anthropocene age the geological age of extinction when humans finally dominate the ecosystems A recent report by the World Wildlife Fund WWF confirmed that worrying picture with statistics on the worlds wildlife population that showed a dramatic reduction in numbers across numerous species The report showed the number of vertebrates had declined by 52 over four decades Biodiversity loss has now reached critical levels Some populations of mammals birds reptiles and amphibians have suffered even bigger losses with freshwater species declining by 76 over the same period But its the creatures that provide the most ecosystem services that are getting many scientists really worried Three quarters of the worlds food production is thought to depend on bees and other pollinators Pandas may be cute and tigers beautiful but its worms that turn our waste into nutrients and bats that catch mosquitoes and keep malaria rates down Its the loss of the common species that will impact on people not so much the rarer creatures because they are so rare were not reliant on them in such an obvious way said macroecologist Dr Nick Isaac He says that recent work he and colleagues have been doing suggests that Britains insects and other invertebrates are declining just as fast as vertebrates with serious consequences for humanity The really interesting thing about this work is that we are learning that its not just about the numbers of species going extinct but the actual numbers in a population thats the beginning of a fundamental shift in our understanding he says He pointed to the fact that between 23 and 36 of all birds mammals and amphibians used for food or medicine are now threatened with extinction In many parts of the world wildanimal food sources are a critical part of the diet particularly for the poor The blame most people agree is unsustainable human consumption damaging ecosystems creating climate change and destroying habitats at a far faster rate than previously thought But this time its not just the big cuddly mammals we have to worry about losing but the smaller less visible creatures upon which we depend insects creepycrawlies and even worms They might not be facing immediate extinction but a decline in their numbers will affect us all We are going to feel the impact of those losses With the UK species the pattern is much the same with invertebrates as it is with vertebrates Its not as simplistic as fish die and people starve its more complex said Isaac Humans said TV naturalist Sir David Attenborough in 2013 are a plague on earth but the WWF claims there is still time to stop the decline Its UK Chief Executive David Nussbaum said The scale of the destruction highlighted in this report should act as a wakeup call for us all We all politicians business and people have an interest and a responsibility to protect what we all value a healthy future for people and nature Humans are cutting down trees more quickly than they can regrow harvesting more fish than the oceans can restock pumping water from our rivers and aquifers faster than rainfall can fill them again and emitting more carbon than the oceans and forests can absorb he said,test,ELE,INT

104,Male bosses are paid bonuses double the size of bonuses given to female colleagues in the same jobs This means that men get bonuses of 141500 more than women over their working lives The numbers released by the Chartered Management Institute CMI show that men in UK management jobs earned average bonuses of 6442 in 2012 compared with 3029 for women Female directors received bonuses of 36270 over the past 12 months compared with 63700 received by male directors The numbers show that pay in British business is still not equal Campaigners believe we must do something to improve equality at work Ann Francke the CMIs chief executive said that there should be more flexibility and less masculine cultures and that the good work people do should be more important than how much time they spend in the office Also there should be more transparency around performance and bonuses If we solve this issue we will improve the performance of organizations and the wellbeing of people at work she said What are we waiting for Some of the numbers may be affected by women doing jobs where there is less of a culture of bonus payments But the differences in the sizes of bonuses do make Britains pay gap worse The government says the pay gap is closing but that fulltime male employees still earn 10 more than women Maria Miller the Minister for Women and Equalities said that the CMI numbers are another example from the world of work that shows that women still earn less than men doing the same job Changes in the workplace are happening and its good that the pay gap is closing but there is still more to do before we see full equality in the workplace The government is trying to help 120 companies have joined our Think Act Report scheme which encourages companies to improve the way they recruit promote and pay women Weve also looked at other causes of the pay gap such as having to juggle work and family Large companies such as Tesco BT Unilever and the international law firm Eversheds are

difference between the average salaries earned by male and female bosses appeared to be smaller than in 2012,Male bosses are paid bonuses double the size of those given to female colleagues in identical jobs This means that men get salary topups of 141500 more than women over their working lives The figures released by the Chartered Management Institute CMI reveal that men in UK management roles earned average bonuses of 6442 in 2012 compared with 3029 for women In the most senior roles female directors received bonuses of 36270 over the past 12 months compared with 63700 awarded to male directors The latest figures show that pay in British business is still not equal This has led to calls for action from campaigners on workplace equality Ann Francke the CMIs chief executive said Its time to move this issue into the mainstream management agenda This is about changing our approach to management There should be greater flexibility less masculine cultures more emphasis on outcomes rather than time in the office and greater transparency around performance and rewards In solving this issue we would actually raise the performance of organizations and the wellbeing of individuals at work What are we waiting for While some of the data may be affected by factors such as women doing jobs where there is less of a culture of bonus payments the differences in the sizes of bonuses do appear to make Britains pay gap worse The government says the pay gap is closing but that fulltime male employees still earn 10 more than women Maria Miller the Minister for Women and Equalities said The CMI figures are another example from the world of work showing that women still lose out to their male counterparts Changes in the workplace are happening and its good that the pay gap is closing but there is still more to do before we see full equality in the workplace The government is playing its part We have signed up 120 companies to our Think Act Report scheme which encourages companies to improve the way they recruit promote and pay women Weve also looked at other pay gap causes such as having to juggle work and family responsibilities We have introduced shared parental leave and the right to request flexible working to all employees Large companies such as Tesco BT Unilever and the international law firm Eversheds are among those signed up to Think Act

94,A car with a maximum speed of 25 miles per hour two seats and no pedals or steering wheel does not sound very interesting But Google in the US shocked the car and taxi industries when it unveiled the latest version of its driverless car Google has begun testing the electric car at its headquarters in Mountain View California The car does not have all the normal car controls such as foot pedals Instead it has a smartphone app that calls it and tells it the destination and a STOP button between the two seats in case the passengers need to override the computer The company is building about 100 prototypes for a twoyear test The companys cofounder Sergey Brin said that the vehicle was still just a prototype He says that they want to change the world for people who do not find it easy to travel around Talking about the car he said Youre just sitting there no steering wheel no pedals For me it was very relaxing About ten seconds after getting into the car I forgot I was there I found it really fun Google says that the aim of the project is to improve safety They say that the car is made with foam at the front and a plastic windscreen so it should be far safer than any other car for pedestrians The cars have been built specially by a company in Detroit Google will now test the cars which are not yet for sale There need to be detailed scans of the roads before the cars can drive on them because they cannot collect and process enough information in real time So far there are detailed maps of about 2000 miles of Californias roads but California has more than 170000 miles of roads Google says it wants to license the technology to traditional car makers when they have improved it But the idea that driverless cars will replace taxis with human drivers has alarmed some people Dennis Conyon from the UK National Taxi Association said that taxi drivers will become unemployed London has about 22000 black taxis and Conyon thinks that the total number of people who drive taxis in the UK is about 100000 Other car makers including Volvo Ford and Mercedes are going to make vehicles that will be different from Googles version because they will have driver controls But Chris Urmson director of the driverless car project at Google said that the new prototypes do not have a steering wheel or brakes because a human passenger might not be able to take control in an emergency He said that it was simpler just to have an emergency stop button Urmson said The vehicles will be very basic But they will take you where you want to go at the push of a button And thats an important step towards improving road safety and helping millions of people travel around more easily So far the Google versions of the driverless cars have driven 700000 miles without an accident caused by the computer The company says that thousands of people die each year on the roads and that about 80 of crashes are caused by human mistakes,A car with a top speed of 25mph two seats and no pedals or steering wheel might not make much of an impression at a motor show But Google in the US sent a shock through the car and taxi industries as it unveiled the latest version of its driverless car The electrically powered vehicle which Google has begun testing around its headquarters in Mountain View California dispenses with all the normal controls including foot pedals Instead it has a smartphone app that calls it and tells it the destination and a single STOP button between the two frontfacing seats in case the passengers need to override the computer The car in fact does all the tasks of navigation steering acceleration and braking The company is building about 100 prototypes for a twoyear test The companys cofounder Sergey Brin told a conference in California that the vehicle was still in the prototype stage but that the project was about changing the world for people who do not have good transportation today He said of the car Youre just sitting there no steering wheel no pedals For me it was very relaxing About ten seconds after getting in I forgot I was there I found it really enjoyable Google says that the aim of the project is to improve safety and that because the car is constructed with impactabsorbing foam at the front and a plastic windscreen it should be far safer than any other car for pedestrians The cars which have been built specially by an unnamed company in Detroit will be used to find out how best to make driverless vehicles work Google will run a pilot programme using the cars which are not yet for sale One challenge is creating highdefinition scans of the roads and surroundings before the cars can drive along them because they cannot collect and process enough information in real time So far there are highdetail maps of about 2000 miles of Californias roads but the state has more than 170000 miles of public roads Google says it is interested in licensing the technology to traditional vehicle manufacturers once it has been refined But the idea of driverless cars replacing humandriven taxis has been the cause of some alarm Dennis Conyon of the UK National Taxi Association says that drivers will become unemployed London has about 22000 licensed black cabs and Conyon estimates that the total number of people who drive taxis for hire in the UK is about 100000 Other car makers including Volvo Ford and Mercedes are working on driverassisted vehicles which unlike Googles version do not dispense with the driver controls But Chris Urmson director of the selfdriving car project at Google said that the new prototypes dispensed with the steering wheel and brakes because a human passenger might not be able to take over in an emergency and that it was simpler just to have an emergency stop button Urmson

41,Tua Pittman from Raratonga in the Cook Islands is a traditional navigator To him a canoe is more than just a form of transport The canoe is our island the crew is the community and the navigator is the leader he says On a canoe you are not just going from one place to another using the stars the moon the sun and the birds Navigation is showing your crew the light of life It has been a busy week for the crews of four sailing canoes they are in Sydney for the start of the World Parks Congress Tuas journey began at the Cook Islands on 25 September The islanders sailed to Samoa then Fiji Vanuatu and onto the Gold Coast Then they travelled south to Sydney Around 100 crew were involved in the voyage and they tried to travel using only traditional navigation techniques Sadly said Tua the crews had to use modern navigation equipment sometimes to reach Australia in time for the Congress The trip is called the Mua Voyage It is a partnership between the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN Oceania Regional Of ce and ve Paci c Island countries Samoa Tonga New Zealand the Cook Islands and Fiji The main aim of the 11000km trip was to deliver a special message to the World Parks Congress The message said We see fewer sh than in the past and they are smaller And foreign sherman take our sh Our coral reefs the greatest in the world and our shing grounds are disappearing Our ocean is very big but not limitless The Paci c Islanders message to the delegates of the Congress was urgent But a lot of time has been spent at the Congress trying to set a new target for the amount of the ocean that needs special protection According to the IUCN in 2013 less than three per cent of the worlds oceans was in marine protected areas and less than one per cent of that is no take no shing But there should be a lot more notake areas because the last World Parks Congress in 2003 set a target of 2030 After dif cult talks the World Parks Congress agreed new targets for marine protected areas The new target is not 2030 it is at least 30 And they must try to solve the problem of biodiversity Tua Pittman is very happy with what the Congress has decided for the worlds oceans Its a huge reward for all the effort that we made to be here To hear they made that decision is fantastic Its a step in the right direction He is 55 and in his lifetime he can already see that it is much harder to catch sh He also said that pollution is getting worse particularly close to big cities such as Sydney And climate change is already having a serious effect on Paci c Islanders The decisions of the big countries have a small effect on developed large countries but they have a very big effect on small countries The Mua Voyage had taken years of preparation and planning It was critical to the voyagers that the world listened to their message and took action Pittman said that the leaders of rich countries should think more like traditional navigators who see that their boats are just tiny specks in an enormous sea Most importantly Tua says that politicians must change how they do things The world needs to nd a different path The Mua Voyage had taken years of preparation and planning It was critical to the voyagers that the world listened to their message and took action Pittman said that the leaders of rich countries should think more like traditional navigators who

Pittman says He continues On a canoe you are not just going from one destination to another using the stars the moon the sun and the birds Navigation is using the philosophies of being a leader to show your crew members the light of life It has been a busy week for the crews of four sailing canoes since arriving in Sydney for the start of the World Parks Congress Tuas journey began at the Cook Islands on 25 September The islanders sailed to Samoa then Fiji Vanuatu and onto the Gold Coast before sailing south to Sydney Around 100 crew members were involved in the voyage and they aimed to travel using only traditional navigation techniques Unfortunately said Tua the crews had to rely on modern navigation equipment at times to reach Australia in time for the Congress The of cial title of the expedition is the Mua Voyage It is a partnership between the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN Oceania Regional Of ce and ve Paci c Island countries Samoa Tonga New Zealand the Cook Islands and Fiji The main goal of the 6000nauticalmile 11000km trip was to deliver a special message to the World Parks Congress The message said We see the signs of overexploitation We no longer see the sh and other marine creatures in the size diversity or abundance of the past We witness the change as foreign shing eets take our resources Our coral reefs the greatest in the world and our spawning grounds are disappearing Our ocean is vast but not limitless Growing global populations and unsustainable development are reducing the ability of our ocean to sustain life The Paci c Islanders have put a lot of effort into their urgent message to the delegates of the Congress But despite this the Congress has spent much of its time trying to set a revised target for the amount of the ocean that needs to be protected in marine sanctuaries According to the IUCN in 2013 the amount of the worlds oceans in marine protected areas was not even three per cent and less than one per cent of that is no take no shing This was despite a target of 2030 notake areas set by the last World Parks Congress in 2003 Marine scientist Professor Callum Roberts was one of the scientists who helped set the 2030 target in 2003 But he said it was not enough The IUCN should now lift its target from 30 to 33 New research shows that we need to raise the 30 target Any reduction in efforts at this stage and moment in history would be disastrous for our oceans After dif cult negotiations the World Parks Congress delegates passed a motion that will dramatically change the goals for global marine management Instead of the 2030 target the IUCN now says that each marine habitat should include strictly protected areas of at least 30 These areas should address both biodiversity and ecosystem services Tua Pittman was delighted with the news that a strong resolution on the planets oceans had passed the Congress Its a huge reward for all the effort that we made to be here and to be heard To hear they made that resolution is fantastic Its a step in the right direction He said he was 55 and in his lifetime he was already beginning to see that it was much harder to catch sh on the open ocean He also said that pollution was getting worse particularly as the canoes approached big cities such as Sydney And climate change is already beginning to have a serious effect on Paci c Islanders The decisions of the big countries impact on the small countries twice three times four times more than they impact on developed large nations The Mua Voyage had been a massive logistical undertaking said Tua Years of preparation and navigational planning went into such a trip and it was critical to the voyagers that the world listened to their message and acted He said that the leaders of wealthy countries need to start to think more like traditional navigators who recognize that their boats are just specks in an enormous sea Most importantly and spoken like a true navigator

says If you need to go out and talk to a friend a girl or a boy you come to Inzozi Nziza for an ice cream Most of the ingredients are from local sources and the milk comes from nearby Nyanza The vanilla beans and cocoa are imported Inzozi Nziza was opened by the theatre director Odile Gakire Katese She met Alexis Miesen and Jennie Dundas cofounders of Blue Marble Ice Cream in Brooklyn New York and formed a partnership to open the shop in 2010 An icecream shop Katese said might help to put the human pieces back together by rebuilding spirits hopes and family traditions Miesen says At the start Miesen and Dundas owned the shop in partnership with its staff and had shares in the business which is a cooperative and nonpro t After 18 months they transferred their shares to the women who had by then proved they could run the business Ice cream is new to Rwanda Making the business successful requires a lot of skills and changing peoples way of thinking because selling and eating ice cream is not part of Rwandan culture The Butare shop employs nine women who spend their spare time practising with Ingoma Nshya Rwandas rst and only female drumming group which was established by Katese ten years ago The musicians are Hutu and Tutsi women Some are survivors of the 1994 genocide during which almost a million Tutsis and Hutus were killed Some members of Ingoma Nshya are widows some orphans Historically says Ingabire Rwandan women were forbidden to drum and many people considered the drums too heavy for women to carry But its something which brings unity Ingabires father two siblings and many cousins were killed in the genocide When Im drumming it gives me power because were still alive and survivors she says The icecream parlour is in a documentary by lmmakers Rob and Lisa Fruchtman Sweet Dreams which tells the story of how the women have made a promising postgenocide future also includes the female drummers The lm has been shown in more than a dozen countries including the US UK and several African states We feel the lm is about resilience hope bravery resourcefulness and the ability to change the course of your own life says Lisa Fruchtman,test,ELE,INT
10,John Lewiss 2015 Christmas advert shows a lonely old man who lives on the moon Department store John Lewiss Christmas ad which for many people shows that the Christmas shopping season has begun aims to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds for the charity Age UK John Lewis will also encourage staff and customers to care for elderly people who might be alone over the holiday The department store has spent 7 million on a campaign that includes the TV ad a smartphone game and merchandise including glowinthedark pyjamas It has also built areas that look like the surface of the moon in 11 of its stores After two years of successful ads with cute animals a bear and hare then a penguin this time the story is about a young girl Lily who sees an old man living in a small wooden house on the moon through her telescope The girl tries to send him a letter and a note via bow and arrow Then she floats him a present of a telescope tied to balloons This helps them to make contact The ads message is Show someone theyre loved this Christmas This is similar to Age UKs campaign No one should have no one at Christmas Profits from three products a mug gift tag and card will go to the charity Rachel Swift head of marketing at John Lewis said that people talk about charities at Christmas and the ad makes you think about someone who lives on your street that might not see anybody The campaign features the Oasis track Half the World Away sung by Norwegian singer Aurora The ad cost 1 million to make The moon scenes were shot at the Warner Bros Studios where the Harry Potter films were made and the specially built set was created by one of the team behind the latest Star Wars film The Force Awakens As in the last few years John Lewis showed a short film on TV and social media using the hashtag OnTheMoon before it showed the full advert There will be a full moon on Christmas Day 2015 a complete coincidence says Swift In 2014 the department store also spent 7 million on a campaign with a penguin and a young boy playing together It had 22 million views on YouTube by the first week of January more than the 166m views of Sainsburys ad with First World War soldiers sharing a bar of chocolate the UKs second most popular ad of 2014 Swift said that John Lewis wants to just get something right for the company at this time of year and do something we hope customers really love Sarah Vizard from Marketing Week said There are a lot more companies doing Christmas ads this year but I think a lot of those companies just show what you can buy in store John Lewis does the emotional piece the best I think people will think the ad is really cute,A lonely old man living on the moon is the unusual focus of John Lewiss 2015 Christmas advert There is increasing hype around John Lewiss seasonal ad which has come to mark the beginning of the Christmas shopping season for many The department store will aim to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds for Age UK It will also encourage staff and customers to join up with their local branch of the charity to care for elderly people who might be alone over the holiday The department store has spent 7m on a campaign that ranges from the TV ad to a smartphone game and merchandise including glowinthedark pyjamas as well as making areas that look like the surface of the moon in 11 of their stores After two years of successful ads with cuddly animals a bear and hare then a penguin this time the store is tugging at the heartstrings with a story of a young girl Lily who spots an old man living in a shack on the moon through her telescope The determined child tries sending him a letter and firing a note via bow and arrow before floating him a present of a telescope tied to balloons which finally allows them to make contact The ads message is Show someone theyre loved this Christmas which echoes Age UKs own campaign No one should have no one at Christmas Profits from three products a mug gift tag and card will go to the charity Rachel Swift head of marketing at John Lewis said that people talk about the charity at this time of year and the ad makes you think about someone who lives on your street that

where the Harry Potter films were made and the specially built set was created by one of the team behind the latest Star Wars film The Force Awakens As in the last few years John Lewis has drummed up interest in their most recent ad with a teaser campaign on TV and social media using the hashtag OnTheMoon A full moon will fall on Christmas Day 2015 a complete coincidence according to Swift In 2014 the retailer also spent 7m on a campaign with a realistic animated penguin and a young boy playing together to the tune of John Lennons Real Love sung by British singersongwriter Tom Odell It had drummed up 22m views on YouTube by the first week of January more than the 166m views of Sainsburys ad with First World War soldiers sharing a bar of chocolate the UKs second most popular ad of 2014 Swift said that despite the hype John Lewis had kept the same strategy for the last five years Its all about thoughtful gifting and going the extra mile for someone you love at Christmas she said We dont go into it thinking This is going to be huge just getting something right for the brand at this time of year and something we hope customers really love Sarah Vizard news editor of trade journal Marketing Week said John Lewis appeared to have simplified efforts this time with a lowerkey presence in stores despite a growing number of competitors There are definitely a lot more brands doing Christmas ads this year but I think a lot of those brands who tried to compete with John Lewis by doing something emotional and creative have gone back to what you can buy in store she said John Lewis still does the emotional piece the best This campaign is another great way of communicating that in a way that customers can relate to I think people will think it is really cute,test,ELE,INT
24,On average a girl born today in the UK will live to the age of nearly 82 and her brother will live to 78 They would have a longer life in Andorra the girl 85 and the boy 79 but will live a little longer than in the US 81 and 76 If they lived in the Central African Republic they would die in middle age 49 and 44 Almost everywhere in the world except countries such as Lesotho which have problems with HIV and violence life expectancy is increasing The best news is that small children die much less often than forty years ago There has been a reduction in deaths of underfives of nearly 60 from 164 million in 1970 to 68 million in 2010 Over the past five years the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation IHME in Seattle has led a very big project to look at the global effects of disease If we know how many children die and why the world can try to keep them alive The big IHME database will help global organizations and governments to better care for us all The project has been controversial IHME has been very radical in some of its methods When they didnt have death registries or medical records they decided the cause of death by an interview with the family called a verbal autopsy The most surprising result has been with malaria IHME said 12 million die of the disease every year this is twice as many as people believed The big increase is in adult deaths It is commonly believed that malaria kills mostly children under five We are taught as doctors that in areas with malaria you become semiimmune as an adult said Dr Christopher Murray IHME Director But he says the evidence tells them that may not be right African doctors write on hospital records that adults are dying of malaria a lot But their fever could be something different he adds The results have led to more studies Although the Director General of the World Health Organization was happy about the IHME study other people are not so sure We need to be very careful said Colin Mathers a senior scientist He thinks scientists need to find out if the numbers are correct One of the most important things in the study said Murray was the very fast change in the main causes of death and the speed of that change is a lot faster than we thought Reduced fertility and longer life have led to an increase in the average age of the worlds population in ten years from 26 years old to almost 30 The change has been dramatic in Latin America for example where countries like Brazil and Paraguay had life expectancy of below 30 in 1970 and almost 64 in 2010 That is a 35year increase in the average age of death in forty years Also important is the change outside Africa from communicable diseases to lifestyle diseases such as heart disease stroke diabetes and cancer That change is very obvious in Latin America the Middle East and southeast and even south Asia Murray said The third big result was he said a surprise to us The study showed that there are lots of people with disabilities and it has a big effect on people who are living longer but not healthier lives The main causes of disability are different from the ones that kill you he said They were mental health problems such as anxiety and depression disorders such as arthritis and lower back pain anaemia sight and hearing loss and skin disease Also there was drug abuse The number of people with these problems is not reducing over time he said We are making no progress in reducing these problems,A girl born today in the UK can expect to live nearly to the age of 82 on average and her brother will live to 78 They would have a longer life in Andorra 85 and 79 respectively but will live a little longer than in the US 81 and 76 If they lived in the Central African Republic they would die in middle age 49 and 44 However almost everywhere in the world with the exception of countries such as Lesotho which have experienced HIV and violence lifespans are lengthening And the best news is that small children are much less likely to die than they were forty years ago There has been a drop in deaths in underfives of nearly 60 from 164 million in 1970 to 68 million in 2010 This last statistic provides justification for the enormous project that the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation IHME in Seattle has led over the past five years involving nearly 500 researchers to assess the global effects of disease Knowing how many children die and from what cause allows the world to focus its efforts and resources on keeping them alive There are many lessons to be learnt from the enormous database they have put together which will help global organizations and individual governments to better care for us all The project was a big task and is not without controversy IHME has been very radical in some of its methods Where they did not have death registries or medical records for instance they have taken evidence from verbal autopsies deciding the cause of death by an interview with the family The most surprising result has been the malaria figure IHME said 12 million die of the disease every year twice as many as previously thought The big increase is in adult deaths It is commonly believed that malaria kills mostly children under five The way I was taught as a doctor and everybody else is taught is that in malarial areas you become semiimmune as an adult said Dr Christopher Murray IHME Director We originally went with that opinion but there has been a change as we have become more empirical following the data African doctors write on hospital records that adults are dying of malaria a lot But he adds their fever could be something else The findings have led to further studies Although Margaret Chan Director General of the World Health Organization gave the IHME study a warm official welcome some of the staff are cautious We need to be very careful in assessing the validity of the figures said Colin Mathers a senior scientist We need to wait to be persuaded by evidence His colleague Dr Tiers Boerma Director of one WHO department added People should understand that some of the numbers are very different and the WHO cant go with any academic publication that states a different number However said Mathers IHME has pushed the envelope with some of these analyses and that is stimulating One of the main themes said Murray was incredibly rapid change in the main causes of death and the speed of that change is a lot faster than we expected it to be Reduced fertility and longer life have led to a rise in the average age of the worlds population in a decade from 26 years old to almost 30 The change has been dramatic in Latin America for instance where countries like Brazil and Paraguay had life expectancy of below 30 in 1970 and almost 64 in 2010 That is a 35year increase in the average age of death over four decades In a place like Brazil the speed of change is so fast that most institutions are not able to deal with it Murray said A second factor is the move outside Africa from communicable diseases and the common causes of mother and baby deaths to what are sometimes termed lifestyle diseases such as heart disease stroke diabetes and cancer some of which have significant genetic triggers That change has been particularly marked in Latin America the Middle East and southeast and even south Asia he said The third big finding was Murray said a surprise to us There is a lot of disability and it has a big effect on people who are living longer but not healthier lives The main causes of disability are different from the ones that kill you he said They were mental health problems such as anxiety and depression and disorders such as arthritis and lower back pain anaemia sight and hearing loss and skin disease In addition there was substance abuse The numbers for these are not going down over time he said We are making no progress in reducing these conditions,test,ELE,INT
83,The Chief Medical Officer for England compared the problem of antibiotic resistance to the risks of international terrorism But each year the number of deaths around the world from bacterial resistance is far more than the number of deaths from terrorist attacks The World Health Organization says that each year more than 150000 people die from tuberculosis because of antibiotic resistance This is now a war A hundred years ago life expectancy in the UK was about 47 years for a man and 50 years for a woman Lots of young children died About 30 of all deaths were in children under the age of five mostly because of infectious disease But a child born in Britain today has more than a 25 chance of reaching their 100th birthday We can thank public health systems vaccination and antibiotics for this In intensive care antibiotic resistant bacteria are most common Here powerful antibiotics are used very often These drugs kill ordinary bacteria But they cannot kill strong bacteria that have begun to learn how to survive antibiotic drugs When I became a doctor in the 1990s I learnt about Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus MRSA is a bacteria that is resistant to methicillin and all other penicillins There were just a few drugs that could kill it for example vancomycin and teicoplanin But antibiotic resistant bacteria became more and more common In our hospitals and our doctors surgeries we use antiobiotics too often Also we have put antibiotics into the food chain when we grow food and when we put antibacterial drugs into food for farm animals We thought that antibiotics were something we could use forever We thought that companies would continue to make more and more antibiotics But this is no longer true We have found new more resistant bacteria The vancomycin that we used to treat MRSA infection no longer worked We found Vancomycin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus VRSA in our hospitals And other bacteria were becoming resistant too Today infections with organisms that are very resistant are common but fewer and fewer new antibiotic drugs are made It is more and more difficult to develop new drugs that can kill resistant bacteria Antibiotics have become drugs that are expensive to develop that are only used in short courses and that quickly stop working because of bacterial resistance This war against bacteria is different from all other wars There needs to be change in the way doctors give antibiotics and we need to use fewer antibiotics in farming And we have to give companies good reasons why they should make new antibiotics which will not make them lots of money Today antibiotic resistance has become a normal part of life Less than a hundred years after the discovery of penicillin we are beginning to lose the fight,The Chief Medical Officer for England has compared the problem of antibiotic resistance to the risks of international terrorism But in fact each year the global number of deaths caused by bacterial resistance is far more than the number of deaths caused by terrorist attacks The World Health Organization estimates that just for tuberculosis multidrug resistance kills more than 150000 people each year Antibiotic resistance is now a real risk this is now a war In the past hundred years our expectations of life and survival have changed beyond all recognition At the beginning of the twentieth century life expectancy in the UK was around 47 years of age for a man and 50 for a woman a number heavily affected by the very high rate of infant mortality in those days Around a third of all deaths were in children under the age of five mostly because of infectious disease However a child born in Britain today has more than a one in four chance of reaching their 100th birthday For this we have public health systems vaccination and antibiotics to thank It is thanks to this the prevention and treatment of illnesses caused by microorganisms that the real war against disease is mainly won It is in intensive care my specialist area that antibiotic resistant organisms are most common Here powerful antibiotics essential in the treatment of lifethreatening illness are used routinely These drugs kill ordinary bacteria But they leave behind strong bacteria that have begun to learn how to survive antibiotic drugs As a newly qualified doctor in the late 1990s I learnt about Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus the infamous MRSA a bacterial species resistant to methicillin and all other penicillins In the fight against it there were a small number of drugs like vancomycin and teicoplanin These were supposed to be our defence but antibiotic resistant bacteria became more and more common bacteria with new kinds of resistance became more common too Drugs we had previously hardly heard of became common We got used to this a slow increase in the arms race between us and the bacteria But the balance has been slowly moving In our hospitals and our GP surgeries we have abused the drugs that gave us such a huge advantage over infectious disease we use them too often And some of the worst abuses have happened outside of healthcare with antibiotics introduced into the food chain through agriculture and by putting antibacterial drugs into food for farm animals We thought that antibiotic therapy was an advantage we could enjoy forever We became complacent that the pharmaceutical industry would continue to stay ahead of the game But this is no longer the case New more resistant species have been found The vancomycin that we used to treat MRSA infection no longer worked Vancomycin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus VRSA appeared in our hospitals And other bacteria were learning resistance Enterobacteria also became resistant to vancomycin Today infections with highly resistant organisms are common and the pharmaceutical industry is not keeping up Fewer and fewer new antimicrobial drugs are produced It is becoming more and more difficult to develop new drugs that work against resistant bacteria For every method of attack the pharmaceutical companies invent bacteria quickly form a defence We have tried all of the simple approaches to the problem Antibiotics have become drugs that are expensive to develop that are only used in short courses and that quickly become ineffective due to the changes in bacterial resistance As a result the pharmaceutical industrys incentive to create new drugs that can fight them is low Antibiotics became common in the 1940s and almost straight away we saw the first evidence of bacteria resistance Today this has become a normal part of medical life Less than a century after the discovery of penicillin we are beginning to lose the fight Since the first MRSA deaths in healthy children in the US in 1998 the number of deaths from MRSA infection in the US each year has increased to tens of thousands far more than the number of deaths caused by AIDS Bacterial resistance in hospitals is everywhere This is a war different from any other There needs to be change in the way doctors prescribe antibiotics and fewer antibiotics used in farming and agriculture And we have to find a way to convince the pharmaceutical companies to develop these less profitable drugs If we are going to avoid a return to the preantibiotic time with all its excess mortality we must make some big changes To lose the advantage we have against microorganisms in the fight for life would be unthinkable,test,ELE,INT

138,Our new international survey including 33 countries shows how wrong people around the world are about some important things British people think the richest 1 own 59 of their countrys wealth when they actually only own 23 Americans think that 33 of their population are immigrants but it is really only 14 Brazilians think the average age in their country is 56 when it is only 31 Russians think that 31 of their politicians are women when it is only 14 In Britain people think that 43 of young adults aged 2534 still live at home with their parents rather than the actual 14 In India people who did the online survey think 60 of the whole country also has internet access when really only 19 do So why do people across the world know so little about these things Some of us dont understand the questions For example most countries overestimate how many people are not religious in the 33 countries people thought 37 are not religious but the real number is actually just 18 This is because we are thinking of how many people practise their religion rather than how many people say they have a religion Rural areas are large so that is why people overestimate how many people live in the countryside We see things from our own perspective and nd it dif cult to imagine that there is a lot of variety in our countries For example the people from India who did the survey really overestimated their populations access to the internet Most people did the study online and in developing countries this means the people who did the survey were probably wealthy What we found from the survey is that people generalize from their own situations and forget that other peoples situations might be different In Britain this is probably the reason why people overestimated how much the richest people own how many young people are still living at home and what proportion of the population are immigrants the guess is 25 when it is really only 13 People are worried about these things and because of this they overestimate But the survey suggests there are also some problems that people are not very worried about but they should be more worried For example most countries really underestimate how much of their population is overweight The worst case is Saudi Arabia where people think only 28 are overweight when 71 are Britons think it is 44 when actually 62 are overweight In many ways it is the differences between countries that are the most interesting and important aspects of the study The top 1 in Russia own 70 of the nations wealth while the top 1 in New Zealand only own 18 Half of Italians aged 2534 still live with their parents but only 4 in Norway The average age in India is 27 it is 47 in Japan Only 10 of politicians are women in Brazil Hungary and Japan when 44 are in Sweden When the reality is so strange and varied it is not surprising that were often so wrong,Our new international survey across 33 countries shows how wrong people around the world are about key social realities British people think the top 1 wealthiest households own 59 of their countrys wealth when they actually only own 23 Americans think that 33 of their population are immigrants when in fact it is only 14 Brazilians think the average age in their country is 56 when it is only 31 Russians think that 31 of their politicians are women when it is only 14 In Britain people think that 43 of young adults aged 2534 still live at home with their parents rather than the actual 14 In India the online population think 60 of the whole country also has internet access when in fact only 19 do Why are people across the world so often clueless about these realities It is partly that we just struggle with basic maths and some of us clearly misunderstand the questions or interpret them differently For example most countries hugely overestimate how many people are not religious across the 33 countries respondents think that 37 are not religious but the average is actually just 18 This is because we are thinking of how many people practise their religion rather than how many people see themselves as having a religion People also take mental shortcuts where they take easily available information even if it doesnt quite t the question Our huge overestimates of the rural populations in most countries will be affected by how large rural areas are rather than a careful calculation of how many people live in them In Daniel Kahnemans terms answers to these sorts of questions are classic examples of fast thinking rather than slow We see things from our own perspective and struggle to imagine the variety in our countries This was highlighted by our Indian respondents who massively overestimated their populations access to the internet Our study was mostly carried out through an online survey and in developing countries this will be representative of a more wealthy connected group rather than the general population What we nd throughout the study is that people generalize from their own situations and forget how unrepresentative they are We suffer from what social psychologists call emotional innumeracy when we are estimating realities this means we are sending a message about what is worrying us as much as trying to get the right answers For Britain worries are part of the explanation for peoples huge overestimates of how much the wealthiest own how many young people are still living at home and what proportion of the population are immigrants the guess is 25 when it is really only 13 People are worried about these things and because of this they overestimate how big the problems are But the survey suggests there are also some issues where people are not as worried as they should be For example most countries hugely underestimate how much of their population is overweight or obese The worst case is Saudi Arabia where people think only 28 are when 71 are Britons think it is 44 when it is actually nearly half as much again 62 are either overweight or obese And in many ways it is not our misperceptions but these realities across different countries that are the most interesting and important aspects of the study The top 1 in Russia own 70 of the nations wealth while the top 1 in New Zealand only own 18 Half of Italians aged 2534 still live with their parents when it is only 4 in Norway The average age in India is 27 it is 47 in Japan Only 10 of politicians are women in Brazil Hungary and Japan when 44 are in Sweden When the reality is so strange and varied it is no wonder were so
