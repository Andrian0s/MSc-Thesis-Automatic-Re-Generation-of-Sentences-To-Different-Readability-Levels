34,For 85 years it was just a grey blob on classroom maps of the solar system But on 15 July Pluto was seen in high resolution for the first time The images show dramatic mountain ranges made from solid water ice as big as the Alps or the Rockies The extraordinary images of the former ninth planet and its large moon Charon were sent back 4bn miles to Earth from the New Horizons spacecraft They are the climax of a mission that has been quietly underway for nearly ten years Alan Stern the missions principal investigator said New Horizons is returning amazing results The data look absolutely gorgeous and Pluto and Charon are just mindblowing One of the biggest surprises was the discovery that there are mountains in the Kuiper belt the solar systems mysterious third zone where Pluto is with about 100000 smaller icy objects John Spencer a mission scientist said the mountains appear to be around 3000 metres high and several hundred miles across The detailed image of one edge of the dwarf planet showed not a single crater This tells scientists that there has been recent geological activity on the surface which could include dramatic geysers throwing ice into the atmosphere or cryovolcanoes that erupt in explosions of ice Pluto used to be the ninth planet but since 2006 it has been known as a dwarf planet The NASA press conference began with spectacular images of the sun and the eight official planets Weve brought what was previously a blurred point of light into focus said Dwayne Brown NASA spokesman as scientists and journalists waited for the image to be shown Stern said that there would be many more images and that we would learn a lot more about the planet during the coming year The images have already produced some surprises Scientists believe the mountains are made from water ice with just a thin cover of exotic ices methane and nitrogen Water ice is strong enough to hold up big mountains and thats what we think we can see here This is the first time weve seen this The methane and nitrogen are just a coating The mountains on Pluto probably formed no more than 100m years ago extremely recently in the 456bnyearold solar system This suggests the region which covers about 1 of Plutos surface may still be geologically active The images are the first to show ice mountains except those found on the moons of giant planets The images are so detailed that if the craft were flying over London we would be able to see the runways at Heathrow airport The distance to Pluto 5bn km means it takes New Horizons hours to send back a picture and it will take 16 months to send back all the data The team also announced that the heartshaped feature visible on Pluto will now be known as the Tombaugh Regio after Clyde Tombaugh who discovered the dwarf planet in 1930 The new view of Charon reveals an area of cliffs stretching about 1000km This suggests cracks in Charons surface which could also be the result of geological activity The image also shows a dramatic canyon about 7 to 9km deep Cathy Olkin a mission scientist said Charon just blew our socks off when we saw the new image today The team has just been abuzz There is so much interesting science in this one image alone Scientists think that Pluto is two thirds rock surrounded by a lot of ice with surface temperatures of about minus 230C As the 460m mission continues into the Kuiper belt scientists hope that it will help us to see and understand more of the ancient solar system and the origins of planets It may even help to explain the formation of the Earth itself Andrew Coates head of planetary science at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory said These Kuiper belt objects are the building blocks of the outer solar system Theyre all very cold its like a cosmic deep freeze Its the best way of preserving solar system history That is what is so fascinating about this Its a really thrilling time for solar system exploration In August 2015 mission scientists will choose which of two objects to visit next NASA estimates that the spacecraft will be able to keep recording and sending back data until the mid2030s Then its plutonium power source will run out and it will drift outwards towards the edge of the solar system and deep space New Horizons also observed the smaller members of the Pluto system which includes four other moons Nix Hydra Styx and Kerberos New Horizons is a true mission of exploration showing us why basic scientific research is so important said John Grunsfeld associate administrator for NASAs Science Mission Directorate The images also suggest that Hydras surface is probably coated with water ice Future images will reveal more clues about the formation of this and the other moon billions of years ago,For 85 years it was

129,When two people from the Marshall Islands saw a small fibreglass boat washed up on the beach of a remote Pacific island they decided to take a closer look Inside the boat they found an emaciated man with long hair and a beard who said he had been drifting for 16 months after setting out from Mexico more than 12500km away The man dressed only in a pair of underpants told his rescuers that he had been adrift in the 73metre fibreglass boat whose engines were missing their propellers since he left Mexico for El Salvador in September 2012 A companion had died at sea several months before he said His condition isnt good but hes getting better said Ola Fjeldstad a Norwegian anthropology student doing research on Ebon Island one of the Marshall Islands The man said his name was Jos Ivan and that he survived by catching turtles and birds with his bare hands There was no fishing equipment on the boat but a turtle was inside when it washed up The boat looks like it has been in the water for a long time Fjeldstad told reporters According to Fjeldstad the islanders who found the man took him to a nearby island which is so remote it has only one phone line and no internet to meet the mayor Ione de Brum The mayor contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Majuro the Marshall Islands capital Officials at the ministry said that they were waiting for more details and expected the man to be taken to the capital Officials are considering sending a boat to pick up the castaway Hes staying at the local council house and a family is feeding him said Fjeldstad who added that the man had a basic health check and was found to have low blood pressure but did not appear to have any lifethreatening conditions and was able to walk Weve been giving him a lot of water and hes gaining strength Fraser Christian who teaches maritime survival courses said the mans story if true would be remarkable but not unique It was possible to catch turtles or small fish by hand he said since they are inquisitive and they will approach a small boat to shelter underneath it Christian advises people who are forced to eat turtles to start with their eyes lots of fluid then move on to the blood The major dangers castaways experience are exposure and dehydration The basic rule is no water no food You need water to digest protein If you have no fresh water and it doesnt rain for a few days so you cant collect rainwater you have basically had it Individual physiology was also important with some people more able to survive than others Stories of survival in the vast Pacific Ocean are not uncommon In 2006 three Mexicans made international headlines when they were discovered drifting also in a small fibreglass boat near the Marshall Islands They said they had survived for nine months at sea on a diet of rainwater raw fish and seabirds But Cliff Downing who teaches sea survival to sailors said he was sceptical about the latest tale It just doesnt sound right to me There are 1001 hazards that would make his survival for so long very unlikely,When two people on a remote Pacific island saw a small boat washed up on the beach they decided to take a closer look Inside the boat

161,Loneliness has finally become a hot topic The Office for National Statistics has found Britain to be the loneliest place in Europe British people are less likely to have strong friendships or know their neighbours than people anywhere else in the European Union And research at the University of Chicago has found that loneliness is twice as bad for older peoples health as obesity and almost as great a cause of death as poverty This is shocking but such studies do not examine the loneliness epidemic among younger adults In 2010 the Mental Health Foundation found that loneliness was a greater concern among young people than among the elderly The 18 to 34yearolds surveyed were more likely to feel lonely often to worry about feeling alone and to feel depressed because of loneliness than the over55s Loneliness is a recognized problem among the elderly and there are day centres and charities to help them says Sam Challis of the mental health charity Mind but when young people reach 21 theyre too old for youth services This is problematic because of the close relationship between loneliness and mental health it is linked to increased stress depression paranoia anxiety addiction and it is a known cause of suicide But what can young people do to prevent loneliness One researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute points out that social media and the internet can be both a good thing and a problem They are beneficial when they enable us to communicate with distant loved ones but not when they replace facetoface contact People present an idealized version of themselves online and we expect to have social lives like those we see in the media says Challis Comparing the perfect lives of our friends with our own lives can lead us to withdraw socially Meditation techniques and apps such as Headspace are trendy solutions frequently recommended for a range of mental health problems but theyre not necessarily helpful for loneliness as they actively encourage us to be alone with our thoughts It is better to address the causes of your loneliness first whats stopping you going out and seeing people says Challis Indeed a study of social media at the University of Michigan in 2013 found that using technology to help you meet new people can be beneficial And if you are unable to go out for some reason the internet can help you For example Mumsnet an online network for parents can help you feel less alone when bringing up young children Helplines can also reduce loneliness at least in the short term One in four men who call the emotional support charity Samaritans mention loneliness or isolation and Get Connected is a free confidential helpline for young people where they can get help with emotional and mental health problems often linked to loneliness There are also support services on websites such as Minds that can remind you youre not alone At work it can be beneficial to tell your employer how youre feeling John Binns advises businesses on mental health and wellbeing He was admitted to hospital for stressrelated depression in 2007 and took two months off work He felt as if there was no one to talk to and wasnt close enough to colleagues for them to notice the changes in his behaviour More openness with his employer and colleagues made his return to work easier Office chitchat may seem like a waste of time but it helps to protect us from the emotional and psychological effects of work strain We treat the networks we have as incidental but theyre fundamental to our wellbeing says Nicky Forsythe a psychotherapist and the founder of Talk for Health an organization that trains people to give and receive support in groups The most important thing is to have a regular time and place to reflect on your life and to have an empathetic listener If we believe recent research loneliness is killing the elderly and with an ageing population we should aim to reduce our isolation before it is too late Getting older doesnt have to mean getting lonelier says Ruth Sutherland the chief executive of the relationship counselling service Relate But it is very important to lay the foundations to goodquality relationships earlier in life,People are talking a lot about loneliness at the moment The Office for National Statistics says that Britain is the loneliest place in Europe British people have fewer strong friendships than other Europeans and they know their neighbours less well Research at the University of Chicago has found that loneliness is twice as bad for older peoples health as obesity They also found that loneliness causes almost as many deaths as poverty This is shocking but these studies do not talk about loneliness in younger adults In 2010 a Mental Health Foundation survey found that loneliness was a bigger worry for young

not when they replace facetoface contact People present perfect versions of themselves online and we expect to have social lives like the lives we see in the media says Challis If we compare the perfect lives of our friends with our own lives this can make us want to stay at home alone A study of social media at the University of Michigan in 2013 found that using technology to help you meet new people can be a good thing And if you cant go out the internet can help you For example Mumsnet an online network for parents can help you feel less alone when you are at home with young children

31,On the market square in Rjukan stands a statue of the towns founder a respected Norwegian engineer and businessman called Sam Eyde The great man looks north across the square at a mountainside in front of him Behind him to the south rises the 1800metre peak known as Gaustatoppen Between the mountains along the narrow Vestfjord valley lies the small but once powerful town that Eyde built at the beginning of the last century so the workers in his factories could live there Eyde used the power of the 100metre Rjukanfossen waterfall to make hydroelectricity in what was at the time the worlds biggest power plant But one thing he couldnt do was change the sun Deep in its eastwest valley surrounded by high mountains Rjukan and its 3400 inhabitants are in shadow for half the year During the day from late September to midMarch the town three hours northwest of Oslo is not completely dark but its certainly not bright either Now high on the mountain opposite Eydes statue 450 metres above the town three large solarpowered computercontrolled mirrors slowly track the movement of the sun across the sky They reflect the sunshine down on to the square and fill it with bright sunlight Its the sun grins Ingrid Sparbo lifting her face to the light and closing her eyes A retired secretary Sparbo has lived all her life in Rjukan and says people do sort of get used to the shade You end up not thinking about it really But this this is so warming Not just physically but mentally Its mentally warming Two young mothers bring their children into the square and stand in the sun On a freezing day an elderly couple sit on one of the new benches smiling at the warmth on their faces Children smile Lots of people take photographs A shop assistant Silje Johansen says its awesome Just awesome

more than I expected she says This will bring much happiness Across the road in the Nye Tider caf sits the man who created this unexpected happiness Martin Andersen is a 40yearold artist who moved to Rjukan in the summer of 2001 The idea of an artwork Andersen called the Solspeil or Sun mirror came to him at the end of one September Every day we would take our young child for a walk he says and every day I realized we were having to go a little further down the valley to find the sun By 28 September the sun completely disappears from Rjukans market square It doesnt reappear until 12 March In the months between September and March Andersen says Wed look up and see blue sky above and the sun high on the mountain slopes but the only way we could get to it was to go out of town Its sad a town that people have to leave in order to feel the sun Twelve years after he first dreamed of his Solspeil a German company specializing in CSP concentrated solar power brought in by helicopter the three 17sqm glass mirrors that now stand high above the market square in Rjukan It took he says a bit longer than wed imagined It really works Even the people who were against it at first agree that it works I was strongly against it admits Nils Eggerud Like many others he felt that the money should have been spent on other things on extra carers to look after Rjukans old people perhaps or improved school facilities cycle paths and roads And I still dont know about the continued maintenance costs he says What will they be who will pay them But well it does feel nice standing here And really you just have to look at the peoples faces In his office overlooking the square Rjukans young mayor Steinar Bergsland is interested not so much in the cost but in the benefits the mirrors might bring to the town Already Bergsland says visitor numbers are higher than usual for the time of year and Rjukans shopkeepers have reported that they are earning more money than usual A hitech company is interested in moving to Rjukan attracted by the cuttingedge technology at the top of the mountain and the publicity it has attracted This is a powerful symbol for Rjukan Bergsland says and helped by government grants and a donation from a local business the town needed to find just 1m krone 100000 of the mirrors total 5mkrone cost And he says just look out of the window Look at those happy faces

69,Governments across Europe dream of nding a magic solution to rising unemployment But in the hardesthit parts of the EU unemployment continues to rise and the talk does little to reduce the number of people without work Now in a corner of Italy one mayor thinks he has found an answer to his towns serious lack of work Valter Piscedda the mayor of Elmas a small town near Sardinias capital Cagliari wants to pay residents to leave The council will pay for ten unemployed locals to take intensive English lessons get on a cheap ight and look for jobs elsewhere in Europe This idea is a result of common sense and experience the mayor told the Guardian Over the past year and a half especially in the past few months I have been seeing young people almost every day who are despairing about their search for work Some ask for help in nding it here Others have tried everything and are so discouraged that they no longer want to stay and wait And they want to go and gain work experience abroad life experience too So my idea was this put everything in place so that those who want to gain experience abroad are able to he said As the national economy continues to falter Sardinia along with much of southern and central Italy is struggling with high unemployment Unemployment was at 177 in the second quarter of 2014 according to Italys National Institute of Statistics Istat More than 54 of people under 25 are out of work For the Adesso Parto Now Im leaving programme Elmass council will give 12000 on a rstcome rstserved basis to applicants aged between 18 and 50 They just have to be out of work and have lived in the town for three years They do not have to be university educated and their annual income must be no more than 15000 The idea of encouraging people to leave is sensitive at a time when huge numbers of Italians many of them bright young graduates are leaving their country every year But Piscedda who belongs to the Democratic Party of the Prime Minister Matteo Renzi believes that the people he is sending away might return and give me back 100 times what they were given More importantly he wants the scheme to help those most in need Its a programme for those with no other resource its the lastchance saloon It will allow them the dignity of not having to ask a friend for money or put burdens on families he said Earlier in 2014 he added the council launched a scheme for businesses they were given nancial incentives to hire young workers from Elmas We advertised 20 of these positions he said We got 120 applications In Elmas the scheme

worthwhile The son of a friend of mine who didnt study much is in London and hes really nding his way He started as a waiter Now hes a cook and hes learning English Others were perplexed I heard about it but I thought it was strange If you have that money to pay for people to go away why dont you use that money to keep them here said Consuelo Melis who works behind the bar in a local cafe On Twitter one of many reactions was disbelief The states admission of defeat commented Marco Patavino Institutions are raising the white ag remarked Carlo Mazzaggio Piscedda however says of his online critics Probably they are people that arent in need Every day I deal with peoples problems and I have to do something to try to solve them These people if they had an alternative they wouldnt be asking for help The work I can create as mayor is temporary I can have a piazza cleaned I can have it cleaned again I can have the streets cleaned But these are all temporary things that give nothing beyond that little bit of money for a few months I want to go beyond that,Governments in Europe dream of nding a magic solution to rising unemployment But in the poorest parts of the EU unemployment continues to rise Now in Sardinia Italy a mayor thinks he has found an answer to his towns unemployment problem Valter Piscedda the mayor of Elmas a small town near Sardinias capital Cagliari wants to pay residents to leave The town will pay for ten unemployed local people to take English lessons get on a cheap ight and look for jobs in other parts of Europe This idea comes from common sense and experience he told the Guardian In the past year and a half especially in the past few months I have seen young people almost every day who have lost hope that they will nd work Some ask for help in nding work here Others have tried everything and now they want to go and gain work experience abroad life experience too So he decided to help people who want to gain experience abroad Sardinia and also much of southern and central Italy is struggling with high unemployment Unemployment was at 177 in the second quarter of 2014 according to Italys National Institute of Statistics More than 54 of people under 25 are out of work For the Adesso Parto Now Im leaving programme Elmas will give 12000 to the rst ten applicants aged between 18 and 50 The applicants must be out of work and have lived in the town for three years They do not have to be university educated and they must not earn more than 15000 The idea of helping people to leave is sensitive at a time when many Italians many of them clever young graduates are leaving their country every year But Piscedda believes that the people he is sending away might return and give me back 100 times what we gave them More importantly he wants the scheme to help the people most in need In Elmas the scheme has got mixed reactions There is little work here said Alessandro Macis The opportunity to go abroad to learn about the workplace and experience other cultures can be very worthwhile The son of a friend of mine who didnt study much is in London and hes doing very well He started as a waiter Now hes a cook and hes learning English Others were not sure I heard about it but I thought it was strange If you have that money to pay for people to go away why dont you use that money to keep them here said Consuelo Melis who works in a

63,When Larry Pizzi first heard about electric bikes nearly 20 years ago he asked Why would anyone want to screw up a bike by putting a motor and batteries on it Its a question that still puzzles some people Bicycle shops in the US do not usually sell ebikes even though they have been around since the late 1990s Pizzi who is now CEO of Currie Technologies the number one seller of ebikes in the US believes thats about to change Others in the bike industry agree Familiar brands including Trek Raleigh and Specialized all offer electric models and they believe that the market is about to take off The US is different from other countries when it comes to electric bikes Nearly 32m ebikes were sold in 2014 most of them in China where they are mostly used for transportation They are popular in much of Europe too Theyre common in the Netherlands and Switzerland German postal workers use them to get around and BMW offers one for about 3000 Electric bikes are different from motorcycles or mopeds which rely on motorized power they are bicycles that can be pedalled with or without help from an electric motor Riding an ebike feels like riding a normal bike with a strong wind behind you the motor just helps you go faster or climb hills Unlike mopeds ebicycles are usually permitted on bike paths and they cant travel faster than 20mph To succeed the electric bike business in the US must overcome legal cultural and financial obstacles Ebikes are banned in some states including New York Some people who own and work in bike shops dont like putting motors on bicycles one of the reasons is the extra weight Some ebikes weigh nearly 30kg Ebikes are also expensive While cheaper models sell for as little as 700 Court Rye the founder and editor of ElectricBikeReviewcom a popular website says riders should expect to pay at least 1500 for a quality ebike with a good battery The best models cost more than twice that The companies that make and sell ebikes say they can overcome those obstacles Ebike technology particularly the batteries is improving Batteries are getting smaller theyre getting lighter theyre getting more reliable and they are lasting longer says Don DiCostanza the founder and CEO of Pedego an electric bikemaker and retailer Companies like Bosch the German electronics giant and Shimano the leading manufacturer of bicycle gears are entering the business This should help lower the resistance from bike shops This has really caught the attention and the imagination of bicycle dealers says Curries Larry Pizzi Pedego and startup ElectroBike arent waiting for the shops to come around they are building their own stores Perhaps most importantly more cities are building cycling infrastructure including bike lanes so bicycle commuting has become more popular As the US Census Bureau reported in 2014 the number of bike commuters grew from about 488000 in 2000 to 786000 in 2012 Electric bikes make commuting more practical and fun by reducing worry about hills headwinds tiredness and sweat Most of our customers are ageing baby boomers who want to have the cycling experience they had as a kid says Pedegos Don DiCostanza The main reason they stopped riding bikes was because of hills Pedego has opened nearly 60 stores in the US and it has sold bikes to tour companies in San Francisco and Washington DC ElectroBike which operates 30 stores in Mexico opened its first American store in Venice Beach California in the autumn of 2014 and hopes to grow to 25 US stores in a year CEO Craig Anderson says We want to help reduce traffic help reduce our carbon footprint and encourage a healthy lifestyle He tells customers Ride this once and try not to smile Startups like Pedego and ElectroBike will have to compete with big companies like Trek and Currie which in 2012 was acquired by the Accell Group a public company based in the Netherlands that is Europes market leader in ebikes Accell owns the Raleigh brand as well as Haibike an awardwinning German electric bike Accell has great hopes for ebikes in North America Curries Larry Pizzi says While baby boomers are still very important were finding that a lot of younger people are using ebikes for transportation instead of cars Accells Yuba brand even sells a cargo bike with a stronger motor and rear rack You can carry two children says Pizzi You can carry 45kg of shopping Its a minivan alternative,When Larry Pizzi first heard about electric bikes nearly 20 years ago he asked Why would anyone want to spoil a bike by putting a motor and batteries on it Its a question that some people still ask Many bicycle shops in the US do not sell ebikes Pizzi is CEO of Currie Technologies the number one seller of ebikes in the US He believes that things will change very soon Other

83,The Chief Medical Officer for England has compared the problem of antibiotic resistance to the risks of international terrorism But in fact each year the global number of deaths caused by bacterial resistance is far more than the number of deaths caused by terrorist attacks The World Health Organization estimates that just for tuberculosis multidrug resistance kills more than 150000 people each year Antibiotic resistance is now a real risk this is now a war In the past hundred years our expectations of life and survival have changed beyond all recognition At the beginning of the twentieth century life expectancy in the UK was around 47 years of age for a man and 50 for a woman a number heavily affected by the very high rate of infant mortality in those days Around a third of all deaths were in children under the age of five mostly because of infectious disease However a child born in Britain today has more than a one in four chance of reaching their 100th birthday For this we have public health systems vaccination and antibiotics to thank It is thanks to this the prevention and treatment of illnesses caused by microorganisms that the real war against disease is mainly won It is in intensive care my specialist area that antibiotic resistant organisms are most common Here powerful antibiotics essential in the treatment of lifethreatening illness are used routinely These drugs kill ordinary bacteria But they leave behind strong bacteria that have begun to learn how to survive antibiotic drugs As a newly qualified doctor in the late 1990s I learnt about Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus the infamous MRSA a bacterial species resistant to methicillin and all other penicillins In the fight against it there were a small number of drugs like vancomycin and teicoplanin These were supposed to be our defence but antibiotic resistant bacteria became more and more common bacteria with new kinds of resistance became more common too Drugs we had previously hardly heard of became common We got used to this a slow increase in the arms race between us and the bacteria But the balance has been slowly moving In our hospitals and our GP surgeries we have abused the drugs that gave us such a huge advantage over infectious disease we use them too often And some of the worst abuses have happened outside of healthcare with antibiotics introduced into the food chain through agriculture and by putting antibacterial drugs into food for farm animals We thought that antibiotic therapy was an advantage we could enjoy forever We became complacent that the pharmaceutical industry would continue to stay ahead of the game But this is no longer the case New more resistant species have been found The vancomycin that we used to treat MRSA infection no longer worked Vancomycin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus VRSA appeared in our hospitals And other bacteria were learning resistance Enterobacteria also became resistant to vancomycin Today infections with highly resistant organisms are common and the pharmaceutical industry is not keeping up Fewer and fewer new antimicrobial drugs are produced It is becoming more and more difficult to develop new drugs that work against resistant bacteria For every method of attack the pharmaceutical companies invent bacteria quickly form a defence We have tried all of the simple approaches to the problem Antibiotics have become drugs that are expensive to develop that are only used in short courses and that quickly become ineffective due to the changes in bacterial resistance As a result the pharmaceutical industrys incentive to create new drugs that can fight them is low Antibiotics became common in the 1940s and almost straight away we saw the first evidence of bacteria resistance Today this has become a normal part of medical life Less than a century after the discovery of penicillin we are beginning to lose the fight Since the first MRSA deaths in healthy children in the US in 1998 the number of deaths from MRSA infection in the US each year has increased to tens of thousands far more than the number of deaths caused by AIDS Bacterial resistance in hospitals is everywhere This is a war different from any other There needs to be change in the way doctors prescribe antibiotics and fewer antibiotics used in farming and agriculture And we have to find a way to convince the pharmaceutical companies to develop these less profitable drugs If we are going to avoid a return to the preantibiotic time with all its excess mortality we must make some big changes To lose the advantage we have against microorganisms in the fight for life would be unthinkable,The Chief Medical Officer for England compared the problem of antibiotic resistance to the risks of international terrorism But each year the number of deaths around the world from bacterial resistance is far more than the number of deaths from terrorist attacks The World Health Organization says that each year more than 150000 people die from tuberculosis because of antibiotic resistance This is now a war A hundred years ago life expectancy in the UK was about 47 years for a man and 50 years for a woman Lots of young children died About 30 of all deaths were in children under the age of five mostly because of infectious disease But a child born in Britain today has more than a 25 chance of reaching their 100th birthday We can thank public health systems vaccination and antibiotics for this In intensive care antibiotic resistant bacteria are most common Here powerful antibiotics are used very often These drugs kill ordinary bacteria But they cannot kill strong bacteria that have begun to learn how to survive antibiotic drugs When I became a doctor in the 1990s I learnt about Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus MRSA is a bacteria that is resistant to methicillin and all other penicillins There were just a few drugs that could kill it for example vancomycin and teicoplanin But antibiotic resistant bacteria became more and more common In our hospitals and our doctors surgeries we use antiobiotics too often Also we have put antibiotics into the food chain when we grow food and when we put antibacterial drugs into food for farm animals We thought that antibiotics were something we could use forever We thought that companies would continue to make more and more antibiotics But this is no longer true We have found new more resistant bacteria The vancomycin that we used to treat MRSA infection no longer worked We found Vancomycin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus VRSA in our hospitals And other bacteria were becoming resistant too Today infections with organisms that are very resistant are common but fewer and fewer new antibiotic drugs are made It is more and more difficult to develop new drugs that can kill resistant bacteria Antibiotics have become drugs that are expensive to develop that are only used in short courses and that quickly stop working because of bacterial resistance This war against bacteria is different from all other wars There needs to be change in the way doctors give antibiotics and we need to use fewer antibiotics in farming And we have to give companies good reasons why they should make new antibiotics which will not make them lots of money Today antibiotic resistance has become a normal part of life Less than a hundred years after the discovery of penicillin we are beginning to lose the fight,test,INT,ELE
114,Many of us know we dont get enough sleep but imagine if we could x it with a fairly simple solution getting up later In a speech at the British Science Festival Dr Paul Kelley of the Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute at Oxford University said schools should stagger their starting times to work with the natural biological rhythms of their students It would improve cognitive performance exam results and students health lack of sleep can cause diabetes depression obesity and immune system problems In 2014 he published a paper in which he noted that when children are around ten their biological wakeup time is about 630am at 16 this rises to 8am and at 18 someone you may think is just a lazy teenager actually has a natural waking hour of 9am The normal school starting time works for 10yearolds but not for 16 to 18yearolds For the older teenagers it might be more sensible to start the school day at 11am or even later A 7am alarm call for older teenagers Kelley and his colleagues wrote in the paper is the equivalent of a 430am start for a teacher in their 50s He says the solution is not to persuade teenagers to go to bed earlier The bodys natural rhythm is controlled by a particular kind of light says Kelley The eye contains cells that report to a part of the brain that controls our circadian rhythms over a 24hour cycle Its the light that controls it Its like saying Why cant you control your heartbeat But it isnt just students who would bene t from a later start Kelley says the working day should be more linked to our natural rhythms Describing the average sleep loss per night for different age groups he says Between 14 and 24 its more than two hours For people aged between 24 and about 30 or 35 its about an hour and a half That can continue up until youre about 55 when its in balance again The 10yearold and 55yearold wake and sleep naturally at the same time This might be why he adds the traditional nine to ve is so ingrained bosses control working hours and many of them are in their mid50s and older so it is best for them So should workplaces have staggered starting times too Should those in their 50s and above come in at 8am while those in their 30s start at 10am and the teenage apprentice be encouraged to start at 11am Kelley says that synchronized hours could have many positive consequences The positive side of this is peoples performance mood and health will improve Its very uplifting because its a solution that will make people less ill and happier and better at what they do There would probably be fewer accidents because drivers would be more alert he says It could mean the end of rush hour as people staggered their work and schoolrun times A later start to the day for many says Kelley is something that would bene t all people particularly families Parents go and try to wake up teenagers who are waking up three hours too early It creates tensions for everybody So what time does Kelley start work I am 67 so that means Im like a 10yearold and I get up just after six I wake naturally And yes he says he nds the start of his working day much easier now than he did when he was younger,Many of us know we dont

49,Wellknown British author David Mitchell is used to the critics analysing his novels in detail So its a relief he says that his latest work wont be seen by anyone until 2114 He completed it at 1am one Tuesday morning before a car arrived to take him to the airport to catch a flight to Norway Mitchell is the second contributor to the Scottish artist Katie Patersons Future Library project for which 1000 trees were planted in 2014 in Oslos Nordmarka forest The first author Margaret Atwood handed over the manuscript of a text called Scribbler Moon in 2015 Each year for the next 100 years an author will deliver a piece of writing that will only be read in 2114 when the trees are chopped down to make paper on which the 100 texts will be printed Each author their names revealed year by year and chosen by a panel of experts and Paterson while she is alive will travel to the spot in the forest high above Oslo where they will hand over their manuscripts in a short ceremony Its a little glimmer of hope in a season when there has been lots of very depressing news which shows that we are in with a chance of civilization in a hundred years said Mitchell Everything is telling us that were doomed but the Future Library brings hope that we are more resilient than we think that we will be here that there will be trees that there will be books and readers and civilization Mitchell said he found writing the book quite liberating because I wont be around to take the consequences of this being good or bad But Im sandwiched between Margaret Atwood and no doubt some other brilliant writer So it had better be good Id look such a fool if they opened it in 2114 and it wasnt any good Mitchell says that he usually polishes and polishes his writing Actually I overpolish But this was very different I wrote till the final minute So the first twothirds were polished and the final third I didnt have time And it was a liberation Future Library creator Paterson asked the writers to write on the theme of imagination and time which they can take in so many directions Mitchell revealed only the name of the manuscript From Me Flows What You Call Time during a ceremony in the Norwegian woods next to where Patersons 1000 trees are planted The title is taken from a piece of music by Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu But other than admitting that its more substantial than I was expecting the author would say nothing more Handing over his text in the forest Mitchell read his audience of children and adults a short story and William Wordsworths A slumber did my spirit seal Its ending Rolled round in earths diurnal course With rocks and stones and trees felt appropriate in this small section of forest which will be carefully tended to for the next 98 years before it is turned into Future Librarys manuscripts How vain to think that my scribblings will be of enduring interest to future generations Yet how lowkey and understated to slave over a manuscript that nobody will ever congratulate you for and say Nice one or God I loved the bit where she did that and he did this Mitchell wrote in a piece for the Future Library His manuscript now delivered will be sealed and placed alongside Atwoods in a woodlined room in Oslos new public library which will open in 2019 Watched over by a panel of experts until it is finally printed it is now says the novelist as gone from me as a coin dropped in a river,The critics usually analyse the novels of wellknown British author David Mitchell in detail But he is not worried about the critics this time He completed his latest book at 1am one Tuesday morning before a car arrived to take him to the airport to catch a flight to Norway No one will see this novel until 2114 Mitchell is the second author to be part of the Future Library project For the project they planted 1000 trees in 2014 in Oslos Nordmarka forest The first author Margaret Atwood gave the manuscript of a text called Scribbler Moon to the project in 2015 Each year for the next hundred years an author will write a novel that people will only read in 2114 when the trees are cut down to make paper to make the books Each author will travel to the place in the forest high above Oslo where they will give their manuscripts to the project in a short ceremony Its a little bit of hope at a time when there is lots of very depressing news It shows that we have a chance of civilization in a hundred years said Mitchell Everything is telling us that were doomed but the Future Library brings hope that we are stronger than we think that we will be here that there will be trees that there will be books and readers and civilization Mitchell said that writing this book made him feel free because I wont be around to know if people think its good or bad But before me was Margaret Atwood and next year Im sure there will be another brilliant writer So my book had better be good I would look such a fool if they opened my book in 2114 and it wasnt any good Mitchell says that he usually polishes and polishes his writing I polish too much But this was very different I wrote till the final minute So the first twothirds are polished and the final

What You Call Time during a ceremony in the Norwegian woods next to where the 1000 trees are planted The title comes from a piece of music by Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu Mitchell only told us that his book is longer than I thought it would be He said nothing more In the forest Mitchell read a short story and a poem This small section of forest will be carefully managed for the next 98 years before it becomes Future Librarys manuscripts How vain to think my writing will be of interest to future generations But it is the opposite of vain to work hard on a manuscript that nobody will ever congratulate you for and say Good job or I loved the bit where she did that and he did this Mitchell wrote They will seal his manuscript and put it next to Atwoods manuscript in a room in Oslos

154,As soon as the children at one primary school in Stirling Scotland hear the words daily mile they put down their pencils and leave the classroom to start running around the school eld For threeandahalf years all the pupils at St Ninians Primary School have walked or run a mile each day They do it at different times during the day and despite the rise in childhood obesity across the UK none of the children at the school are overweight The daily mile has done so much to improve these childrens tness behaviour and concentration in lessons that many other British schools are doing the same They are getting pupils to get up from their desks and take 15 minutes to walk or run round the school or local park Elaine Wyllie headteacher of St Ninians said I get at least two emails a day from other schools and local authorities asking how we do it The thought of children across the country running every day because of something weve done is phenomenal One in ten children are obese

ever been Primary schools therefore accept the bene ts of the daily mile It has been introduced in schools in various parts of the UK and other schools are planning to launch the initiative during the 201516 academic year In Stirling alone 30 schools have already started or will soon start the daily mile Its a commonsense approach to childrens tness which is free and easy The most important thing is that the children really enjoy it otherwise you couldnt sustain it They come back inside brighteyed and rosycheeked how children used to look said Wyllie At St Ninians teachers take their pupils out of lessons to a specially built circuit around the schools playing eld for their daily mile whenever it best suits that days timetable Only ice or very heavy rain stop them The extent of the bene ts isnt known yet but researchers from Stirling University have launched a comparative study to look for evidence of the physical cognitive and emotional bene ts of the daily mile Dr Colin Moran who is leading the study said The children dont seem to have problems with obesity they seem happier and staff say they settle into lessons faster so we designed a study that would test all of these things St Ninians pupils will be compared with children from another school in Stirling that hasnt yet started the scheme Kevin Clelland a primary school teacher from Leeds visited St Ninians and then

Officials said almost 1200 people had been injured with more than 40 taken to hospital most as a result of flying glass shattered by the sonic boom created by the meteorites fall There were no reported deaths The meteorite entered the atmosphere travelling at a speed of at least 33000mph and broke up into pieces between 18 and 32 miles above the ground according to a statement from the Russian Academy of Sciences The event caused panic in Chelyabinsk a city of more than one million people to the south of Russias Ural mountains A video showed the pieces of meteorite glowing more brightly as they approached the moment of impact The vapour trail was visible for hundreds of miles around including in neighbouring Kazakhstan Tatyana Bets was at work in the reception area of a hospital clinic in the centre of the city when the meteorite hit First we noticed the wind and then the room was filled with a very bright light and we could see a cloud of smoke in the sky she said Then after a few minutes the explosions came At least three craters were discovered according to the Ministry of the Interior One crater was more than six metres wide and another piece of the meteorite broke through the thick ice of a nearby lake In Chelyabinsk itself schools and universities were closed and many other staff told to go home early About 200 children were among the injured A steady stream of lightly injured people most suffering cuts from flying glass came into the clinic where Bets works She said a nearby building for college students was particularly badly affected and many of the students were brought in There were a lot of girls in shock Some were very pale and many of them fainted she said Early estimates suggested more than 100000 square metres of glass had been broken and 3000 buildings hit The total cost of the damage in the city was being valued at more than one billion roubles 20m The meteorite over Chelyabinsk arrived less than a day before asteroid 2012 DA14 was expected to pass Earth very closely about 17510 miles But experts said the two events were not connected There were lots of rumours and conspiracy theories however in the first few hours after the incident Reports on Russian state television and in local media suggested that the meteorite was blown apart by local air defence units at an altitude of more than 15 miles The ultranationalist leader of Russias Liberal Democrat party Vladimir Zhirinovsky said it was not a meteorite but military action by the United States Its not a meteorite falling its a test of new American weapons Zhirinovsky said Some were quick to take advantage Enterprising people were offering pieces of meteorite for sale through internet sites within a few hours of the impact President Vladimir Putin and the Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev were informed about the incident and Putin called a meeting with the head of the Emergency Situations Ministry Its proof that not only are

99,Angry waiters are asking for public support in a battle to keep their tips PizzaExpress branches are to be targeted by protesters in an attempt to get the restaurant chain to stop taking a proportion of tips for staff that have been paid on credit and debit cards Campaigners have also started an online petition in the hope that restaurantgoers will support their demands PizzaExpress keeps as an admin fee 8p out of every 1 paid when tips are given by card This is a policy that has made some employees angry The chain which has 430 branches around the UK and is particularly popular with families makes around 1m a year from the practice according to the union Unite We believe this 8 fee is unfair and that if the chain values its staff it should be paying them the total tips they are given by customers said Chantal Chegrinec of Unite We are starting with PizzaExpress but they are not the only ones and we will turn our attention to other companies after this The protests are being organized by local branches of Unite The rst is taking place at the British Museum branch of PizzaExpress in London The union has also written to the restaurant chains CEO Unite began the campaign following a survey of its PizzaExpress members after the chain was sold to a Chinese company in 2014 One of the top issues was the 8 deduction from their tips One disgruntled PizzaExpress employee who wants to remain anonymous said that the admin fee was costing her 3 a night I have worked at PizzaExpress for 15 years she said in a letter to Unite After all this time Im still only paid the national minimum wage of 650 an hour So you see my colleagues and I are very reliant on customer tips to top up our low wages I work hard and am good at my job but when PizzaExpress thinks it can get away with taking a percentage of our hardearned tips left on a card I get upset Ask and Zizzi two other restaurant chains also deduct 8 of the tips paid by card But other chains deduct even more Cafe Rouge Bella Italia and Belgo deduct 10 so do Strada and Giraffe A spokesperson for PizzaExpress said that its admin charge was to cover the cost of running a tronc a pay arrangement used to distribute tips among staff We made big efforts to set up this tronc system which is run by staff They independently decide how tips made by electronic card payment are distributed between the restaurant teams it is a system run by employees for the employees she said The chain which sells 29m pizzas a year in its UK restaurants denied that it pro ts from the admin fee But other restaurant groups do not deduct an admin fee from tips Wagamama Pizza Hut and TGI Friday all take nothing Frankie Bennys Chiquitos and Garfunkels used to charge 10 but they stopped doing this several years ago Unite recently targeted ten PizzaExpress restaurants in south London they distributed lea ets to customers who were shocked and disgusted by the practice PizzaExpress says the charge is mentioned in small print at the bottom of its menus But the employee who wrote to Unite said that when she mentioned the charge to customers they were always surprised Most customers would then pay the tip in cash Almost 6000 people have signed Unites online petition One waiter who doesnt work for PizzaExpress but has worked for 11 years for another restaurant chain said that at least a third of his income is from tips He doesnt want to be identi ed because he is scared there will be reprisals I work in a busy London branch and on an average night I serve 150 people and earn 40 to 50 in tips he says That might sound like a lot but that money is crucial to me because my basic pay is only 650 an hour Conservative MP Andrew Percy has asked for a change in the law that would give restaurant staff more control over tips He said he plans to raise the issue in parliament,Angry waiters are asking people to support their battle to keep their tips Protesters plan to target PizzaExpress restaurants to try to get the restaurant chain to stop taking a percentage of tips for staff that have been paid on credit and debit cards Protesters have also started an online petition they hope that people who go to

even more Cafe Rouge Bella Italia and Belgo deduct 10 Strada and Giraffe do too A spokesperson for PizzaExpress said that the money they take from tips pays for a system that they use to share the tips among staff Staff use this system to decide how to share tips made by card she said The chain sells 29 million pizzas a year in its UK restaurants It says it does not make a pro t from the admin fee But other restaurant groups do not deduct an admin fee from tips Wagamama Pizza Hut and TGI Friday all take nothing Frankie Bennys Chiquitos and Garfunkels used to take 10 but stopped years ago

11,It began with a bogus scallop but a menu scandal that has affected some of Japans top hotels and department stores now threatens the international reputation of the countrys food Since one luxury hotel chain admitted lying about ingredients on its menus Japanese media have written stories of similar incidents in restaurants run by wellknown hotels and department stores The story began when the HankyuHanshin hotel chain based in Osaka admitted it had given false descriptions of dozens of menu items at some of its restaurants between 2006 and October 2013 which affected an estimated 78000 diners One of the worst menu misdemeanours was a red salmon caviar dish that was actually the less luxurious eggs of the flying fish The hotel groups president Hiroshi Desaki went on television to announce a 20 pay cut for himself and 10 for other executives but this did not make consumers any less angry Days later Desaki resigned saying that the hotel group had betrayed our customers One of the hotels head chefs later declined a medal of honour he was going to receive from the government The company has so far refunded 20 million yen to more than 10000 consumers The final bill is expected to reach 110 million yen Consumers who believed they had eaten expensive kuruma shrimps were told they had in fact eaten the much cheaper black tiger version The scandal started when a diner complained in a blogpost that a scallop dish he had ordered at the Prince Hotel in Tokyo contained a similar but cheaper type of shellfish The hotel started an investigation and as a result corrected more than 50 menu items at dozens of its restaurants Its report scared HankyuHanshin and other hoteliers into admitting that they too had hoodwinked diners who believed they were paying high prices for top ingredients The Hotel Okura chain whose guests have included Barack Obama said they had also injected beef with fat to make it juicier and incorrectly described tomatoes as organic We deeply apologize for betraying the expectations and confidence of our clients it said in a statement The list of fraudulent ingredients continues to grow orange juice from cartons sold as freshly squeezed Mont Blanc desserts topped with Korean chestnuts instead of the promised French ones shopbought chocolate cream that the menu said was homemade imported beef sold as expensive wagyu Even the governments top spokesman Yoshihide Suga commented on the scandal This inappropriate labelling has resulted in the loss of trust among consumers he told reporters The fraudulent menu scandal has exploded at just the wrong time Japan is trying to persuade South Korea and other countries to lift a ban on food imports that began after the Fukushima nuclear accident And UNESCO is considering a request to add Japanese cuisine to its cultural heritage list One local newspaper had the headline Japans proud food culture in tears while the newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun said it was shocked by the industrys lack of morals Industry experts said the global financial crisis in 2008 had forced luxury hotels to cut costs while attempting to woo diners with detailed menu descriptions Menu descriptions were created to meet consumers preferences and when they couldnt get the ingredients on the menu hotels just used food from different places Hiroshi Tomozawa a hotel and restaurant consultant told Kyodo News The industrys biggest problem will come from Japans demanding consumers In 2009 72 of diners in Japan said that when they were choosing from a menu where the food is from was the most important thing for them followed by the amount of calories and other nutritional details,A menu scandal at some of Japans top hotels and department stores is damaging the international reputation of Japanese food One luxury hotel group admitted that it lied about ingredients on its menus Since then there have been similar stories from restaurants run by famous hotels and department

125,A new hightech computerassisted autopsy system is becoming more and more popular in European hospitals Its inventor has said the technique could eventually mean there is no such thing as a perfect murder The method called Virtopsy is now being used at some forensic medical institutes in Europe after it was pioneered by a group of scientists at the University of Zurich A traditional autopsy begins by using a knife to make a Yshaped cut in the chest But now pathologists are able to examine the dead body in 3D via computer screens Michael Thali the Director of Zurichs Institute for Forensic Medicine in Europe and one of the inventors of Virtopsy said it had the potential to revolutionize criminal investigations Basically there will be no such thing as the perfect murder any more because a virtual autopsy allows you to find every piece of evidence he said Virtopsies combine the images from highpowered magnetic resonance imaging MRI computed tomography CT and surface scans of dead bodies Combined the machines are referred to as a Virtobot The technique allows you to find injuries that are not seen during a traditional autopsy as well as air pockets heart attacks and even cancer The Virtopsy might replace the autopsy one day Richard Dirndorfer one of the pioneers of DNA analysis in criminology and a developer of Virtopsy told the German science magazine PM I think well see it happen gradually just like DNA analysis gradually replaced blood group analysis he said The computer imaging techniques allow doctors to see deep inside dead bodies The method has already allowed the discovery of injuries that were not picked up during traditional autopsies At first the aim is to use the new method to complement the traditional autopsy It will allow forensic scientists to plan their autopsies far more efficiently Dominic Wichmann an internal medicine specialist at Hamburgs University Hospital told Spiegel Criminologists from around the world have been travelling to Switzerland over the past few years to see the new method The method had been under development for decades Then a donation from a rich ophthalmologist allowed the project to take off The new generation of forensic scientists and pathologists dont see it as a threat They see it as something that will complement traditional methods and possibly even one day replace them though probably not entirely In order to analyze the colour of the blood the consistencies of body fluids or smells well need to keep on with the traditional cut said Lars Oesterhelweg Deputy Director of the Institute of Forensic Medicine at the Charit Hospital in Berlin which is using a version of the Virtopsy He added that the new method was particularly helpful in reexamining cases where the cause of death was unclear It means that third opinions can be gathered investigations can be reexamined and cases can be reopened he said Scientists using the new method said that relatives of the dead often dont like the idea of autopsies because of the disfigurement they cause They are much happier with the noninvasive method,A new computerassisted autopsy system is becoming more and more popular in European

deep inside dead bodies It can see things that cannot be found during traditional autopsies Criminologists from around the world have been travelling to Switzerland over the past few years to see the new method Forensic scientists and pathologists think the method can be used together with the traditional autopsy In order to analyze the colour of the blood the thickness of body fluids or smells well need to use traditional autopsy methods said Lars Oesterhelweg Deputy Director of the Institute of Forensic Medicine at the Charit Hospital in Berlin which is using a version of the Virtopsy He added that the new method was very helpful in reexamining cases where the cause of death was unclear It means that investigations can be reexamined and we can try again to find the murderer he said Scientists said that relatives of the dead prefer the Virtopsy method because during a traditional autopsy scientists have to cut and damage the dead body,test,INT,ELE

pirated along with 52 million TV shows 29 million films18 million ebooks and 7 million software or games files 18 of internet users aged over 12 say they have pirated items and 9 say they are afraid they will get caught Pullman writes in his article The ease and speed with which people can get music in MP3 is still very surprising to people like me who have been building up their iTunes list for some time After the Downing Street meeting Cameron asked the Conservative MP Mike Weatherley to be his adviser on the subject The BPI an organization that supports music companies said Mike Weatherley is a strong supporter of copyright and the artists and creative producers its there to protect We hope his influence and the prime ministers support for copyright will change how we see illegal downloading in the UK,test,INT,ELE
98,Cities dont often decide to pack their bags get up and move down the road But thats exactly what Kiruna an Arctic town in northern Sweden has to do to avoid being swallowed up into the earth Its a terrible choice says Krister Lindstedt of White the Swedish architects company that is managing the biblical task They have to move this city of 23000 people away from a gigantic ironore mine that is fast swallowing up the ground beneath its streets Either the mine must stop digging creating mass unemployment or the city has to move Founded in 1900 by the stateowned LuossavaaraKiirunavaara mining company LK Kiruna has grown rich off the vast amount of iron ore that is below the town but its now facing destruction by exactly the thing that made it rich The town is here because of the mine says Deputy Mayor Niklas Siren Otherwise no one would have built a city here Located 145km inside the Arctic Circle Kiruna has a brutal climate It has winters with no sunlight and average temperatures below 15C But the iron ore has kept people here It has become the worlds largest underground ironore mine It produces 90 of all the iron in Europe enough to build more than six Eiffel Towers a day And demand continues to grow In 2004 the mining company told the town that its days were numbered digging its shafts towards the city at an angle of 60 degrees subsidence would soon lead to buildings cracking and collapsing Ten years later cracks are starting to appear in the ground and they are creeping closer and closer to the town The people of Kiruna have been living in limbo for ten years says Viktoria Walldin a social anthropologist who works with the architects They have put their lives on hold unable to make major decisions like buying a house redecorating having a child or opening a business After years of dithering the city finally has a plan for how it will proceed Lindstedt has a plan that shows the towns streets and squares beginning to crawl eastwards along a new high street until the whole place has moved safely away from the mine by 2033 A new town square is already being built 3km to the east with a circular town hall planned by Danish architect Henning Larsen Twenty other key buildings will be dismantled and put together piece by piece in their new home like an Ikea flatpack on a bigger scale Kirunas red wooden church built in 1912 and once voted Swedens most beautiful building will take pride of place in a new park and the bell tower will stand once again above the town hall But not everything will be saved I spoke to an old lady who walks past the bench every day where she had her first kiss says Walldin Its things like that the hospital where your first child was born for example that are important to people and all thats going to disappear Called the most democratic move in history the project will get 320m from the mining company for building new facilities including a high school fire station community centre library and swimming hall But the biggest worry for most people is where they will actually live and how they will get a house or flat People are used to very low rents and very high incomes but in future this will have to change says Lindstedt LK has agreed to compensate residents to the value of their homes plus 25 but many locals say this is not enough to afford a newbuild house A closer look at the plan shows the new town does not look like the original Kiruna at all The current town has winding streets and detached houses with gardens Whites plan has multistorey apartment blocks around shared courtyards in long straight streets It is an opportunity say the architects for Kiruna to reinvent itself into a town that will attract young people There will be new cultural facilities and visionary things such as a cable car above the high street But it is a vision that many of the existing residents will probably not be able to afford,Cities dont often move But thats exactly what Kiruna an Arctic town in northern Sweden has to do It has to move or the earth will swallow it up Its a terrible choice says Krister Lindstedt who works for the Swedish architect company that is moving the city They will move this city of 23000 people away from a gigantic ironore mine that is swallowing up the ground beneath its streets Either the mine must stop digging and then there will be no jobs or the city has to move Kiruna was founded in 1900 by the stateowned LuossavaaraKiirunavaara mining company LK The city became rich thanks to the very large amount of iron ore that is below the town But the mine that made it rich is now going to destroy it The town is here because of the mine says Deputy Mayor Niklas Siren Located 145km inside the Arctic Circle Kiruna has a very difficult climate It has winters with no sunlight and average temperatures of 15C But the iron ore has kept people here Kiruna is the worlds largest underground ironore mine It produces 90 of all the iron in Europe That is enough to build more than six Eiffel Towers every day In 2004 the mining company told the town that it would have to move Underground digging would soon cause buildings to crack and collapse Ten years later cracks are starting to appear in the ground nearer and nearer to the town The people of Kiruna have waited for ten years says Viktoria Walldin a social anthropologist who works with the architects They have put their lives on hold unable to make major decisions like buying a house redecorating having a child or opening a business At last the city finally has a plan Lindstedt has a plan that shows the towns streets and squares beginning to move east along a new high street By 2033 the whole city will be far away from the mine They are already building a new town square 3km to the east with a circular town hall planned by Danish architect Henning Larsen They will take apart and put together again 20 other important buildings in their new home Kirunas red wooden church was built in 1912 and once voted Swedens most beautiful building it will be in the centre of a new park But they will not save everything I spoke to an old lady who walks past the bench every day where she had her
